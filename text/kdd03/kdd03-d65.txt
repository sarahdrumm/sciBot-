ABSTRACT We are interested in finding natural communities in largescale linked networks . Our ultimate goal is to track changes over time in such communities . For such temporal tracking , we require a clustering algorithm that is relatively stable under small perturbations of the input data . We have developed an efficient , scalable agglomerative strategy and applied it to the citation graph of the NEC CiteSeer database ( 250,000 papers ; 4.5 million citations ) . Agglomerative clustering techniques are known to be unstable on data in which the community structure is not strong . We find that some communities are essentially random and thus unstable while others are natural and will appear in most clusterings . These natural communities will enable us to track the evolution of communities over time .

INTRODUCTION
In recent years , we have witnessed a surge of interest in the analysis of very large linked data sources . Two common examples of such data sources are the link structure of the World Wide Web and citation graphs of scientific literature . It has become apparent that much interesting structural information is hidden in such networks . It has also been shown that these linked networks have properties that are very different from those of standard random graph models . For example , real world linked networks often have \small world" fiSupported in part by the NSF , AFOSR and the Intelligent Information Systems Institute at Cornell University characteristics , combining properties from highly structured networks with those of random networks [ 14 ] . Also , the node degree distributions are often characterized by power laws , as opposed to exponentially distributed as in standard random graph models .
Another important aspect of these linked data sources is their strong temporal component : these networks continue to evolve over time . So far , much of the analysis of linked networks has focused on static \snapshots" of the underlying graphs . Our goal is to study explicitly the temporal component of linked networks . For example , how do certain structures in the network evolve over time ? In a citation graph , can one identify the emergence of a new scientific community even before the existence of such a community becomes readily apparent from standard statistical properties ? Can one predict the final size of an emerging community ?
Before we can answer these questions we need to be able to produce clusterings that are relatively stable as the linked network evolves . At first glance , hierarchical agglomerative clustering does not seem to be a candidate for stable clustering . Agglomerative clustering is highly unstable on sparse , high dimensional data . This is not surprising since an agglomerative clustering of an n node network produces a tree of n , 1 clusters most of which have no real significance . However , the clustering algorithm is not uniformly unstable . A careful examination of the results of hundreds of runs shows that most clusters vary widely in each clustering . However , a small number of clusters , approximately 160 , appear in every clustering and it is these clusters that correspond to recognizable topics . Thus , the instability is an important tool for finding what we call natural communities and it is these clusters that we will track over time .
In this paper , we illustrate an effective agglomerative algorithm for clustering and a method for identifying stable or natural clusters within the linked network . In Section 2 we examine previous research and related work . Section 3 gives the basic facts about the NEC CiteSeer database , the object of our study . Sections 4 and 5 describe the components of the effecient clustering method . Finally , Section 6 and Section 7 look at clustering instabilities and solutions to that problem via our concept of a natural community .
2 . RELATED WORK
Organizing large document collections via the use of reference information is not a new practice : [ 13 ] did the first computerized clustering of the Science Citation Index prior to 1972 using co citation analysis . They showed it was possible to extract intellectual communities based solely on reference information . More recently , the NEC CiteSeer group succeeded in identifying intellectual communities in the CiteSeer database and on the web using new variants of cocitation analysis [ 11 ] and network flow methods [ 3 ] . This , and other research ( [4] ) , has focused on mapping the current state of link networks like science citation graphs and the Web . The methods presented here are motivated by a desire to understand how these maps change over time . As such , our clustering methods must be relatively stable : the clustering must not change much under small perturbations of the input data .
In many applications , what matters most is not stability but finding an organization of items that , upon human inspection , is coherent . With respect to the CiteSeer document collection , this amounts to identifying key computer science topics like systems and databases using titles and abstracts . However , the importance of stability is gaining recognition . [ 9 ] analysed the stability of the two popular link based ranking algorithms HITS and PageRank . They point out that intuitively we would not want the rankings for a given query to change much if the base data set , for example the World Wide Web , is altered slightly . They go on to develop algorithms that stabilize the HITS rankings . While clustering is even more subjective than ranking , stability is still useful . In this paper we develop algorithms that cluster the CiteSeer data using only reference information and identify stable intellectual communities .
In [ 8 ] , we show how these stable intellectual communities can be used to effectively track the temporal evolution of the community structure in the CiteSeer graph . In particular , we show that by comparing the community structure at different points in time , one can can identify emerging new communities , growing communities , ones that remain stable , and , finally , communities that decrease in importance over time .
3 . DATA SET
We used an October 2001 snapshot of the NEC CiteSeer database [ 5 ] . At that time , the CiteSeer database contained the full text and bibliographies of approximately 250,000 papers , most published since 1990 . These are mostly related to computer science , with a small collection covering other topics like physics , mathematics , and economics . In addition , the database contains title and author information on another 1.6 million earlier papers that are referenced by the 250,000 set but whose full text is not contained in the database .
We analyze the citation graph induced by this data set : vertices correspond to all 1.85 million papers in the database ; there is a directed edge from paper p to paper q if p references q . We call the set of the 250,000 papers whose full text and bibliography are known the core of the citation graph . The papers in the core have citations to each other and to the 1.6 million non core papers . We do not have the reference lists for the papers outside the core . So , their out degree is 0 while their in degree is at least 1 . The out degree ( number of references ) for a typical node ranges from 5 to up to 25 . The median number of references for the core papers is 14 . Interestingly , the majority of core papers are uncited ( in degree = 0 ) . Note that self citations are excluded .
The CiteSeer data has a number of inaccuracies , due to the fact that the information is obtained in a fully automatic manner using web spiders and scripts to find citation infor mation and reference data . There is interesting work trying to improve the classification of information of CiteSeer style systems [ 1 , 10 ] . In this project we do not explicitly remove the \noise" in the CiteSeer graph because our goal is to develop methods and tools that are relatively robust under reasonable noise models .
4 . MEASURING DISTANCE 4.1 Reference based Measures
Two standard bibliometric measures of similarity between two papers p and q are bibliographic coupling [ 7 ] and cocitation analysis [ 12 ] . The bibliographic coupling of papers p and q is the number of references they share in common . The co citation count of p and q is the number of papers that reference both p and q together . Co citation counts more richly describe paper relationships as time passes and people reference ( or ignore ) a given paper . On the other hand , bibliographic coupling can immediately measure similarities since references come with the paper . However , references cannot change : if a relevant and seminal paper appears in 2004 on this topic then our relationship via bibliographic coupling will be indirect at best ; with co citation , the relationship could emerge very clearly . In addition , there is no regulatory apparatus governing who authors’ cite and so citation practices differ from author to author . However , collectively we tend to cite the important papers , which then supports the use of co citation analysis .
However , given that temporal tracking of emerging communities is the ultimate goal , the slowness of co citation buildup is more problematic than the noisiness and static nature of bibliographic coupling .
Furthermore , bibliographic coupling is by no means bad . One can identify intellectual communities from it . When an author writes a paper on a certain topic , they will cite certain papers that characterize the field . In addition , there will be other general references and unique references specific to their contribution . But each topic will have some set of references that a reasonable author would draw from .
Our research focuses on the next logical question : how do new topics , those with unestabilished references , form ? We conjecture that the reference structure of these new papers will change to reflect these shifts , and these changes will not be reflected immediately in co citaton data . Thus , while cocitation measures are quite useful for mapping knowleedge domains , we conjecture that they are too slow for tracking purposes . 4.2 Distance Measure
For the agglomerative clustering , we define the distance between two papers p and q as the number of references in paper p times the number of references in paper q , divided by the number of papers in the intersection of the two papers’ reference sets . In this case , the distance between two papers is infinite if the papers do not share a reference in common.1 For clusters with more than one paper , we use a centroidbased measure to determine distance . It should be stressed that our clusters are dependent on the reference structure of our dataset .
1Of course , once clusters of papers start forming , the implicit relationship between papers that share references via a chain of citations is captured and the distance between clusters is no longer infinite .
For the k means algorithm , we use the standard Euclidean distance ( l2 norm ) to determine to which of the k clusters each paper is closest . Each paper is represented as a 0 1 vector whose length is equal to the total number of papers . For a paper p , the vector for p has a 1 in element q if paper p references paper q , and 0 otherwise . For clusters , the vector is the sum of the vectors of the papers in the cluster . Then , we normalize all the vectors and for every paper we wish to cluster , we compute the Euclidean distance to each of the k clusters .
Euclidean distance is the standard function used for the kmeans algorithm . It is a metric , and as a result the k means cost function decreases after every iteration . We do not use the Euclidean distance for the agglomerative clustering : several experiments have shown that using this function ( as well as other distance functions we have tried ) results in a \skinny" hierarchical clustering tree . In this tree , one cluster tends to dominate early in the running of the algorithm , and then proceeds to grab all the smaller clusters . Our distance function is the only one that we have used that produces a balanced hierarchical clustering tree , which allows us to find smaller communities of topics contained within a single cluster in the tree . In addition , the clusters obtained from running the agglomerative clustering algorithm with our distance function appeared quite coherent { relative to other distance measures { when analyzed with a word frequency count on the titles of the papers in the clusters . The measure is also a simple , intuitive notion of distance .
5 . CLUSTERING 5.1 Background
We considered two standard clustering techniques : hierarchical agglomerative clustering and k means clustering ( see [ 6 ] for a good overview ) .
Hierarchical agglomerative clustering starts with each paper in a cluster by itself . At each stage the two \closest" clusters are merged . The process is repeated until all papers are in a single cluster .
In the k means algorithm , we begin by randomly placing the n papers into k clusters . We compute the normalized center of gravity of these clusters , then place each paper into its nearest cluster , using the Euclidean distance . We iterate this process , and at each iteration we compute the cost function as the sum of distances of every paper to its cluster ’s center of gravity . We continue the process until the decrease in cost is smaller than a parameter ffi .
The agglomerative algorithm has the disadvantage that it is slow . We discuss our efficient implementation in the next section . However , the algorithm returns a large number of clusters and captures the notion of a hierarchy of communities . Verification techniques based on word frequency and journal and conference proceeding coverage indicate that the clusters obtained by the agglomerative method are more relevant than those from the k means algorithm .
K means is known to be especially prone to getting stuck in local minima near the initial conditions , which suggests that the algorithm would perform poorly at discovering stable communities . Another difficulty with k means is that , given n total nodes in the graph , the algorithm tends to find k communities , all of size approximately n=k . We also found that k means tends to cluster around highly referenced papers and books . Thus , clusters with important papers and books tend to grab any paper that reference them . This is especially problematic for texts on very general topics since it does not make sense to cluster around them . On the other hand , the k means algorithm runs very quickly , and is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms . 5.2 Efficient Agglomerative clustering
In choosing to use an agglomerative approach over kmeans , the first daunting problem is dealing with slow run times . A naive implementation of an agglomerative clustering stategy would at each step calculate all n2 pair wise distances for an overall running time of n3 , where n is the number of nodes in the dataset . However , the nature of our data and the distance measure allows us to speed up this process significantly .
There are two points at which the algorithm can be sped up . First , one can determine the nearest neighbor for each paper without examining all other papers ; second , one does not need to recalculate the nearest neighbor for all papers after a merge , but only those whose nearest neighbor may have been affected by the merge .
For each paper , p , the nearest neighbor is computed as follows . Let dout and din be the number of references and number of citations for an average paper , respectively . The set of references Rp is computed . Using a graph with all edges reversed , the set of papers S that reference one or more papers in Rp is determined . Typically the set S associated with a cluster consisting of a single paper is of size doutdin ( a few hundred ) . All papers outside S have infinite distance to paper p and are ignored in finding the nearest neighbor of p . The initial distance calculation is approximately of order doutdinn , where n is the number nodes in the core . Since the average degrees are very small , this is significantly better than computing all n2 distances . Once the nearest neighbor for each vertex is determined , the pair of closest clusters are merged into a single cluster .
Once a merge occurs , the nearest neighbor information needs to be updated . Suppose communities A and B merged and consider a third community C . For C , only three distances change : dist(A[B ; C ) must be computed ; dist(A ; C ) and dist(B ; C ) are invalid . Using the same process outlined above , we first compute the closest neighbor to the merged community A[B . Call the distance from A[B to its closest neighbor dm . The nearest neighbor of C changes only if that neighbor was A or B or the new neighbor is A[B . Thus , the distance to the nearest neighbor of C is recomputed if the previous nearest neighbor was A or B or the distance to the previous nearest neighbor of C was greater than dm . Note that if the distance of C to its nearest neighbor is already less than or equal to dm , it will keep its current nearest neighbor . The above observations lead to an efficient agglomerative clustering algorithm . In our implementation , we are able to obtain a full agglomerative clustering of the CiteSeer data in under 3 hours .

INSTABILITIES
Agglomerative clustering methods are known to be sensitive to changes in the input data . In this section , we show that the level of instability of agglomerative clustering of our network data is in fact quite dramatic . Later we will exploit such instabilities to identify so called natural communities , which are clusters that remain relatively stable under perturbations of the input .

Table 1 : Instabilities due to randomly removing a single paper out of 250,000 . Note that the effect of the perturbation of the data becomes more pronounced for higher level clusters , ie , the perturbation is amplified when moving up the clustering tree .
We first considered the effect on our agglomerative clustering by removing a single , randomly selected paper . We selected [ 2 ] ; the paper has 33 references and is cited by 2 papers . In order to minimize the impact on the graph , we only removed the out going edges of this node ( ie the references in the paper ) . We kept the two incoming references from the papers that cite this paper . So , in effect , we moved the paper from the core set of 250,000 papers to the set of 1.6 million papers outside the core . This is as if the paper had not been found on line by the CiteSeer crawler . After removing the paper , we ran another agglomerative clustering and found for each cluster in the new tree the best matching cluster in the original tree . The match value associated with 2 clusters C and C 0 is determined using the overlap of papers between C and C 0 . The best match fraction for a community C in tree T to tree T 0 is defined as bestmatch(C ; T 0 ) = max jC \ C 0j jCj
; jC \ C 0j jC 0j
C 0 2T 0  min
In finding the best match of community C in tree T we compare C to every community C 0 in T . Some communities in T , say the root community , entirely contain C . However , these are not necessarily the best match for C since C contains only a small fraction of their papers . Thus we look for a community C 0 that contains a large fraction of C but also one in which C contains a large fraction of C 0 . Thus the best match of C will usually be roughly the same size as C . This is accomplished by the min condition in the equation . Table 1 gives our results . The column labelled \# clust" gives the number of clusters ; \# full" gives the number of clusters such that bestmatch(C ; T 0 ) = 1 ; \match" gives the average bestmatch value as a percentage ; \std" is the stan dard deviation of the average value .
As one might expect , the smaller clusters ( up to size around 100 ) are hardly affected by this change in data . This is because only the distances between papers that share references with the removed paper are affected . In fact , none of the size 2 or size 3 clusters are changed at the bottom of our tree ( compare # clust . with # full ) . Similarly , only a very small fraction of clusters up to size 100 are changed . However , we see that the effect is amplified moving up the tree . Clusters of size 6,000 and up are changed 20 % or more . We also calculated the change in the vector representing the centroid of these clusters and found an average change of around 30 degrees . Figure 1 illustrates our clustering tree and indicates how the centroid of the higher level clusters tilt due to the removal of one paper at the bottom . level 18 cluster size ~ 15,000 level 14 cluster size ~100 level 7

Figure 1 : Instability due to removal a single paper from core set .
Apparently , the removal of the references from a single paper out of 250,000 leads to significant change ( 20 % in the larger clusters ) . It is surprising to find such a large effect . Note that the change at the bottom of the tree is less than 0001 % Perhaps beyond a certain size all communities are close together and merges become arbitrary .
In the next section , we show how such instabilities actually help us find true structure in the underlying network .
7 . NATURAL COMMUNITIES
The instability data suggests a method for discovering stable or natural communities in the CiteSeer citation graph . Based on the previous section , we know that there are communities that remain unchanged under small perturbations . Since we ultimately want to track the evolution of the CiteSeer graph G , we can view timewise changes to G as perturbations of the dataset . Thus , before moving to changes related to time , we randomly perturb G many times to discover stable communities across the multiple clusterings . 7.1 Definition

We choose a root tree T fi 2   and compare T fi to all trees in   , fT fig . Let N T fi be the desired set of natural communities . We call C 2 N natural if in a fraction f of the trees the best match of C has a value greater than some threshold p .

7.2 Results
The choices of parameters p and f are somewhat arbitrary because the notion of \naturalness" of a community depends on your application . If you want to find very strong communities , you would set both parameters near 1 . To select reasonable values for these parameters , we consider the average best match for an arbitrary community as a lower bound . Based on Table 2 we see that average matches are in the high 40 % to low 50 % range . However , we note that communities of size larger than 1000 do not really get beyond 60 % for a best match . So we choose p = 70 % as our cutoff for natural communities of size less than 1000 and p = 60 % for larger communities . Furthermore , a natural community should appear in more than half of all the trees and so we set f = 0:6 . When we filter out just the natural communities from n = 100 runs , we get the data in Table 3 .
The column \nat" gives the number of natural communities ; \match" gives the average best match across all 100 trees ; \unnat" gives the number of other clusters . For most

Table 3 : Average community matchings over 100 trees for natural and unnatural communities . natural communities , the best match is in the range of 70 % to 75 % compared to 45 % to 50 % for the best match of other communities .
When the number of trees n grows large and f is held fixed , we observe that the number of natural communities stabilizes to around 160 out of approximately 3000 clusters containing 100 or more papers . These natural communities form a tree structure that is partially illustrated in Figure 2 . The root node has 16 children most of which have only 100 to 200 papers . These small communities are very sharply defined . The small communities that are children of the root tend to be collections of papers that are not on computer science . For example , there are communities of papers on quantum physics , macroeconomics and finance , and even the Greenland ice sheet . Large communities in the tree are hard to define since they are collections of small , well defined areas . This may explain why the larger communities tend to be slightly less stable than the smaller ones .
This process does not capture all the natural communities embedded in G . Our choice of the base tree T fi was arbitrary , and yet it fixed our vantage point . If a community is natural but happens to not appear in T fi , we will not find it . However , repeating the above process many times with different base trees , and unioning each of the sets of natural communities , would give us a sharper view of the strong structures in the citation graph .
As a further experiment , the k means algorithm was run on the whole graph to determine if any natural communities would emerge . We chose a value of k = 70 , which produced communities of between 2000 and 3000 papers . There were several natural communities in this range found by the agglomerative clustering algorithm , using the parameters as discussed above . Unfortunately , comparing 2 runs of k means revealed that only 3 of the 70 communities had an overlap over 50 % , with only 1 of these communities above 60 % overlap . It was immediately clear that the vanilla kmeans algorithm would not find natural communities .
Finally , we generated a number of random graphs with the same degree structure as G and attempted to find natural communities . To do this , we simply listed the graph edges in two columns ( head and tail ) and randomly permuted the tail column . While this does not maintain certain real world properties like temporal referencing constraints , it is nevertheless an insightful random structure . We wished to verify , at a very crude level , that the natural communities process required some latent structure beyond power law degree distributions to find stability . The results support this : there were no natural communities , and few reasonable matches .
8 . CONCLUSIONS
Our analysis of the CiteSeer citation graph establishes that there is sufficient information hidden in the citation data to extract meaningful higher level structure . Our notion of natural communities allows us to extract a meaningful , stable core set of clusters from a collection of agglomerative clusterings . The agglomerative clustering trees of the CiteSeer data have around 3000 nodes reprenting clusters with more than 100 papers . The vast majority of these clusters are quite unstable and do not provide useful higherlevel information . However , around 160 nodes correspond to coherent natural communities . In [ 8 ] , we track the evolution of these communities over time and show how we can identify the emergence of new sub fields .
There are many avenues for future work . With respect to discovering natural communities , basic k means is certainly unsuccessful . However , more sophisticated k means methods that integrate local search should be explored .
One standard question that should be asked of any clustering algorithm is why we should trust one set of clusters over another . Further validation beyond word frequencybased approaches are needed to validate the clusters ; baselines for algorithmic results are needed on synthetic data like simple temporal network models to verify the clustering procedures .
More generally , most citation based methods treat all citations equally , and this yields the problem of equally weighting very general references to textbooks and references to key papers in the field ( among other problems ) . Integrating context into the citation graph , perhaps via edge weights , could improve clustering results .
