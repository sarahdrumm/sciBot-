ABSTRACT Online auctions are generating a new class of fine grained data about online transactions . This data lends itself to a variety of applications and services that can be provided to both buyers and sellers in online marketplaces . We collect data from online auctions and use several classification algorithms to predict the probable end prices of online auction items . This paper describes the feature extraction and selection process , and several machine learning formulations of the price prediction problem . As a prototype application , we developed Auction Price Insurance that uses the predicted end price to offer price insurance to sellers in online auctions . We define Price Insurance as a service that offers insurance to auction sellers that guarantees a price for their goods , for an appropriate premium . If the item sells for less than the insured price , the seller is reimbursed for the difference . We show that our price prediction techniques are accurate enough to offer price insurance as a profitable business . While this paper deals specifically with online auctions , we believe that this is an interesting case study that applies to dynamic markets where the price of the goods is variable and is affected by both internal and external factors that change over time .

1 . INTRODUCTION Online marketplaces have been gaining in importance for the past few years . EBay , Yahoo! Auctions , Amazon Marketplace and other online marketplaces have become significant commercial entities and according to some estimates , they will account for 25 % of online ecommerce by the end of this year . Today , eBay , one of the largest online marketplaces , consists of 125 million members typically buying and selling 30 million items at any given time . In 2004 , $32 billion of goods were sold on eBay . Although the primary purpose of these marketplaces is commerce , they also offer a new source of data that can be utilized to make inferences about mass economic behavior , product marketing , market research , and provide services to the buyers and sellers participating in the online marketplaces .
This paper was motivated by the idea of providing a new class of service to sellers in online auctions that we call Auction Price Insurance . We define Price Insurance as a service that offers insurance to auction sellers that guarantees a minimum end price for their goods , for an appropriate premium . If the item sells for less than the insured price , the seller is reimbursed for the difference . Individual sellers often do not have a high risk tolerance as evidenced by the large number of sellers using the Reserve Price feature in their auctions . In previous studies , it has been shown that the probability of an auction item selling is lower when Reserve Price is used . This statistic shows that individuals using the Reserve Price are indeed very risk averse and would rather not sell the product than sell it for less than a predetermined amount . They are also willing to pay a small premium to avoid that . Furthermore , since individuals only sell a small number of items , they cannot diversify their risk as large retailers or corporations do . Based on these assumptions , we believe that Price Insurance is a potentially useful service that users of online auctions will be interested in .
In this paper , we describe the data collection , feature extraction and classification algorithms to predict the end prices of online auctions and then use these predicted prices to optimally insure each individual auction for a specific end price . The challenge is that price prediction has to be accurate for the price insurance to be profitable for the insurance provider . Price prediction for auctions is a challenging task for machine learning algorithms mainly because of the large number of attributes that can vary in auction settings . Even items ( of the same kind ) differ in condition : new , almost new , used , working condition , not working . The variance in shipping charges , reliability of sellers , appearance of the listing , beginning and ending times , all are factors that make it difficult to predict the price of an auction . Even if all the above variations were accounted for , there is still the uncertainty in human behavior when bidding on auctions . Auction Software Review [ 1 ] reported that 15 % of the auctions eBay are won in the last minute which gives an indication of the high uncertainty in the end price of a given auction .
The price prediction system described in this paper is trained by using the characteristics of the seller , the item to be auctioned , the features of the auction , and historical auction data to make predictions about the outcome of an auction before it starts . We
411Industry/Government Track Paper describe the features used , the various ways in which price prediction can be formulated as a machine learning problem , and the performance results of several algorithms applied to this task . These results show that we can predict the end prices of auctions very accurately which leads to several applications that can be used to provide new services to the participants in online marketplaces . Using PDAs being auctioned on eBay as an example data set , we show that using price prediction to optimally insure different auctions for different prices results in a profitable business model . Our simulations show that , under certain assumptions that we describe in more detail later on in the paper , a service offering price insurance , only for PDAs , could result in a profit of $1.95 per PDA which adds up to $87000 for an average month . In addition to offering price insurance , the price prediction can also be used to offer a variety of services , such as helping sellers write "optimal" auction item descriptions , optimizing auction parameters ( starting time , duration , starting price , reserve option , etc ) While the problem tackled in this paper is specific to online auctions , we believe that this is an interesting case study that applies to dynamic markets where the price of the goods is variable and is affected by both internal and external factors that change over time . 2 . RELATED WORK There has been a lot of work in the Economics and Data Mining community on analyzing online auctions . Most of this work has focused on describing past auctions rather than prediction . Bajari & Hortascu [ 2 ] develop econometric techniques to build models of bidding behavior . Lucking Riely et al . [ 4 ] use data collected from eBay about auctions of collectible coins to study the factors that affect the price . Although this study is a good exploratory analysis of online auctions , it only finds correlations between attributes of the auction and the resulting price and does not aim to build predictive models .
There has been some work in price prediction of items in online markets eg airlines fares [ 7 ] but not much has been done in the auction domain . The only work we are aware of that involves predicting prices in auctions was done implicitly during the Trading Agent Competition ( TAC ) [ 10,12,13 ] focusing on the travel domain . TAC relies on a simulator of airline , hotel , and ticket prices and the competitors build agents to bid on these . TAC simulates prices and assumes that the supply of products ( airline tickets ) is unlimited . Several TAC competitors have explored a range of methods for price prediction including historical averaging , neural nets , and boosting . All of the work in this domain is performed with artificially generated data and does not use any real auction data . The work in this paper is based on data collected from eBay and is aimed at predicting the prices to provide a new set of services to the buyers and sellers in online marketplaces . As far as we are aware , no previous work has been attempted in the area of Price Insurance for auctions or online marketplaces . 3 . OVERVIEW OF OUR APPROACH At a high level , the initial goal of our work is to predict the ending price of a given auction before the auction starts . For the results presented later in this paper , we specifically deal with eBay auctions but the algorithms and features should generalize to other online auctions . The input to the system is the data that is provided by the seller when listing an item for auction . This includes information about the seller himself , details of the item ( name , specifications , description , photos , etc. ) , and attributes about the auction ( length , starting bid , reserve price , shipping charges , etc ) This information is processed to extract attributes and create new attributes that are then used to predict the probable end price for that auction . The high level steps of our approach are outlined below : 1 . Collect data about auction listings 2 . Define the set of features to be extracted 3 . Create meta features that are derived from the initial set of features 4 . Train a classifier from training data 5 . Use classifier to predict price ( distribution ) for a new auction 6 . Use Insurance Module to select Insurance Price and premium charged . 4 . DATA COLLECTION We constructed a web crawler to visit eBay and extract auction listings for several categories over a period of two months . For a given category , the crawler constructed a search query to find all completed auctions and stored all the pages associated with that auction . This included the page where the auction was listed in the search results , the detailed page for the auction containing the description , photos of the item , the bid history page containing usernames of all bidders , amount and time of all bids , as well as the page listing the feedback for the seller . For further analysis in this paper , we selected the PDA category . Table 1 gives some statistics about PDA auctions that were executed on eBay during February 2004 . 5 . FEATURE EXTRACTION & CONSTRUCTION The data collected by the crawler was then used to extract four classes of features : Seller Features : Including seller feedback score , number of negative ratings , number of months seller has been active on ebay , and other characteristics of the seller as reported by eBay ( power seller , runs a webpage on ebay , etc ) Item Listing Features : Title of Auction , Description of the item , Condition of the item ( new , used , like new ) , eBay Category Item Category Features : These features will depend on the particular category . For PDAs , we included Model , Brand , Manufacturer , Screen size , Screen Type , Memory , and other attributes present in the listing . Auction Features : Starting time , Ending time , Starting bid , Presence of Reserve price , Shipping cost , Stylistic features of the auction ( bold listing , highlighted , Gallery featured , etc . ) Temporal Features The temporal features were based on other auctions in the recent history for the same item . For each auction listing in our data set we extracted the following features : Let Xij be the set of auctions that finished in the j hours preceding the time when auction i started . For each auction item i , we
412Industry/Government Track Paper constructed the set X consisting of sets Xij with j having values 1/3,1/2,1,2,4,6,12,24 , with units of hours . From each set in X , we created new features consisting of the Mean , Standard Deviation , Minimum , Maximum values for the starting bid , shipping price and end price . We also calculate |Xij| , the number of similar items that were listed for auction in the j hours before auction i started and the number of auctions where the item did not sell . More formally , for each auction in our data set , we calculate the crossproduct A x B x C where : A={Mean , Standard Deviation , Minimum , Maximum} ( measures to calculate ) B={Starting Bid , Ending Price , Shipping Charges} ( features to use ) C={1/3,1/2,1,2,4,6,12,24} ( number of hours preceding starting of auction i ) These four classes of features result in a total of approximately 430 features for each instance in our data set . the

6 . PRICE PREDICTION AS A MACHINE LEARNING PROBLEM Given the features described in the previous section , the task now is to predict the end price of a new auction . There are several ways in which this problem can be tackled with machine learning algorithms . We defined the problem in three ways to compare the relative merits of each approach and judge their effectiveness in isolation as well as for offering Price Insurance : Regression : We treat the price prediction task as a regression task and use the training data to learn regression coefficients . The output of the model , when applied to new data is a specific ( continuous ) price . For the results reported in the following then be section , we used linear regression , polynomial regression with degrees 2 and 3 , and CART ( Classification & Regression Trees ) . Multi Class Classification : We discretize the end price ( target variable ) into $51 intervals and create discrete categories . Each instance now falls in one of these categories . The price prediction problem can treated as a multiclass classification problem with the output being a $5 range instead of the specific price ( as in the case of regression ) . We use decision trees ( C5.0 ) and neural networks to implement the multiclass classification in our experiments . Multiple Binary Classification tasks : We create multiple binary classifiers , with each classifier learning a binary classification task : whether the end price of the auction will be more than $X or not . For the experiments in this paper , we varied X in $5 intervals to be comparable to the multiclass approach . For example , one classifier for classifying whether price is more than $5 , the next for $10 , and so on , going up to the maximum price in the training set . This technique was motivated by the small amounts of training examples that are available for any item in online auctions . Although there are a large number of auctions going on , auctions for any single kind of item are limited in number . This creates the need to use the scarce training data in an efficient manner . The multiclass classification scheme ( described earlier ) is not very effective since the positive examples for each category ( $5 interval ) are limited to the ones in that category . In contrast , for the binary classification case with multiple classifiers , the positive examples for the classifier that is predicting whether the price is going to be greater than $45 , consist of all the examples where the price is greater than 45 ( and not just in the range $45 $50 ) . Each classifier has access to the entire training data instead of subsets that the multiclass classifier uses , making it much more effective at using the available training data . Our hypothesis is that this scheme will perform better than the multiclass classification in our evaluation . We use decision trees ( C5.0 ) and Neural Networks to construct each classifier in this scheme . Another advantage of this technique is that the class distribution is not as skewed as it is for Multiclasss Classification . In Multiclass Classification , the positive examples are only instances which fall within a narrow range ( $45 $50 for example ) and the negative examples are the rest of the instances . This creates a much skewed class distribution which makes it a difficult classification problem for standard classification techniques [ 5 ] . By creating multiple binary classes that predict a threshold ( >$45 for example ) , the class distribution is relatively more uniform . Our hypothesis is that this should improve classification accuracy . 7 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS For our experiments , we selected all the auctions that were selling Palm Zire 21 from the PDA category on eBay during a two month period . This resulted in a data set consisting of 1700 instances . The price distribution for these instances is shown in Figure 1 .
1 The interval would vary with different tasks . We picked $5 because the average price of PDAs in our dataset was $55 and we wanted to predict the price within a 10 % window of the average price .
413Industry/Government Track Paper For evaluation , we used 1300 for training the models and the rest of the 400 for testing . The results in Tables 4 and 5 show that all of the methods we use are effective at predicting the end price of auctions . Regression results are not as promising as the ones for classification , mainly because the task is harder since an exact price is being predicted as opposed to a price range . In the future , we plan to narrow the bins for the price range and experiment with using classification algorithms to achieve more fine grained results . Between the two schemes we used for classification ( multiclass classification , and multiple binary classifiers ) , we see dramatic improvement from the second approach . We are able to achieve 96 % accuracy by creating classifiers that learn separate binary classification tasks of predicting whether the price is more than $x for different values of x .

Figure 2 . Results for the Binary Threshold Classifier is decomposed
We believe that the improvement is consistent with our initial hypothesis that this technique utilizes all of the training data available with every classifier instead of being restricted to a particular category and that the uniform class distribution results in better classification results . The idea of learning separate binary classifiers for multiple categories has some similarity to the notion of using Output for multiclass classification where a multiclass Codes classification problem into multiple binary problems with each classifier using all of the available training data [ 6,8 ] . Techniques such as One Per Class ( OPC ) , Pairwise Coupling , and Error Correcting Codes have been used in the past to create these binary problems from multiclass tasks . In our work , we had the added notion of the output class being a price ( continuous variable ) , which allowed us to learn a “ threshold ” in addition to classes that are generally categorical in nature and independent of each other . 8 . PRICE INSURANCE Knowing the end price before an auction starts provides an opportunity for a third party to offer price insurance to sellers . The insurer , knowing the likely ending price for any auction listing before it starts , can charge a premium to insure that the
414Industry/Government Track Paper item will sell for at least the insured price . If the item sells for less than the insured price , the seller is reimbursed for the difference ( between the insured price and the selling price ) by the insurer . Offering Price Insurance consists of two steps : 1 . Selecting the Price ( or range of prices ) to insure an auction item for . 2 . Selecting a premium to charge the seller of the item for the insurance . We envision a variety of strategies for selecting the price to insure auction items . Our goal is not to come up with an optimal strategy to offer price insurance but rather to give the insurance provider all the information required to price the insurance . Our price prediction algorithms output a price distribution for each item and an insurance company can then use their actuarial expertise to price the insurance . We give several sample strategies in order to prove the effectiveness of using the price prediction results from the previous section to offer price insurance . A simple strategy that combines both the price and the premium would be to allow the seller to pick different prices and the premium is changed accordingly . For example , the seller for the item to be insured might be able to select prices ranging from $20 to $80 in $5 intervals and since our price prediction algorithms can give a probability of the item selling for any given price , the premium can be determined accordingly . A second strategy , one that we implement in our prototype , is to select an “ optimal ” price to insure each auction ( depending on the probability given by the price prediction algorithm ) and then calculate the premium based on that probability . Since our goal was to illustrate the feasibility of Price Insurance as a business model and not to come up with an optimal method for doing it , we selected the price and premium using relatively straightforward methods . How do we select the Insured Price ? We use the classification scheme from the last section , training one classifier for each price threshold . Each classifier predicts whether the price for that instance ( auction ) will be greater than $X or not with a certain score/probability . Let ( Xi , Ci , Pi ) be the triple output by classifier i where X is the price that classifier is trained for , C is 1 or 1 signifying whether the classifier predicted the price would be greater than X or not respectively , with probability P . We apply all the classifiers , for different values of X , for each auction and then select the highest price for which the classifier predicted 1 as the price to insure that auction . For example if the classifiers predict ( 40 , 1 , 0.9 ) , ( 45 , 1 , 0.85 ) , and ( 50 , 1 , 0,8 ) , we offer $45 as the insured price for that auction . How do we calculate the Insurance Premium ? Insurance sophisticated Actuarial Mathematics to calculate premiums for insurance based on the risk profile of the item/person being insured . As a first step , we chose a fairly simple technique to come up with insurance premiums in our study . We conducted an informal survey of 10 people and asked them , as potential users of such a service , how much they would pay to insure items at different prices . To keep the questions concrete , we gave them the scenario of selling Palm Zire PDAs and statistics about recent prices ( average , minimum companies use fairly maximum prices for this item in recent auctions ) . We then asked them to give a price they would pay to insure their auction for Palm Zire at different prices , ranging from $40 to $80 , in $5 intervals . The average results of the informal survey are given in Table 4 and are the premiums we use in the next section to simulate Price Insurance results .

8.1 Evaluation of Price Insurance For every auction in the test set ( 400 auctions ) , we use the price prediction algorithms described earlier in the paper to first predict the probable end price and then simulate offering Price Insurance for it . Each auction item can then be potentially insured at a different price , based on the output of the price prediction algorithm . We compare our approach to a technique that insures all auctions of the same item at the same price . 811 Fixed Price Insurance Baseline The baseline technique uses the cumulative price distribution ( Figure 3 ) to select the price which x % of the items did not exceed . For example , picking 80 % on the y axis tells us that 80 % of the items sold for less than $65 and that insuring every item for $65 will result in 80 % ( on average ) of the insurances being successful and 20 % would result in losses for the insurance provider . We pick different values of x as our baseline techniques ( fixed price insurance ) to compare with our approach for selecting a different price to insure every auction based on our price prediction algorithm . 812 Auction Price Insurance “ Simulation ” For each technique , we take the auctions in our test set ( unseen by the price prediction algorithm ) and select the insured price for that auction . For fixed price insurance , it is the price chosen by the percentile in the cumulative distribution , and for the Price prediction technique , it is chosen according to the description in the previous section . We then look at the actual ending price of

If the auction item sold for more than the price that it was “ insured ” for ( in our simulation ) , we consider it as a successful it is considered a “ Bad ” insurance ( labeled as Claims in the results table ) since the insurance provider would incur losses . We also assume some processing cost associated with a “ Bad ” insurance since a claim would be filed , , and the seller would have to reimbursed for the difference . We use a parameter C ( currently set to $5 ) to account for the processing cost for each “ claim ” ( or bad insurance ) . The profit for the Insurance Provider is then the revenue generated from all the premiums paid by the sellers using the service minus the insurances .

Claims where Bi = 0 if Insured Price <= Actual Price , and 1 otherwise . The results of our simulation comparing the different approaches are given in Table 5 . Net Revenue is calculated by subtracting the Losses from the Gross Revenue . We use $5 as our Claims processing cost per claim for the current set of experiments . Selecting a low price for Fixed Price Insurance model results in few “ Claims ” but the revenue is also greatly reduced since we’re insuring items to sell for a low price and people will not generally pay much for that service . As we can see from Table 5 , insuring every item for $40 results in a profitable service , but only generating an average of $0.36 per insured item . For higher price Fixed Price Insurance , the probability of items selling for a lower price is much higher and results in losses . Selecting $60 results in almost $5 being lost for every insured item . We stop at $60 for the Fixed Price since the results consistently keep getting worse ( with more money being lost ) as the insured price increases . In contrast , the price prediction technique potentially insuring every item for a different price results in an extremely profitable system . Of the 398 auction items insured , only 5 turn out to be Claims , resulting in a profit of almost $2 per insured item . Figure 4 shows the Insured Price Distribution and the Actual End Price Distribution for the items in our test set . Online auction providers are often known to add services that can result in higher revenue for them , usually on the order of cents per auction item . This results in a large revenue increase due to the sheer volume of auctions being hosted . eBay , for example , has 125 million auctions running at any given time , and incremental revenues of a few cents for each auction would result in a large revenue increase . As seen in Table 1 , around 45000 PDA auctions took place on eBay for February 2004 . Our results , for the 398 items in our test set , show that an average of $1.95 can be gained by a service offering price insurance . Extrapolated to a month of selling just PDAs results in potential revenues of $87000/month . We have not done experiments with other categories but it seems reasonable to expect that this technique applies to other items as well . The exact accuracy of the system will vary but any service offering insurance for PDAs can also offer the same kind of service for other products . Since there are a lot of assumptions involved in the revenues reported in Table 5 and there will be some variance in any of those assumptions ( % of sellers using this kind of service , change in premiums , variance due to different categories of products , etc. ) , the exact revenue will vary but the idea of offering price insurance would be profitable given some level of accuracy of the price prediction algorithms . 9 . OTHER APPLICATIONS The ability to predict the ending price of online auction items lends itself to a variety of applications . We described Auction Price Insurance as one of those applications in the previous section . Here , we briefly describe some other possible applications of the same technique . Listing Optimizer : The model of the end price based on the input attributes of the auction can also be used to help sellers optimize the selling price of their items . When the seller enters their personal information and the item they want to sell in an auction , a service could give suggestions for the auction attributes ( such as starting time , starting bid , use of photos , reserve price , words to describe the item , etc . ) that would maximize the endprice . Auction Arbitrage : Instead of offering Price Insurance , Price Prediction can be used to do arbitrage in online auctions . If an item is being sold for much lower than the expected selling price due to some parameter of the auction that can be changed by the seller , the item can be acquired at the low price and then re listed using optimal or better auction parameters ( better ending time , duration , description , highlighting , etc . ) to sell for a higher price . There are several other applications that can be enabled by the price prediction techniques described in this paper . While we have not provided an exhaustive list of applications , we believe that having access to the likely end price of auction items opens up a large variety of services that can be offered to both buyers and sellers in online auctions .
416Industry/Government Track Paper 10 . Conclusions and Future Work We described our work on a system capable of predicting the endprice of online auctions . The system requires the information provided by the seller of an item and uses machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the end price . We find that among a variety of problem formulations , posing price prediction as a series of binary classification problems with each predicting a threshold is best suited for this task . We also show that using these price predictions to offer Price Insurance for online auctions can be a successful business outperforming a fixed price insurance technique . There are several ways to extend the applicability of our approach and explore alternative methods . In this paper , we use PDAs because they can be described and compared using “ hard ” features/specifications ( e.g memory size , speed , screen type , operating system ) . In contrast , “ soft ” products such as clothing items don’t have the same kinds of attributes that can be used to compare different kinds of items . Features such as size , material and color do exist but they are not the kind of attributes that “ define ” the style of the product . To apply the algorithms in that context , we can use ideas described in some earlier work [ 9 ] to first extract product attributes from free text descriptions of products available online ( in stores or auction websites ) , and then use these attributes as part of the learning process . This would extend the applicability of our approach to “ soft ” products such as apparel , fashion items , antiques , and collectibles .
In this paper , we only used data from auctions that were about the same item . We encoded the context by using temporal features that described past auctions that were “ similar ” to the one that was being studied . Another direction that we intend to follow is to use data about auctions that are not related to the current item . This is similar to work done in machine learning from learning with unlabeled data [ 3,11 ] where the unlabeled data implicitly provides background knowledge and correlations between attributes that are not directly related , but useful for the classification task . Since there is data available for auctions in general which can be collected fairly cheaply , it would be valuable to study and develop techniques that can learn general patterns about auctions to make inferences about specific auctions .
