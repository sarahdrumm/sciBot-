ABSTRACT Integrating information in multiple natural languages is a challenging task that often requires manually created linguistic resources such as a bilingual dictionary or examples of direct translations of text . In this paper , we propose a general cross lingual text mining method that does not rely on any of these resources , but can exploit comparable bilingual text corpora to discover mappings between words and documents in different languages . Comparable text corpora are collections of text documents in different languages that are about similar topics ; such text corpora are often naturally available ( eg , news articles in different languages published in the same time period ) . The main idea of our method is to exploit frequency correlations of words in different languages in the comparable corpora and discover mappings between words in different languages . Such mappings can then be used to further discover mappings between documents in different languages , achieving cross lingual information integration . Evaluation of the proposed method on a 120MB Chinese English comparable news collection shows that the proposed method is effective for mapping words and documents in English and Chinese . Since our method only relies on naturally available comparable corpora , it is generally applicable to any language pairs as long as we have comparable corpora .

INTRODUCTION
As more information becomes available online , we have also seen more and more information in different natural languages such as English , Spanish , and Chinese . The web today consists of documents in many different languages . For a user who is interested in finding information from all the documents in different languages , it would be very useful if we could integrate related information in multiple languages [ 1 ] .
Currently , cross lingual information integration is often achieved through performing cross lingual information retrieval(CLIR ) [ 17 ] , which allows a user to retrieve documents in language A with a query in language B . Most CLIR techniques rely on manually created linguistic resources such as a bilingual dictionary or examples of direct translations of words and documents [ 16 ] . Such resources may not always be available , especially for minority languages ; in such a case , how to perform cross lingual information integration would be a significant challenge . In this paper , we propose a cross lingual text mining method that can exploit comparable bilingual text corpora to perform cross lingual information integration without requiring any additional linguistic resources .
Comparable text corpora are collections of text documents in different languages that are about the same or similar topics . For example , news articles published in the same time period tend to report the same important international events in various topics such as politics , business , science and sports . Such data are naturally available to us , so it would be very interesting to study how to exploit them to perform cross lingual information integration . Even when we have manually created clean bilingual resources such as a bilingual dictionary , it may still be desirable to exploit such comparable corpora for two reasons : ( 1 ) New words and phrases are constantly introduced and it would be hard to keep updating a dictionary to include them all . Approaches such as what we propose in this paper can potentially be used to acquire translation knowledge about such new words/phrases from comparable corpora and help lexicographers update dictionaries . ( 2 ) Since comparable corpora are additional resources , we may expect to achieve better performance by combining the exploitation of comparable corpora with that of a bilingual dictionary .
We frame the problem of cross lingual information integration as one involving mapping or linking words and documents in different languages . While comparable corpora have been studied extensively in the existing literature ( eg,[6 , 10 , 15 , 5 , 2 , 8 , 13] ) , almost all existing work assumes some kind of bilingual dictionary or translation examples to start with . We study how to map words and documents from comparable bilingual corpora without requiring any additional linguistic resources such as a bilingual dictionary .
Our basic idea is to exploit the fact that the frequency distributions of topically related words in different languages are often correlated due to the correlated coverage of the same events . For example , the earthquake and sea surge disaster that happened recently in Asia has been covered in the news articles in many different languages . We can thus expect to see a recent peak of words such as \earthquake" , \India" , and \Indonesia" in news articles published in multiple languages . In general , we can expect that topically related words in different languages tend to co occur together over time . Thus if we have available comparable news articles over a sufficiently long time period , it is intuitively possible to exploit such correlations to learn the associations of words in different languages .
The general idea of exploiting frequency correlations to acquire word translations from comparable corpora has already been explored in several previous studies ( eg , [ 6 , 10 , 15] ) . However , none of them has adopted a direct comparison of frequency distributions of candidate words as we do ; rather they tend to compute the associations between the words in the same language and then compare association patterns in two different languages . Our idea and the overall approach appear to be more similar to the method used in [ 7 ] , but there the task is aligning sentences in parallel corpora .
With the word mappings , we can then try to match documents in two different languages based on how well the words in each document are correlated . We propose four different methods for computing cross lingual document similarity , including a baseline expected correlation method , an IDF weighted correlation method , a TF IDF method , and a translation model method . These methods allow us to perform cross lingual document retrieval as well as linking the most strongly correlated documents together .
We evaluated our methods on a 120MB Chinese English news report corpus for both word association mining and document association mining . The results show that our method can discover meaningful word mappings and can generate meaningful document alignments for information integration . The top ranked word pairs show various kinds of interesting associations between words in the two different languages . The document alignment results have a high precision of 0.8 at a cutoff of 100 , meaning that 80 % of the document pairs among the top 100 matching results are correctly matched .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows .
In Section 2 , we discuss our data set . In Section 3 and Section 4 , we present our methods for word association mining and document association mining respectively . The experiment results are reported in Section 5 , and we summarize our work in Section 6 .
2 . DATA SET
The comparable corpora we experiment with are 6 months’ of news articles of Xinghua English and Chinese newswires dated from June 8 , 2001 through November 7 , 2001 . There are altogether 43488 documents in Chinese and 34751 documents in English . The average document length is 204.6 words . In this data set , there are many articles in English that have some comparable Chinese articles .
An example of comparable news articles is given in Figure 1 the same international swimming championship in English and Chinese , respectively . While these two articles are from the same newswire source , and they cover the same event , they are not translations of each other .
However , some words in the two articles are clearly translations of each other . For example , the Chinese translations of \swimming" , \World Swimming Championships" , and \Men ’s 400M Freestyle Heats" all occur in the Chinese document . ( They are underlined . )

3 . MINING CROSS LINGUAL WORD AS
SOCIATIONS
In this section , we present our method for mining crosslingual word associations . Our main idea is based on the observation that words that are translations of each other or about the same topic , tend to co occur in the comparable corpora at the same/similar time periods . Thus if we have some large comparable corpora available , it is intuitively possible to exploit such correlations to learn the associations of words in different languages .
To see if our intuition can be supported empirically , in Figure 2 , we compare the frequency distribution ( over time ) of Megawati with that of its Chinese tranlation \LNMNONP
" ( left ) and with that of another randomly chosen Chinese name ( \Arafat" ) ( right ) . We see that the distributions of the English \Megawati" and its Chinese translation indeed look very similar with a high correlation of 0.855 , while the distributions of \Megawati" and the Chinese translation of \Arafat" are quite different with a correlation of only 00324 These plots show that we can indeed expect to find semantically relevant mappings between words in different languages by exploiting frequency correlations . We can thus represent each word with a frequency vector and score each candidate pair of words ( in different languages ) by the similarity of the two frequency vectors .
Formally , suppose we have available comparable corpora C = f(s1 ; t1 ) ; :: : ; ( sn ; tn)g , where si and ti are a set of documents associated with an anchor point of \i" in language A and language B , respectively . Let x ( or y ) be a source ( target ) word in language A and language B , respectively . We use c(x ; si ) ( or c(y ; ti ) ) to denote the counts of x ( or y ) in si ( or ti ) . The raw frequency vectors for x and y are thus ( c(x ; s1 ) ; :: : ; c(x ; sn ) ) and ( c(y ; t1 ) ; :: : ; c(y ; tn) ) , respectively . In order to make the frequency vectors more comparable across different languages , it is desirable to normalize a raw frequency vector so that it becomes a frequency distribution

Figure 2 : Megawati vs . its Chinese translatioin ( left ) and a random Chinese name ( Arafat ) ( right ) . over all the time points . That is , we divide all the counts by the sum of all the counts over the entire time period . Such a normalized frequency distribution would allow us to focus on the relative frequency on different days , which is presumably more comparable across different languages than the original non normalized counts .
Let ~x = ( x1 ; :: : ; xn ) and ~y = ( y1 ; :: : ; yn ) be the normalized frequency vectors for x and y , respectively , where xi = c(x ; si ) j=1 c(x ; sj )
Pn yi = c(y ; ti ) j=1 c(y ; tj )
Pn
In order to compute the similarity between ~x and ~y ( or word x and word y ) , we use the Pearson ’s correlation coefficient , which is a commonly used statistic measure defined as r(x ; y ) = q(Pn i=1 x2
Pn i , 1 i=1 xiyi , 1 n ( Pn i=1 xi)2)(Pn
N Pn i=1 xi Pn i=1 y2 i=1 yi i , 1 n ( Pn i=1 yi)2 )
Using this correlation similarity measure , we can score every word in language A against every word in language B to obtain a matrix of correlations . Such word level mappings can support a user to retrieve words in language A with a word in language B , providing some limited support of navigation across languages . Moreover , the mappings can also be used to discover matched documents between the two languages , which we discuss below .
4 . MINING CROSS LINGUAL DOCUMENT
ASSOCIATIONS
We can score how well a document d1 in language A matches a document d2 in language B by computing a similarity score s(d1 ; d2 ) based on how strongly correlated the words in d1 and those in d2 are . Technically , many different methods are possible . A natural baseline method is to compute the expected correlation between any word in d1 and any word in d2 , ie , s(d1 ; d2 ) = X r(x ; y)p(xjd1)p(yjd2 ) x2d1;y2d2
= X r(x ; y ) x2d1;y2d2 c(x ; d1 ) c(y ; d2 ) jd1j jd2j jd1j and jd2j are the lengths of d1 and d2 , respectively . We call this method Expected Correlation ( ExpCorr ) . Clearly , ExpCorr assigns a weight to every matching word pair based on the corresponding correlation and penalizes long documents due to the naturally high chances of matching , which are both reasonable .
One deficiency of ExpCorr , however , is that it does not distinguish a common word ( eg , \sport" ) from a more discriminative word ( eg , \swimming" ) . Intuitively , matching a common word is a weaker evidence for content matching between the two documents than matching a more discriminative word . A commonly used heuristic in information retrieval is to assign an Inverse Document Frequency ( IDF ) weight to each word , which penalizes popular ( thus noninformative ) words [ 14 ] . In our case , we associate an IDF weight for a matching pair ( x ; y ) , which is defined as
IDF ( x ; y ) = IDF ( x)IDF ( y ) ; where IDF ( w ) = log n+1 df ( w ) , and df ( w ) is the number of documents in a language that contains word w , often called the document frequency of a word .
Adding IDF weighting to ExpCorr , we obtain the follow ing IDF weighted Correlation method ( IDFCorr ) : s(d1 ; d2 ) = X x2d1 ;y2d2
IDF ( x ; y)r(x ; y ) c(x ; d1 ) c(y ; d2 ) jd1j jd2j
In both ExpCorr and IDFCorr , the similarity score grows linearly to the count of a word in the document . However , intuitively , having one extra match after matching a word 100 times does not add so much extra evidence as matching the word the first time . We thus would like to have the similarity score to grow sub linearly according to the count of a matching word . Again , in information retrieval , many formulas have been proposed to heuristically normalize the count of words to achieve this effect . A popular and effective method is the BM25 term frequency normalization method [ 11 , 12 ] . According to this formula , the normalized count of word w in document d is given by
BM 25(w ; d ) = k1c(w ; d ) c(w ; d ) + k1(1 , b + b jdj
AvgDocLen ) where k1 and b are parameters and AvgDocLen is the average document length . In our experiments , we set k1 = 1:2 and b = 0:75 , which are the recommended default settings . The BM25 weighting formula provides an alternative way of normalizing the count of a word , so BM 25(x ; d1 ) and BM 25(y ; d2 ) can effectively play the same role as p(xjd1 ) and p(yjd2 ) , possibly with more reasonably normalization of the counts . Thus we use BM 25(x ; d1 ) and BM 25(y ; d2 ) to replace p(xjd1 ) and p(yjd2 ) , respectively , in the IDFCorr approach to obtain the following formula , which we refer to as BM25 Correlation ( BM25Corr ) . s(d1 ; d2 ) = X x2d1 ;y2d2
IDF ( x ; y)r(x ; y)BM 25(x ; d1)BM 25(y ; d2 )
Finally , motivated by the language modeling approach to information retrieval [ 9 , 17 ] , we can also use the correlation between words to estimate a word translation model t(xjy ) [ 3 ] as t(xjy ) = r(x;y ) Px0 r(x0;y ) . With this translation model , we can define the similarity between d1 and d2 as the likelihood of \generating" d1 with a model based on d2 . That is , s(d1 ; d2 ) = X x2d1 = X x2d1 c(x ; d1 ) log p(xjd2 ) c(x ; d1)[(1 , ) X p(yjd2)t(xjy ) + p(xjC ) ] y where is a smoothing parameter to introduce a background language model p(xjC ) for modeling the noise ( common words ) in d1 and p(yjd2 ) is the relative frequency of word y in d2 , ie , p(yjd2 ) = c(y;d2 ) [ 18 , 19 ] . p(xjC ) can be estimated as p(xjC ) = Pn i=1 c(x;si ) i=1 c(x0;si ) . We refer this one as Px0 Pn CorrTrans . jd2
5 . EXPERIMENTS
We use the data set described in Section 2 to evaluate the proposed word and document mapping methods . The documents published on the same day are aligned together ; there are altogether 148 days . In order to support efficient computation of word correlations , we use the Lemur toolkit to index all the documents in the comparable corpora . 5.1 Mining word associations
Ideally , we can compute the correlation between every word in English and every word in Chinese . However , this involves a huge number of combinations . Since not all words are interesting to match ( eg , common functional words are not interesting for the purpose of information integration ) , we use the following heuristics to significantly reduce the space . 1 . We first compute the entropy [ 4 ] of a word in each language using the formula H(w ) = , Pt p(tjw ) log p(tjw ) , where p(tjw ) is the normalized frequency of word w at time point t ( ie , a day ) . 2 . We then filter out the high entropy words . These are usually frequent words as they tend to occur in everyday ’s news articles . The highest entropy is log(148 ) , which is about 5 , and we used a cutoff of 4:8 . 3 . We further filter out those words with an overall low frequency with a cutoff of 10 . These words are rare , so their correlations may not be reliable .
In Table 1 , we show the top 38 pairs with the highest correlations in the whole corpora along with their correlations , most of which are extremely high quality matchings . Many numbers are correctly aligned based on the dates in the news articles in the two different languages . There are also some direct translations of months , such as \august" vs . 8 . They are clearly learned from the month information in the news articles ; in Chinese news articles , August is written

Table 1 : 38 highest correlated word pairs with the number 8 . The character matching \afghan" and \afghanistan" is one of the three characters in the Chinese translation of \Afghanistan" ( ie ) . The character matching \swimming" is also precisely its Chinese translation , and the top two characters returned for \terror" are the exact translation of this word in Chinese ( ie ) . Another interesting example is the matching of \APEC" and \apec" . Interestingly , from this list , we can also infer that the two major common themes in this corpora appear to be sports and terrorism since the best matching words seem to fall into these two categories . This is an additional benefit of our word association mining algorithm .

Table 2 : The 10 Chinese characters most correlated with \swimming" in English
In Table 2 , we show the top 10 Chinese characters associated with the English word \swimming" along with their meanings in English . We see that almost all the top 10 characters are all closely related to the swimming activities . Naturally , as we go down the ranking list , the quality of matching gradually decreases . 5.2 Mining document associations
From the obtained word correlations , we select the pairs with a correlation larger than 0.6 , and use these relatively more reliable correlations to match documents between the two languages . To evaluate the results quantitatively , we select a sample of representative topics from English by performing word clustering using the simple mixture model presented in [ 20 ] . We generated 30 clusters in this way .

)
We then take the top 5 English documents from the three randomly chosen clusters , to generate 15 seed English documents . For each English document , we use the baseline method ExpCorr to score all the Chinese documents of the same day , the previous day , and the day after , and retrieve top 20 Chinese documents for each English document . We read these documents and judge whether they are about the same topic/theme as the English seed document . The pairs judged as covering the same topic are assumed to be correct mappings . The seed English documents and the retrieved Chinese documents are combined together to form a working set of documents in both languages , which contains 15 English documents and 239 Chinese documents . We then use all the four methods to compute the matching scores of all the seed English documents and all the Chinese documents in the working set , and take the 20 top ranked Chinese documents for each English seed document for evaluation . This way , we can compare the performances of these four methods with a controlled sample of the top ranked pairs from the whole corpora . i i n o s c e r p

Table 3 : Precision at ranks on the working set .
In Figure 3 and Table 3 , we show the precisions at different ranks on the working set for the four methods . We see that the baseline method ExpCorr performs the worst , while BM25Corr performs the best . A comparison between ExpCorr and IDFCorr shows that the incorporation of IDF weighting significantly improves the performance . A comparison between IDFCorr and BM25Corr indicates that the sublinear normalization of TF using BM25 helps further improve the front end precision . The translation model method CorrTrans performs better than the baseline but substantially worse than both IDFCorr and BM25Corr . We note that both IDFCorr and BM25Corr show roughly a monotonically decreasing curve , suggesting that the measures capture the semantic correlation between documents and a high score generally indicates a more accurate matching . However , ExpCorr and CorrTrans both show slightly improved precision at the tail , suggesting that the measures are not quite accurate . Indeed , for ExpCorr , quite a few top ranked pairs are non relevant . The precisions of both
IDFCorr and BM25Corr are as high as 0.8 even at a cutoff of 100 , meaning that among the top 100 pairs , 80 % of them are correct matchings .

Table 4 : Precisions at ranks on the augmented set
In order to understand how much bias the working set might introduce , for each English seed document , we further rank all the Chinese documents from the same day as the English seed document , the day before , and the day after . This time , we take the top 50 Chinese documents for each English seed document and pool them together for evaluation . The results are shown in Figure 4 and Table 4 . Note that because we have not judged all these Chinese documents , we assumed any matching with an unjudged document to be incorrect . This means that the performance we see actually represents a lower bound ; the real performance can only be better .
Comparing Table 3 and Table 4 indicates that the baseline ExpCorr performs similarly , indicating that the additional 30 Chinese documents retrieved mostly have not made to the top pairs . The slight decrease in the precision at rank 50 and rank 100 suggests that there may be a couple unjudged Chinese documents showing up in the top 100 list . Note that , for the baseline method , these 30 Chinese documents are unjudged , thus can only decrease performance . The BM25Corr method also performs similarly ; actually its performance on the larger set is even slightly better at rank 50 and 100 . This suggests that the additional 30 Chinese documents retrieved may actually contain some correct matchings . Note that , in this case , the additional 30 Chinese documents may contain judged correct matchings , which are those documents that are among the top 20 documents returned using the baseline method , but failed to make to the top 20 documents by the BM25Corr method . Thus giving the BM25Corr method an opportunity to retrieve more results has helped it to improve the performance slightly .
Both IDFCorr and CorrTrans perform worse on the larger set , indicating that they are not very robust . Indeed , the precision of CorrTrans is all zeros for all the ranks . This suggests that the method cannot normalize the scores for different English seed document well ; as a result , some in correct results in the additional 30 Chinese documents may have turned out to dominate the top pairs .
Comparing the four methods on ranking the augmented working set , we see that both IDFCorr and BM25Corr again perform better than the other two methods , and BM25Corr is clearly the best method among the four .
6 . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper , we propose and explore a completely unsupervised cross lingual text mining method that can exploit comparable bilingual corpora to perform cross lingual information integration . Our basic idea is to exploit the frequency correlations of words about the same topic to first mine word associations and then mine document associations . These associations can be used to integrate multilingual text information and support cross lingual information retrieval and navigation , which has been becoming more and more important due to the rapid growth of multilingual documents available on the Web . Evaluation of the proposed method on a 120MB Chinese English comparable news collection shows that the proposed method is effective for mapping words and documents in English and Chinese .
The most important contribution of our work is that we have demonstrated the feasibility of mining word and document associations from comparable corpora without relying on any additional ( manually created ) linguistic resources . To the best of our knowledge , all previous attempts on cross lingual information integration rely on some manually crafted linguistics resources such as a bilingual dictionary or translation examples . Since our approach does not depend on such resources , it is more general and robust than the existing methods .
Although we have shown promising results with our methods , our methods can be further improved in several ways . First , we could use the document matching results to induce new alignments for the whole corpora , which can then be used to improve our computation of word correlations . The new results of word correlations can be fed back to help generate improved document alignment . This way , we have an iterative algorithm for mining both word associations and document associations . Second , we have treated the whole document as an information unit . To improve information integration accuracy , it may be beneficial to alignment document segments . For example , we can use a sliding window to search for the best matching segments when matching two documents . Finally , it would be very interesting to explore how to design a mixture model that can mine word associations and document associations simultaneously .
