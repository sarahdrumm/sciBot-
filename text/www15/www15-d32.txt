ABSTRACT Information diffusion in online social networks is obviously affected by the underlying network topology , but it also has the power to change that topology . Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources , and in turn these links are alternating the route of information spread . However , these two highly intertwined stochastic processes , information diffusion and network evolution , have been predominantly studied separately , ignoring their co evolutionary dynamics .
In this project , we propose a probabilistic generative model , COEVOLVE , for the joint dynamics of these two processes , allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other . This model allows us to efficiently simulate diffusion and network events from the co evolutionary dynamics , and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real world networks . Furthermore , we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces . We experimented with both synthetic data and data gathered from Twitter , and show that our model provides a good fit to the data as well as more accurate predictions than alternatives .

INTRODUCTION
Users in social networks often forward to their followers information they are exposed to via their followees , triggering the emergence of information cascades that travel through the network . Besides these dynamic processes on the network , the network topology itself often undergoes dynamic changes , since online users are constantly creating new links to information sources .

( b ) New links create new paths for information diffusion
( a ) Information diffusion creates new links Figure 1 : Joint Dynamics . Blue links form the diffusion paths . Green and blue circles are nodes which see the information . Green circles are those who re share and propagate the information . Red circles are nodes unaware of A ’s post .
While there have been many recent works on modeling information diffusion and network evolution , most of them treat these two stochastic processes independently and separately , ignoring the influence one may have on the other over time . However , recent empirical studies have been able to overlay these two sources of data , and show that both processes are indeed coupled and network changes are often triggered by information diffusion [ 5 , 1 , 4 ] .
We propose a probabilistic generative model for the joint dynamics of information diffusion and network evolution . The model consists of two interwoven components , illustrated in Figure 1 .
I . Information diffusion model . We design an “ identity revealing ” multivariate Hawkes process [ 3 ] to capture the mutual excitation behavior of retweeting events , where the intensity of such event in a user is boosted by an aggregation of events from her followees . Although Hawkes processes have been used for information diffusion before [ 2 ] , a major improvement of our approach is that we explicitly model the excitation due to a particular source node .
II . Network evolution model . We model link creation as an “ information driven ” survival process , and couple the intensity of this process with retweeting events .
2 . MODEL
We will model the generation of two types of events : tweet/retweet events , er , and link creation events , el . We represent the events as ( 1 ) er or el source# s ;
) :
:= ( u" ; destination t" time
For retweet event , the triplet means that the destination node u retweets at time t a tweet originally posted by source node s . This event can happen when u is retweeting a message by another ′ node u where the original information source s is acknowledged .

Given a list of retweet events fer the history Hr fer i = ( ui ; si ; ti)jui = u and si = sg : For link creation event , the triplet means that destination node u creates at time t a link to source node s , ie , from time t on , node u starts following node s . We restrict ourselves to the case where each ( directed ) link is created only once . We denote the link creation history as Hl(t ) . Given m users , we will use two sets of counting processes to record the generated events . ffl Counting processes for retweets are denoted as a matrix N ( t ) of size m . m for each fixed time point t . The ( u ; s)th entry in the matrix , Nus(t ) 2 f0g[Z+ , counts the number of retweets of u due to source s up to time t . These counting processes are “ identity revealing" . ffl Survival processes for links are denoted also as a matrix A(t ) of size m . m for each fixed time point t . The ( u ; s) th entry in the matrix , Aus(t ) 2 f0 ; 1g , indicates whether u is directly following s . That is Aus(t ) = 1 means the directed link has been created before t . We do not allow self links .
We will denote matrices dN ( t ) := ( dNus(t ) )u;s2[m ] and sim ilarly dA(t ) := ( dAus(t ) )u;s2[m ] .
!(t ) ⋆ dN ( t ) := ( !(t ) ⋆ dNus(t ) )u;s2[m ] A(t ) ◦ dN ( t ) := ( Aus(t ) dNus(t ) )u;s2[m ]
These operate elementwisely . Furthermore , we can also carry out matrix multiplication operation on A(t ) and dN ( t ) . For instance , : Then the A(t ) dN ( t ) := interwoven information diffusion and network evolution processes can be characterized using their respective intensities w2[m ] Auw(t ) dNws(t ) u;s2[m ]

3 . EXPERIMENTS Degree Distribution . Empirical studies have shown that the degree distribution of social networks and microblogging sites follow a power law , and argued that it is a consequence of the rich get richer phenomena . Intuitively , the higher the values of the parameters ff and fi , the closer the resulting degree distribution follows a power law ; the lower their values , the closer the distribution to an Erdos Renyi graph . Figure 2 confirms this intuition via the degree distribution for different values of fi . Cascade Patterns . Figure 3 summarize the cascade size and depth with varying ff . The higher the ff value , the shallower and wider the cascades . Link and Activity Prediction . We summarize the results in Fig 4 , where we consider an increasing number of training retweet/tweet for training . Our model outperforms all other link prediction and activity prediction methods consistently . References [ 1 ] D . Antoniades and C . Dovrolis .
