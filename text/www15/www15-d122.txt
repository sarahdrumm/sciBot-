ABSTRACT Analysing the representation of gender in news media has a long history within the fields of journalism , media and communication . Typically this can be performed by measuring how often people of each gender are mentioned within the textual content of news articles . In this paper , we adopt a different approach , classifying the faces in images of news articles into their respective gender . We present a study on 885,573 news articles gathered from the web , covering a period of four months between 19th October 2014 and 19th January 2015 from 882 news outlets . Findings show that gender bias differs by topic , with Fashion and the Arts showing the least bias . Comparisons of gender bias by outlet suggest that tabloid style news outlets may be less genderbiased than broadsheet style ones , supporting previous results from textual content analysis of news articles .

INTRODUCTION
It is well known that news media influences public opinion [ 15 , 16 , 17 ] , and considerable attention has been paid by social scientists to the detection of any biases in news reporting . One of the most studied ones is bias in gender representation : how many males and females are represented in the news narrative , and how does this representation change by topic , by outlet or by country .

Traditionally , both text and image analysis have been performed by hand [ 3 , 14 , 18 ] , but in recent times the detection of gender bias in text has been automated [ 1 , 6 ] , making it possible to analyse hundreds of thousands of news articles , from hundreds of different news outlets , over a period of months . This revealed a strong pattern of male over representation , which is however strongly dependent on topic : Entertainment being less skewed than Politics , in the representation of genders . Interestingly , those patterns were correlated with analogous differences in income inequality between the genders .
Now we provide a large scale study of gender bias in the images used by the news media . This involves using face detection and classification tools , which have now reached very high levels of performance even for images taken under uncontrolled conditions , such as those that are found in the news . We discover again a pattern of male overrepresentation in the media , but with interesting variations by topic and type of newspaper .
Previous studies on text from news media found that in a collection of British and Irish news from the Global Media Monitoring Project [ 14 ] , males are three times more visible than females [ 18 ] and that within particular outlets ( CNN , FOX , New York Times ) males are more dominant in their number of mentions [ 3 ] . Our own studies on gender bias in news media text found that gender bias correlates with topic and choice of news outlet [ 1 , 6 ] , with males being far more common in Sports , Politics and Business , while Fashion and Arts are less gender bias .
This paper will briefly describe the infrastructure for the detection and analysis of articles in news articles , as well as their topic . We will not discuss in detail the technology for image classification ( which is described elsewhere , and beyond the scope of this paper ) , but we will provide experimental measurements on the performance of our face gender classifier , benchmarking it on the standard dataset for face gender recognition : LFW , specifically created to represent images of people ’s faces taken in uncontrolled conditions [ 8 ] . Our study involves : 460,493 images from 885,573 articles , published by 882 news outlets , all in English language , gathered in the period from 19th October 2014 to 19th January 2015 .
2 . METHODOLOGY
We gathered 885,573 news articles from the web between 19th October 2014 and 19th January 2015 using our modular architecture for news media analysis [ 5 , 7 ] . Previously , this system has been successfully used for several media anal

News articles were collected from the main RSS feed of 882 news outlets , filtering out any articles which were not written in English . As part of the system , we automatically classified each news article into 15 different generic news categories , such as “ Crime ” or “ Science ” using Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) [ 4 ] trained for high precision on the New York Times [ 19 ] and Reuters corpora [ 13 ] along with online linear perceptron models [ 4 ] trained on news media within our modular architecture . A total of 521,108 articles were assigned to at least one topic category , with topic categories being non exclusive .
For each news article in our corpus , we retrieved the image URL specified in the header meta information of the web page the article was retrieved from , additionally recording each time an article did not have this property . If a URL was associated with 10 or more articles , we designated it as a “ Logo ” image . Following this , we took each URL extracted from the news articles , and attempted to download the image , performing face recognition on the image using the Viola Jones algorithm [ 10 ] in OpenCV [ 2 ] . If a face was present , we further performed gender classification on the largest face in the image , assigning a label of either “ Male ” or “ Female ” .
For gender classification , we extracted multi scale LBP features from each face image , before applying our gender classification algorithm [ 9 ] , based upon an online C Pegasos [ 20 ] , attaining an accuracy of over 95 % on the Labeled Faces in the Wild ( LFW ) dataset [ 8 ] .
We assessed the performance of our gender classifier under realistic conditions by applying our classifier to the LFW dataset , rescaled to mimic the sizes that we can expect to find in our news article images .
After this procedure , we could label each news article with one of six possible labels , as detailed in Table 1 , along with the number of news article falling into each category . Those news articles that were labelled “ Face ” were also further labelled as “ Male ” or “ Female ” , depending on the face gender recognised by the gender classification algorithm .
3 . FINDINGS
In our first set of experiments , we compared the proportion of male faces to female faces , denoted as the male/female ratio , in the news article images we collected , and looked at how this male/female ratio differed for each of the 15 topic categories .
In the second set of experiments , we compare the male/female ratio of the news articles by their publishing outlet , showing the extent of the gender bias towards males present in each outlet . 3.1 Gender Bias by Topic
We wanted to investigate how the number of men and women featured in the images associated with the news differs across topics . As a first test , to ensure that results are comparable across topics , we show the percentage of images assigned each image label per topic in Figure 1 . We can see that for each of the 15 topics , approximately 30–50 % of the articles do not have an associated image , either because there was no associated image , or the image URL returned no image . Another 10–20 % of the articles only have logo images , leaving 30–55 % of the articles with a non logo image . For those articles which have a face image , we find the proportion of faces assigned to each gender and compute the male/female ratio , as shown in Figure 2 . We can immediately see that in all topics except Fashion , there is a higher number of male faces than female faces , with Arts and Entertainment having the next lowest ratios of males to females . This is perhaps unsurprising , with other studies [ 1 , 6 ] finding similar results for these topics . The topic categories of Petroleum , Politics and Markets contain the largest gender bias , with almost four or more male faces to every female face that is displayed .
While we measure the male/female ratio of faces in news media images , there is an additional real world bias related to each topic which should be kept in mind . The male/female ratio of people working in related fields to each of these topics is not necessarily equal , and therefore can influence how often a male or female face is likely to be pictured in the news . 3.2 Gender Bias in Outlets
We also wanted to investigate how the gender bias of male to female faces in news images differed by the news outlet that published the images . Again , to ensure we could make fair comparisons across outlets , we show the image label breakdown for 20 well known outlets selected from the corpus in Figure 4 . We can see that for some outlets ( The Times , New York Times , The Telegraph , Chicago Tribune ) nearly every single news article did not contain a URL to an image , suggesting that these outlets simply do not use the header meta information as a way to associate news images with their article counterparts . We can also see that some outlets ( Fox , Guardian , Seattle Times ) are very likely to use an logo as the image for the article , instead of an image that represents the article content . For these reasons , we do not include these outlets in our following analysis of gender bias by outlet .
For the remaining 12 outlets , we can see their male/female ratio in Figure 3 . We can see that the tabloid style outlets ( Daily Mail , Daily News , Metro ) tend to have a lower gen

This difference could be down to the different topic distributions of the given outlets , where tabloid style outlets focus more heavily on topics which have a lower gender bias , while the broadsheet style outlets focus on higher gender bias topics such as Politics , Religion , Crime and Business . To further investigate this , Figure 5 shows the topic distributions for each of the 12 outlets . The Daily Mail has a large proportion of Politics articles by topic classification ( a high gender bias topic ) , but overall as an outlet has the lowest gender bias . This suggests that the Daily Mail does indeed feature more images of female faces in its news coverage , taking into account the topic distribution of the outlet . Another example of this is the Washington Post . where a large percentage of its coverage is devoted to Business and Markets ; topics where the average face gender ratio is roughly 3–4 male faces to each female face . Despite this , the Washington Post has an average gender bias ratio of 2.3 male faces to each female face .
We additionally grouped the outlets into tabloid style ( Daily
Mail , Daily News , Metro , New York Post ) and broadsheetstyle ( BBC , CNN , Forbes , Independent.ie , Daily Telegraph , Wall Street Journal , Washington Post ) outlets to compare the gender bias between these two types of outlets1 , with the results shown in Figure 6 . Topics that fall below the red line have a higher male/female ratio in broadsheet style outlets , while topics above the red line have a higher male/female ratio in tabloid style outlets2 . We can see that tabloid style outlets have a higher gender bias in Fashion and Weather topics than their broadsheet style counterparts , while broadsheet style outlets have a comparatively higher gender bias in Markets , Petroleum , Religion , Sports and Technology .
4 . CONCLUSIONS
The automation of news content analysis is a very promising direction in the social sciences , but it has so far been mostly limited to text [ 1 , 6 ] . The possibility of analysing the content of images in a very large scale paves the way to a completely new set of studies , gender bias being only one of the possibilities . It is now also possible to investigate the interplay between text and images , and how people are portrayed and represented in different countries , or different topics .
This study is intended as a feasibility study , but also it is the first study of this type to our knowledge .
