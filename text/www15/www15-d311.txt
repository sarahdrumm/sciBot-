ABSTRACT Film and television play an important role in popular culture . However studies that require watching and annotating video are time consuming and expensive to run at scale . We explore information mined from media database cast lists to explore the evolution of different roles over time . We focus on the gender distribution of those roles and how this changes over time . Finally , we compare real life census gender distributions to our web mediated onscreen gender data . We propose these methodologies are a useful adjunct to traditional analysis that allow researchers to explore the relationship between online and onscreen gender depictions .

INTRODUCTION
Film and television are an integral part of culture and one way that people understand and interact with it . Onscreen scenarios reflect the values from some real or imagined story , but also inform the viewers expectations . However , attempting to directly study film and television presents some issues . Watching video for analysis does not scale well to large datasets without significant manual effort . This limits most large scale study to easily digestible data sources : film popularity , box office figures , reviews , scripts and other metadata . Although non video data sources may be easier to study , they limit the types of questions researchers can ask . For example , box office figures do not allow detailed analysis of cinematography .
Our research question is whether web science can provide viable proxies that let us answer interesting social science research questions at scale . We use data available from a

Figure 1 is a section of the Internet Movie Database ( IMDb)1 cast list from “ The Big Lebowski ” 2 , showing performer names and images on the left , with their character name on the right . Some character names are names ( eg Arthur Digby Sellers ) , but some are professional roles ( eg Doctor ) or combinations of role and relation to other characters ( eg Nihilist Woman , Franz ’s Girlfriend ) . We exploit three factors from the data : productions are listed with their release date , male and female performers are distinguished in the data , and unnamed characters are usually listed by their role or profession . This lets us count gendered performances of a particular role over time , which can be used to explore social science questions . This paper is structured as follows : we discuss related work in media gender studies and IMDb in Section 2 . Section 3 describes the dataset and the methodology we use to handle noisy user generated data3 . We then explore what roles are found onscreen and how they change over time in Section 4 . In Section 5 , we examine how roles interact with gender over time and how this compares to real world gender distributions . We believe that web science methodologies can augment traditional manual analysis to enable comparison of online and onscreen gender depictions .

2 . BACKGROUND
Gender is a complex sociocultural phenomenon with a vast academic literature and we stress that this work makes limited exploration of gender itself . Instead we focus on some of the issues relating to gender in media as much as our data allows . Under representation of women is a long standing gender issue in media , both in terms of the gender of performers and also the subject matter , for example proportions of news stories that focus on females [ 11 ] . Moreover , Wood notes stereoptypical portrayals of hypermasculine , yet domestically incompetent , male characters and the female characters dependent on them , and complex relationships of power and image . This trend is confirmed in a more recent meta study of articles in a special issue of the Sex Roles journal [ 4 ] , which adds to this observations about the role of race and interesting conjecture about the effect of underrepresentation and the importance of also finding positive representations of women in media .
Many of gender media research questions require manual analysis . In their study of screen portrayals and media employment , Smith et al . consider 26 225 characters4 from the 600 top grossing films from 2007–2013 [ 10 ] . They find a low percentage of female speaking characters – consistently around 30 % over each year of their sample , and only 2 % of films features more female than male characters . They also study sexualisation of female characters , finding them more likely to be shown in revealing clothing , nude or referred to as attractive . They note the dearth of female content creators , noting that the number of female writers and directors is at a six year low circa 2014 . This extensive and detailed study is only made possible with a team of 71 highly trained student coders and to apply this depth of research at scale would be difficult and costly .
IMDb is an interesting source of data due to its size and popularity on the internet . Boyle notes that “ IMDb has been the focus of surprisingly little academic attention ” in her study of gender and movie reviews [ 3 ] . This consisted of analysing how gender is expressed ( or not ) in textual reviews for three different films and the online profiles of the reviewers . Data from IMDb has been used for research in the natural language processing and computational linguistics domain , primarily as the source of a corpus of movie reviews annotated with sentiment [ 8 ] . Other resources for gender information have been gathered from the US Census and automatically processed web text [ 1 , 2 ] . A possible application for gender data is in coreference resolution [ 9 ] , the task of clustering mentions that refer to the same entity in a document . For example , lists of male and female names may provide evidence whether the mentions he , Bob and manager should be matched together .
Detailed gender analyses of media are compelling yet difficult to conduct at scale . We hope to use metadata about screen media as a proxy for the original media to explore , albeit in a limited way , issues about gender and its onscreen representation . Web science methodologies , such as those used to study scanned books [ 6 ] , suggest useful starting points . The dataset in this study allows us to study how people report onscreen media using the web , but this kind of data can also influence other media . Specifically , cast information is part of the ecosystem of media reporting , advertising , review and commentary , and this can have real
44 506 of these were speaking roles . world impact . A study focussing on the dynamics of online film reviews found that volume significantly impacts box office sales , rather than content and ratings [ 5 ] . The authors attribute this to an indicator of underlying word of mouth information flow and that online reviews spread awareness of the film . User data is increasingly being directly used to assist decisions about what media a studio should produce5 and this is indicative of the complex relationship between onscreen media and the web .
3 . DATASET AND METHODS
Our methodology requires two simplifying assumptions . We assume that IMDb is a good proxy for onscreen entertainment , which we believe is a reasonable assumption for recent productions , but less so for older productions as we discuss below . We also assume that popular film and television is more likely to appear in a database like IMDb , and as such its aggregated content is a good estimator of what a random person would watch . Following from this , we ask the question : “ What are viewers likely to learn about roles and gender over time from onscreen entertainment ? ” .
We downloaded the plain text data files actorslistgz and actresseslistgz6 and applied several cleaning phases . The files list the performer name and the titles and dates of productions they appear in . Unfortunately , these lists do not distinguish between films , television , so it is difficult to distinguish between media – clearly an important methodological question . We exclude records where the performer is listed using an alternative name ( as . . . ) , and generate one record per appearance in a film or television episode . We further process records based on the role , filtering roles marked n/a , or those that reference selves ( eg himself , herself or themselves ) . We also remove markers of multiple similar roles : ordinal prefixes ( eg first or 1st ) from 1 ( 1 ) or ( #1) ) . Finally , we remove to 5 and suffixes ( eg any text in parentheses and split multi role characters ( eg model/actress ) , generating one count for each lower cased role . We aggregate roles by year and calculate a gender distribution for each role r and year y . Specifically , p(F|r , y ) is the count of records with role r in year y by a performer from the actresses list , normalised by the count of all r and y records.7
As with most user generated content , there are a number of caveats that apply to the data and our analysis . It is possible that performers can be misclassified and added to the wrong list file , or records listed with incorrect years . We would expect this to be the result of data entry error and focus our analysis on those with higher count , as to avoid this hopefully rare occurrence . There is also a significant observation bias as while it may be common for film and television to be listed as it enters production today , older productions are only listed if a user takes the effort to document them . As a result , older counts are susceptible to skew towards television productions with a strong internet based community dedicated to listing each and every episode .
We do not distinguish between films and television , and our processing considers a television episode equal to a film .

Table 2 : Top 10 newly popular roles for 20 year periods from 1920 . country , the language dependent processing would be possible . This might include mapping host and hostess using stemming , but this comes at the cost of conflating dissimilar concepts within or across languages . Finally , the role descriptions do not follow a fixed schema , so some equivalent role counts may be split by virtue of general synonymy ( eg director and filmmaker ) or different gender forms ( eg policeman , policewoman , cop , police officer ) . This problem may be alleviated by mapping IMDb roles onto a semantic ontology such as WordNet [ 7 ] .
After preprocessing , we retain 15 468 002 role records from between 1900 and 2020 ( Figure 2 ) . The number of entries grows from the early 20th century and increase steadily until the 1990s , when the rate of growth increases . Note that , although the data was collected in 2014 , there are records dated later than that , as IMDb lists ongoing and planned productions.8
4 . ROLES
The dataset allows us to track , at a very coarse level , what roles are popular in onscreen media and how has this changed over time . Table 1 shows the top 10 most common roles in 20 year periods from 1900 . This shows how roles have changed over time and reflects what roles are reported and seen on screen . Initial roles from 1900 are most often undetermined or stock characters ( mary , jack , the girl , the wife , daughter , husband ) . Roles from 1920 1940 are made up of dramatic roles that appear to be drawn from a crime or noir genre : henchman , policeman , detective . Others are ambiguous , as reporter and dancer could either be in a dramatic or actual role in a news broadcast or variety show . For the two decades from 1940 , there seems to be a shift towards news broadcasting ( ie newsreader , sports newsreader ,

Figure 2 : Count of roles over time .
This skews the data in favour of television and future work may be able to map to other resources to tease them apart . Likewise , we do not distinguish between the production country , which rules out potentially interesting national comparisons and language processing . We do not further process roles and so some may be character names and others professions . We might expect that professions will have higher counts , as it is more likely that generic roles are repeated in many records than character names . This means that we are comparing names and roles , which is somewhat inelegant , but extracting roles for main characters would require linking to external structured ( eg Freebase ) or unstructured plot data ( eg Wikipedia ) . Moreover , central characters are more important , but it ’s not immediately clear how to weight their influence so we believe that our approach is a pragmatic compromise .

We propose that the dataset is an interesting way to explore how onscreen roles change over time . We see evidence for a main hosted model of onscreen entertainment , with secondary trends , such as reality television . In older performances there seems also to be evidence of a skew towards television programmes that have been comprehensively documented , presumably by a dedicated internet based community .
5 . GENDER
One of the most valuable characteristics of our dataset is that each performer has gender information . Aggregating by role allows us to consider biases of the gender of onscreen roles . Figure 3 shows how roles over time are split between two genders , with counts for each gender and also the proportion of female roles ( p(F ) ) . From 1940 , we see a gradual increase in the proportion of roles played by female actors from 0.25 to 04 Before this period , total counts are somewhat lower , so it is difficult to draw conclusions . The higher female proportion around 1920 may reflect the fact that records correspond to film , not television , but this is difficult to establish without taking extra metadata into account .
Table 3 shows the 50 most frequent roles per gender . Of course , some of the roles of Table 1 appear again here , but it is already possible to see biases towards one of the genders .
Figure 3 : Count of roles from each gender over time , as well as the gender distribution p(F ) . weather forecaster ) , narration ( ie announcer , narrator ) and hosted television with host , singer and panelist . The trend of hosted television is maintained for the rest of the dataset , but we see evidence of shifts in trend : model from 1960–1980 , additional voices for cartoons from 1980–2000 , and finally reality television roles from 2000 ( ie contestant , judge ) .
While the above analysis shows the enduring popularity of hosted screen entertainment , this can obscure some of the emerging roles through time . Table 2 shows , for the same period , which roles are new and did not appear in the top 50 roles of the previous period . The 1900s list is the same as Table 1 as this is the first period used . The 1920s sees different descriptions of underspecified roles ( bit role vs undetermined role ) . There is a strong focus on hosted and news media from the 1940s and evidence of non English speaking entries ( corresponsal is Spanish for correspondent ) . From the 1960s , there is evidence of popular roles in children ’s television ( member of the short circus from “ The Electric Company ” ) , television soap operas ( paul williams , victor newman9 from “ The Young and the Restless ” ) . Newly popular roles in the 1980s and 1990s included game and quiz shows ( contestant , lexicographer from “ Countdown Masters ” ) , different television soap operas ( ridge forrester from “ The Bold and the Beautiful ” ) and new terms ( anchor and the gendered form co hostess ) . Roles thusfar from the two decades from 2000 reflects the recent trend for zombie characters in television , driven in part by the success of productions such as “ The Walking Dead ” , which typically feature many unnammed zombie characters and thus has a large impact on the count data . We see a continued trend of more first name roles ( laura , david and the gender ambiguous alex and sam ) , and roles that reflect current naming conventions ( police officer rather than policeman , the generic role mother and bar patron rather than the earlier bar fly ) . One concern with this method is that by only considering roles that have not been seen in a previous top 50 , then we may find that the listed roles are low rank or count with respect to the overall

Table 5 : Gender distribution grouped by profession . model and receptionist are frequent roles which are mostly female , as are hostess , girl , woman , waitress and mother , together with a series of frequent female first names . On the male side side , there seems to be strong bias for narrator , announcer , doctor , detective , bartender together with a series of security or military roles ( police officer , cop , soldier , guard ) , and again some gender specific roles like policemen , men , boy , waiter .
We can also analyse the gender distribution of common roles to characterise how gender relates to roles at a high level . As an example , we filtered the most common mentions with an overall count above 1 000 that did not belong to a list of common names from the US Census . To try and characterise the space of roles , we ordered them by p(F ) and partitioned them into five equal bins and randomly sampled 10 entries from each . Table 4 shows the results : on both extremes there are again gendered roles ( boyfriend , actress ) , while more towards the middle section some more interesting biases can be observed ( biker and basketball player as male and secretary as female ) . Note that due to the overall higher count of male occurrences , the midpoint of gender distribution is between the “ moderately ” and “ strongly ” female classes .
In [ 10 ] , the authors analyze 120 movies and show strong biases in the representation of executive roles . Inspired by that report , we looked for key roles in areas such as law , IT and religion and looked at the aggregated count of male and female actor in these roles . For each keyword listed in Table 5 , we looked for all roles that contained that word . We made exceptions for president where we looked only for exact matches , and bishop where we ignored those mentions that end with it to avoid including surnames .
Law and corporate professions had around 15 % of female representation , which coincides with the values reported in [ 10 ]
Figure 5 : Proportion of female in movie dataset vs . US Census . + indicates significant at p < 0.05 in a two tailed , two proportion Z test . for Law but not for corporate professions , while the medical domain ( doctors ) had a female probability of 023 In contrast to the results in [ 10 ] , Religion does not score at the bottom with regards to female presentation ( although very low with 008 ) From the professions we selected , Engineering was the lowest ( 005 ) The highest scoring profession was IT ( 0.52 ) , which is partly due to the fact that many computer voices were female ( computer had 460 female occurrences , versus 247 male ones ; and enterprise computer from “ Star Trek ” was almost exclusively female ) .
We can also examine role gender over time , searching for qualitative evidence that the gender associated with a specific role changes . Figure 4 shows the distribution of two roles , where we matched any role containing the query term . Onscreen nurses have been traditionally almost uniformly female until the 1990s and now one in five nurses are played by male performers . Conversely , the initial low proportion of onscreen female reporters has risen and the proportion is now relatively even .
Our analyses to this point have only referenced IMDb data , but it is also interesting to examine how onscreen gender distributions compare with their real world counterparts . Figure 5 shows how onscreen gender distributions

If a point is above the line ( eg map to those listed in the US Census10 . In both cases , the data was restricted to 2014 . Intuitively , points on the diagonal line have a portrayal consistent with the census reporter ) , distributions . then those roles are over represented onscreen by female performers . Conversely , points below the line suggest an under representation onscreen by female performers . For example , scientists , cashiers , nurses and managers are played more frequently by male performers than their census counterparts . There are several limitations of this analysis that should be taken into account before drawing strong conclusions . Firstly , comparing user generated roles with strict census roles introduces bias since we selected the mapping and selected roles . Linking roles from the different sources to a common ontology would present a useful way to reduce manual effort in this step . Secondly , we do not distinguish between US productions and those from other countries , so comparing with the US Census may introduce some noise . Overall , this analysis lets us draw an interesting exploratory counterpoint between onscreen gender representation and real world figures .
6 . CONCLUSION
Future work would concentrate on refining the data processing and adding useful structure for more rigorous statistical analysis . This includes linguistic analysis to aggregate role synonyms , many of which are multi word expressions .

Discriminating between media types ( film , television ) and genres may reveal interesting disparities on the gender proportion in them . Identifying a production country would also be useful for analysis and language identification . The IMDb data release does not report this information directly and it would have to be inferred . Our current model emphasises the importance of secondary characters and treats them equally . Extracting their roles from other data sources such as plot summaries or reviews would allow us to include major character roles and may motivate a “ central role ” weighting scheme . Contrasting on screen gender representation with real life data has the greatest potential from a web science standpoint . We provide exploratory analysis in Figure 5 , but further analysis would require matching the informal IMDb and formal census role ontologies .
This paper presents methodologies for mining information about onscreen media gender from cast lists . Despite the noise inherent in user generated data , we assert that large scale screen production metadata is a useful proxy for framing and answering questions about the evolution of roles over time , and how gender balances evolve . We propose that the methodologies make for a compelling adjunct to traditional manual analyses and can help study how onscreen media is reflected onto the web , and eventually , how the web influences onscreen media .
