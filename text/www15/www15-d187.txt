ABSTRACT Predicting accurate demographic information about the users of information systems is a problem of interest in personalized search , ad targeting , and other related fields . Despite such broad applications , most existing work only considers age prediction as one of classification , typically into only a few broad categories .
Here , we consider the problem of exact age prediction in social networks as one of regression . Our proposed method learns social representations which capture community information for use as covariates . In our preliminary experiments on a large real world social network , it can predict age within 4.15 years on average , strongly outperforming standard network regression techniques when labeled data is sparse .

INTRODUCTION
In recent years , there has been an abundance of work devoted to predicting hidden attributes of users from their interactions with information systems ( eg from their search queries[5 ] , blog posts[6 ] , and social interactions[1 , 3 , 4 , 8] ) . Surprisingly much of this existing work eschews exact prediction of user ’s ages , instead framing the problem as one of classification which can mask poor model performance in the presence of outliers and noisy data .
In this paper , we consider several methods which use social interactions to estimate hidden quantities in social networks . Our preliminary experiments on a large social network shows that accurate age prediction is possible , even when as little as 5 % of users have shared their age .

2 . NETWORK REGRESSION
The generalized regression problem frames the output variable y as a linear combination of the inputs variables x , plus a noise term . y = wT x + .
( 1 )
When an output variable has dependences with other ‘nearby’ response variables ( ie , y is auto correlated ) , the general regression model can be extended with additional covariates to model these local effects . In the social network setting , the dependencies between variables are given by the graph G = ( V , E ) of social interactions between users . These interdependencies between output variables are typically modeled as a Markov Random Field ( MRF ) . In a MRF , it is assumed that particular response variable yi depends on its neighborhood Ni ( the Markov assumption ) . In network regression , the output variables are usually assumed to be Gaussian , which leads to the following regression problem : j∈Ni yi = wN
1 |Ni| yj + .
( 2 )
We propose modeling these social dependencies instead with low dimensional social representations . Using the approach detailed in [ 7 ] , we learn a mapping function Φ : i ∈ V → R|V |×d which encodes each user i in a d dimensional representation that captures similarities between vertex cooccurrences in short random walks over the graph G . Our corresponding regression problem is then yi = wT Φ(i ) + ,
( 3 ) which unlike Eq 2 can be solved through standard methods , such as Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) .
3 . EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
In order to test the effectiveness of our proposed method , we conducted experiments on Pokec[9 ] , the most popular social network in Slovakia . Pokec is interesting to study for network analysis , as it is large ( |V | = 1 , 632 , 803 , |E| = 30 , 622 , 564 ) , contains user profile data , and is complete ( all users are present ) . The age distribution of Pokec is shown in Figure 1 . We consider the following methods for network regression1 : • Linear Regression + DeepWalk : Our proposed method learns social representations [ 7 ] , and performs

Table 1 : Age prediction performance as evaluated through both mean absolute error ( MAE ) and R2 on Pokec . an OLS regression . We use the hyperparameters ( dimensionality d=128 , window size w=10 , walks per node γ=10 , and walk length t=40 ) . • Iterative Algorithm : This method uses an iterative solver ( in the spirit of Besag ’s iterative conditional modes [ 2 ] ) to find a solution to Eq 2 . Such iterative approaches deal with label sparsity by propagating information within their neighborhoods , but can suffer from the presence of noisy labels . • Neighborhood Average : Also known as the weightedvote Relational Neighbor ( wvRN ) , this algorithm assumes that each node is the average of its neighbors . In the absence of labeled neighbors , it predicts the mean . • Predict Mean This naive algorithm simply predicts the mean value of the training data .
We test these methods by taking the 1,138,314 nodes from Pokec which have ages entered in their profile , and splitting them into training and testing sets . We vary the amount of data available for training , from 5 % to 95 % , and test on the remainder of the data . We repeat this process 5 times and present averages . To evaluate the performance on the testing set we use the mean absolute error ( MAE ) and the coefficient of determination ( R2 ) . The MAE corresponds to the average age in years that our predictions are off by , while R2 gives an indication of how much of the total variance is captured by the model .
The results of this experiment are shown in Table 1 . We see that using linear regression on DeepWalk features provides the best MAE until 95 % of training data is used , and that it can predict a user ’s age within 4.15 years on average . We note that OLS+DeepWalk ’s R2 consistently outperforms all methods as the training data is increased from 5 % to 95 % . This strong performance means that a more complicated regression technique may be able to extract additional gains from the representations .
For the other methods , we see that the Iterative Algorithm is better able to deal with label sparsity , and consistently has a lower MAE and higher R2 than the Neighborhood Average . At 95 % training data , the Iterative Algorithm manages to achieve a lower MAE than using DeepWalk features , but has a worse R2 score . This indicates that the Iterative Algorithm is making more extreme errors than OLS , perhaps the result of propagating incorrect information .
4 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK These results show that accurate age detection is possible in social networks without the use of any extra profile data , blog posts , or web history . The strong performance of our method when only a very small number ( 5 % ) of nodes’ ages are provided is both interesting and also worrying , raising privacy concerns .
Our continued work in the area has two focuses . First , we would like to improve prediction accuracy further for
