ABSTRACT Scientific literature till date can be thought of as a partially revealed landscape , where scholars continue to unveil hidden knowledge by exploring novel research topics . How do scholars explore the scientific landscape , ie , choose research topics to work on ? We propose an agent based model of topic mobility behavior where scholars migrate across research topics on the space of science following different strategies , seeking different utilities . We use this model to study whether strategies widely used in current scientific community can provide a balance between individual scientific success and the efficiency and diversity of the whole academic society . Through extensive simulations , we provide insights into the roles of different strategies , such as choosing topics according to research potential or the popularity . Our model provides a conceptual framework and a computational approach to analyze scholars’ behavior and its impact on scientific production . We also discuss how such an agent based modeling approach can be integrated with big real world scholarly data .

INTRODUCTION
1 . An important aspect of scholarly life is to do research and generate knowledge . The scholarly world can be viewed as a community effort in exploring the space of knowledge .
∗To appear in BigScholar , WWW 2015 †The work was done when Dr . Srinivasan was affiliated with IE , CUHK .
A well established approach for analyzing research activities is to study the networks arising out of the research process ; more specifically , the ( author author ) collaboration networks [ 8 ] , and the ( paper paper ) citation networks [ 14 ] . These studies let us see how researchers collaborate , and how new knowledge discovery is built on past discoveries , and even how collaborations help knowledge discovery . But these research output based studies do not focus on motives for how researchers choose what to work on . In this work , we hypothesize that how researchers choose topics is the key hidden variable that drives the research process of the community as a whole . An author chooses his collaborators based on similarity of topics , and a paper cites other papers on related topics . Through researchers’ strategic behavior in choosing topics to work on , the authors cause topics to emerge , grow , sustain or decay . Thus , by understanding scholars’ behavior of choosing topics , we can better characterize the evolution of scientific research .
We take inspiration from two existing streams in the literature . First , Map of Science [ 1 , 3 ] is a well known effort towards characterizing the relationships between different topics , using textual and citation information in the literature . By classifying and visualizing the existing papers as objects in an abstract 2 D space , they provide an atlas of science [ 1 ] . If research topics and knowledge can be represented as a terrain , then researchers’ choice of research topics over time can be considered as navigating through this space . The other inspiration comes from the spatialtemporal models in evolutionary biology [ 5 ] , where species occupy a fitness landscape that evolves subject to environmental changes . Could knowledge exploration by scholars be understood in terms of similar kind of processes , with strategic choices and motives ? In the research context , the fitness landscape ideally represents the potential knowledge to be gained from different topics , which in turn drives the occupancy distribution [ 2 ] . Scholars may choose their future topics in their current neighborhood through random search ( mutation ) , based on their potential ( selection ) or by observing other scholars’ behavior ( imitation ) , and through their activities alter the fitness landscape [ 11 ] .
The underlying framework is essentially game theory , where scholars are assumed to be rational decision makers following different strategies driven by certain professional or personal reward system . However , in order to derive analytically tractable solutions for the equilibrium reached by these games , it is necessary to make strong simplifying assumptions on the models . An alternative approach is to build a computational agent based model ( ABM ) , where agents act according to a local set of rules , and the system ’s evolution and equilibrium can be simulated . ABMs have been proposed for studying various phenomena in the scientific domain such as division of labor , co evolution of citation and collaboration networks [ 13 ] . Furthermore , ABMs can naturally include a spatial component , thus enabling us to verify the model via a visual representation .
There are several existing ABMs that can be adapted to describe scholar mobility . For instance , in the Sugarscape model ( originally proposed to study wealth distribution ) [ 4 ] , agents move randomly around the grid , collecting “ sugar ” and “ spice ” ( resources that agents need to survive ) . Similarly in the scientific context , scholars work on different topics and gain scientific achievements , which support them to survive in academic community . However , this model only considers the simple case of random walk , and the setting of renewable resource is not suitable for our purposes . Another model by Weisberg and Muldoon [ 13 ] describes scholars’ activity as a hill climbing process to find peaks , which investigate the efficiency of three widely used searching strategies of scholars : controls , set a direction leading to a larger height ; followers , only choose from patches visited by others ; and mavericks , only choose unvisited patches . Since there is no resource collecting in this model , agents don’t have states of “ birth ” , “ death ” , and “ survival ” . A more realistic model should incorporate both concept of resource collecting and consumption , as well as a mixture of strategies . Thus , we propose the Research Topic Selection model ( RTS ) . We also discuss how our study can be validated against observed scholar mobility of topics derived from real world data .
2 . THE RTS MODEL A typical ABM consists of dynamically interacting rulebased agents , the systems within which agents interact can represent complex real world like scenarios . We first give definitions of the Research Topic Selection model(RTS ) model in terms of elements : space , agents and rules , and then present simulation results .
2.1 Scientific Landscape In our model , we consider the whole corpus of knowledge to as a map . A specific research topic is represented as an mdimension point on the map , in which the spatial distance between any two topics indicates their semantic correlation . Although such a map could potentially be embedded in a high dimensional space , we use a 2 D space in our study , in order to simplify the simulation and facilitate visualization .
In such a map , each point ( xi , yi ) has another dimension “ height ” h(xi , yi ) , used to represent the scientific significance of the corresponding topic . We call this kind of scientific map the scientific landscape [ 2 ] . In our model , we assume that each topic has an intrinsic scientific value before being explored , which will be revealed by scholars’ research activity . In the real scientific community , the scientific value may be inferred via surrogate metrics , eg , citation counts , research grants , etc . The problem of how to precisely measure the significance needs further study , but here we assume a scientific landscape with virtual significance .
2.2 Scholar Agents In the ABM , scholars are represented as individual agents . An initial position is assigned to each agent on the scientific landscape . At each cycle of time during the simulation , agents choose a topic in the neighbourhood following certain local strategies . Upon arriving at a new research topic , agents collect a certain amount of scientific significance on it . In the scientific context , “ movement ” corresponds to scholars changing research topics ; “ collected significance ” corresponds to scientific production , such as publishing papers or making breakthrough discoveries . Since a scholar leaves the community if he fails to produce research achievements for a long time , we assume there is a “ metabolism ” rate which causes each agent ’s collected significance to decay over time . Therefore , agents need to collect significance sufficiently to sustain in the community . In order to make the model more realistic , we set several variables for each agent :
Vision : A scholar doesn’t know the whole landscape , but can only “ see ” within a limited scope . Vision limits agents’ scope of cognition hence neighbourhood to choose from . We believe that most scholars change topics over time with some continuity , since it is risky to step into a domain far away from his expertise and background . But the vision size can have a large variance among different scholars .
It ’s not the physiological age of scholars , Academic Age : but the academic career length . In the real life academic community , a scholar sooner or later retires and stops publishing papers . We can thus set “ retirement age ” for scholars . Though we set a constant retirement age for this study , it can be easily extended to a random one in the future work .
Metabolism Rate : the decay rate of agents’ collected significance in each time cycle . The terminology is adopted from Sugarscape [ 4 ] . One can also find supporting evidence from bibliometrics , where it is a common phenomenon for a paper ’s citation count to reach its peak soon after publication , and then decline steadily [ 12 ] . In our model , we assume an author ’s significance declines exponentially , where λ is the metabolism rate :
S(t ) = S0.e(−λt ) , ∆S(t ) = −λ.S(t )
Knowledge Discovery Rate ( KDR ) : we assume the free significance ∆hi an agent can collect from topic i at time t depends on its remaining significance , where α is the KDR :
∆hi = α.hi(t )
One advantage of the RTS model is that it is flexible to add or modify variables . However , it is to be noted that a small change in a variable may lead to significantly different behaviors .
2.3 Strategies The Weisberg and Muldoon model [ 13 ] categories searching strategies by how agents consider topics’ intrinsic research value and popularity to make decisions . We agree that intrinsic research value and popularity are two major factors influencing scholars’ choices . But scholars in our model have varing goals , eg , to survive long in the academic community or achieve greater scientific significance , not just finding the most important topics . Thus we define four types of strategy by different criteria : Experts : research value prefer topics with high scientific value . They are scholars who have capability to recognize topics’ intrinsic value and make decisions independently . Followers : hotness prefer currently hot topics . They follow trends because they lack ability to estimate the value of topics as experts , or are interested in immediate rewards . Mavericks : novelty prefer unexplored topics . These authors are often pioneers discovering the “ new world ” , though the strategy is potentially risky . Conservatives : maturity prefer well established research areas ( not necessarily trending ) .
Agents employ the following movement rules at each cycle : Experts : Check : Any patch in my vision has higher significance than my current patch ? If yes , move to the patch of highest significance ; If no , stay . Mavericks : Check : Any patch in my vision hasn’t been visited yet ? If yes , randomly move to one of the candidate patches . If no , check : any patch has higher significance ? If yes , move to one of those patches ; If no , stay . Followers : Check : Any patch in my vision has other visitors currently ? If yes , check : any of them has higher significance ? If yes , randomly move to one of those patches ; If no , check : any other patch is currently unoccupied ? If yes , randomly move to one of patches ; If no , stay . If no , randomly move to one of patches . Conservatives : Check : Any patch in my vision has ever been visited ? If yes , check : any of them has higher significance ? If yes , randomly move to one of the patches ; If no , check : any other patch hasn’t been visited ? If yes , randomly move to one of patches ; If no , stay . If no , randomly move to one the patches .
We don’t claim that they are only strategies for scholars and our model is flexible to include other strategies .
3 . SIMULATIONS We conduct simulations of RTS model using the tool NetLogo . In our simulations , the scientific landscape is built on a 50 patch by 50 patch grid . we use two Gaussian functions to define the significance [ 13 ] with added noise , as in Fig 1 . In the beginning , each scholar agent ak is assigned to a patch ( xak , yak ) , with initial collected significance ( or wealth ) ro(ak ) , academic age go(ak ) , and vision v(ak ) . Then in each cycle time , agents move to one patch and collect significance on the patch . Before we discuss the simulation results , we first define several metrics for the performance evaluation of strategies .
3.1 Evaluation Matrices In our model , science significance is a non increasing resource which will be consumed by scholar agents . On the other hand , agents will depart the community if they deplete their wealth or reach the retire time . Thus , we are most interested in questions : a ) What type of scholars can survive the longest ? b ) What type of scholars can achieve the most success ? c ) Which strategy is the most social efficient ? We design the following three evaluation metrics :
1 . Individual Cumulative Achievements ( ICA ) : sum mation of achievements an agent collected during the whole academic life .
2 . Progress : ratio of consumed significance by all agents compared to the landscape ’s initial significance .
3 . Coverage : ratio of patches visited as least once by all agents .
Agents ICA evaluates strategies by the efficiency for individual , progress and coverage evaluate the social efficiency for the entire community .
Figure 1 : 2D representation of scientific landscape with four types of agents randomly located .
3.2 Single Strategy Scenarios We first ran simulations involving single type of strategy in the population . As can be seen in Fig 2 , mavericks lead largest coverage , experts produce lest coverage . The cause is that experts tend to congregate on high topics , while other three types of agents are flexible to choose diverse topics , especially mavericks . From Fig 3 , we find experts has largest progress when the population contains less than 150 agents . But when the population increases , since all experts still choose topics of highest significant , they have intense competition , resulting in low Progress .
Fig 4 show the personal ICA distribution , we can see that experts have skewed ICA , while mavericks have balanced ICA . It gives an interesting implication : in a community of mavericks , agents tend to study diverse topics and have balanced personal achievements ; however , in a community of experts , since each agent are able to identify the highest significant topics , there are fierce competition among them which leads to skewed individual ICA .
3.3 Multiple Strategies Co existing Scenarios We then conduct simulations with a mixed population of four types of agents . An interesting question is which type will win ? Will the four types of agents collaborate or compete with each other ? A population of 200 agents are initialized in the system , equally assigned to the four types . We study the influence of three parameters : vision , metabolism rate and KDR on the performance of four strategies e g a r e v o C

331 Vision Vision defines the size of neighborhood an agent can see when making decisions . From Fig 5 , Fig 6 and Fig 7 , we find a counterintuitive phenomenon that with large size of vision , experts become less suited for survival than in case with small size of vision . The reason lies on the social impact of the crowd . If the source of information is large enough , followers , conservatives and mavericks can utilize the wisdom of crowd to make good decisions . On the contrary , the larger space experts can see , the higher possibility that all of them aggregate to the high positions , which results in intense competition . This phenomenon proves the importance of utilizing wisdom of crowd in a social community .
332 Metabolism Rate Metabolism Rate λ determines how quickly agents’ achievements decay over time . From Fig 8 , Fig 9 and Fig 10 , first we find that when the metabolism rate becomes larger , the probability of agents departing the system at early age also increases , leading to skewed ICA distributions . Moreover , we find that the influence of metabolism rate is most severe on mavericks . Mavericks have small number of departures in case of λ = 0.2 , but the early departure increase dramatically when λ = 0.8 , much worse than other three . Therefore , mavericks prefer low metabolism rate , which in reality corresponds to a relaxed research environment , e.g , adequate faculty positions , sufficient research resource and funding , no demanding requirement of yearly publications . Historically , one can see that several breakthrough discoveries were made in such less demanding environments , which foster innovation .

Followers and conservatives sustain and build on the research efforts of mavericks and experts , collectively increasing the community ’s knowledge base . This inspire us to do further investigation of the structure and component of the community , by analysis on big scholarly data .

As we can see from Fig 11 , Fig 12 and Fig 13 , mavericks are most sensitive to the change of Knowledge Discovery Rate λ . A large λ means that the significance of a topic will be quickly consumed , thus the early arrivals to an unexplored area can have a big advantage . Since mavericks always seek novel and less visited topics , they are more likely to take the advantage of being pioneers .
From above analysis , we can have an insight of what roles the four types of agents play in the scientific community . From the perspective of personal success , the four types of agents have different sensitivity of the parameters in research circumstance . From the view of social efficiency , both mavericks and experts make essential contributions : experts act as leaders to rich areas around their expertise , and mavericks explore innovative areas to maximize the system ’s di

4 . DISCUSSION & FUTURE WORK Model Extension : In our RTS model , we study a scenario that each scholar agent adopts a fixed type of strategy during the simulation . But in real academic community , a researcher might change strategies in different stages of her career , eg , being a follower as a fresh graduate , and switching to be an expert after accumulating enough knowledge and expertise . In other words , a scholar chooses the best strategy , whose utility changes with his academic age , vision , and also the strategies by other scholars . The current RTS model can be considered as an abstraction of how things play out given a particular mix of strategies in a certain equilibrium .
Extending our model to allow changing strategies will be an interesting future work . Furthermore , one can also introduce arrivals and departures for agents in this dynamic process . Another key component missing in this work , is that of collaborative efforts . Since the model requires extensive modifications to accommodate collaboration , we do not discuss it in this paper .
Topic Mapping and Visualization : We assume a 2 D scientific landscape of multiple Gaussian functions in the simulation , but what is the real scientific landscape ? Building the map of scientific landscape from real scholarly data is a big challenge .
Significant efforts build the map of science by using the textual and citation information in the literature . Topics model [ 6 ] , eg , LDA , dimensionality reduction techniques [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , eg , PCA and LSA are used to derive a lowdimensional representation of publications . More recently , there is renewed interest in using non linear dimensionality reduction ( NLDR ) techniques such as Deep Learning [ 10 ] to improve the accuracy of visual representation .
To have a qualitative evaluation whether the neural network method works , we conduct an simple experiment by implementing both PCA and autoencoder algorithms [ 7 ] on a sample data from Microsoft academic Libra dataset.The data consists of 15606 papers from five conferences in the computer science domain , as listed in Table 1 . Using titles and keywords of the papers , we built a corpus of 3857 words . To facilitate visualization , the output data is reduced to 2 dimensions . Fig 14 shows the resulting 2D map of papers using the autoencoder algorithm . What is a good map of science ? Minimally , the structure of the map must show strong clustering of papers from known scientific subdomains . From Fig 14 , we find the map produced by autoencoder does show a clear division of the three subdomains we picked , and even distinguishes the different conferences inside the same subdomain . By comparison , our attempt with the PCA algorithm had a more ambiguous partition ( not shown due to lack of space ) . Thus , the neural network approach seems promising . In the future work , we plan to study how to train neural networks using complete Libra dataset to build the scientific landscape .
Validation model with big scholarly data : While most spatial ABMs [ 9 ] are used for modeling only , we hope to achieve some level of validation of the RTS model with real big scholarly data , by visualizing the research topic trajectories of different scholars , and analyzing the same authors using traditional methods to assess their performance , in terms of activity , productivity , and life time .

5 . CONCLUSIONS We proposed a computation model to study the behavior of individual scholars on how they choose research topics in their research career . From preliminary simulation results , we find even simple models can reflect interesting phenomena of research practices in scholarly communities . We created four types of scholars who play different roles : experts lead scholars to topics with high research potentials , mavericks are the pioneers of novel topics , followers and conservatives utilize the wisdom of crowds . The ratio of scholars adopting certain strategies has significant impact on the health and progress of our scientific community . Validating our model with big scholarly data is a challenging direction in our future study .
