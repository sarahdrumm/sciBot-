ABSTRACT Automatic opinion lexicon extraction has attracted lots of attention and many methods have thus been proposed . However , most existing methods depend on dictionaries ( eg , WordNet ) , which confines their applicability . For instance , the dictionary based methods are unable to find domain dependent opinion words , because the entries in a dictionary are usually domain independent . There also exist corpus based methods that directly extract opinion lexicons from reviews . However , they heavily rely on sentiment seed words that have limited sentiment information and the context information has not been fully considered . To overcome these problems , this paper presents a word vector and matrix factorization based method for automatically extracting opinion lexicons from reviews of different domains and further identifying the sentiment polarities of the words . Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and performs better than the stateof the art methods .

INTRODUCTION
Opinion lexicon is a crucial resource for sentiment analysis . Although there are several opinion lexicons publicly available , it is hard to maintain a universal opinion lexicon to cover all domains , as sentiment polarities of words may vary significantly from do main to domain . For example , the opinion word , unpredictable , is likely to be positive in a movie review but negative in a car review . Therefore , it is attractive to automatically identify the sentiment polarities of opinion words for different domains .
Many existing studies on opinion lexicon extraction heavily rely on broad coverage dictionaries ( eg , WordNet ) . However , dictionary based methods fail to deal with the domain dependency problem , because the entries in a dictionary are often domain independent . Recently , corpus based graph models for automatic opinion lexicon extraction have emerged and prevailed , where the polarities of opinion words are inferred by the sentiment labels of seed words . However , these methods are very sensitive to seed words and improper seed words may lead to poor performance [ 5 ] . Yu et al . [ 5 ] proposed a method that utilizes the sentiment labels of documents instead of seed words . However , this method ignores the semantic association between words in the documents .
In [ 2 ] , Liang et al . developed a model , CONR , that takes both the sentiment labels of documents and the semantic relationships between words into accoun . Inspired by CONR , we develop a Word Vector and Matrix Factorization ( WVMF ) based method that improves CONR from two aspects : First , CONR captures the semantic relationship between opinion words through pointwise mutual information , which suffers from the sparsity problem . To overcome this problem , WVMF employs pre trained word vectors for similarity measurement ; Second , WVMF adds more features including inverse document frequency to calculate the sentiment contribution of a given word .
2 . THE PROPOSED METHOD Let D = fd1 ; d2 ; :: : ; dmg denote a set of m documents , and L = fligm i=1 denote the corresponding sentiment labels , where li = +1 if the corresponding document di is positive ; Otherwise , li = ,1 . Let W = fw1 ; w2 ; :::wng denote the vocabulary . We can then define an m . n matrix R to indicate the relationships between documents and words : rij = 1 , if wj 2 di ; Otherwise , rij = 0 . C is defined as an m . n sentiment contribution matrix , where cij denotes the sentiment contribution of wj to di . We define S as a n . n influence matrix , where sij characterizes the semantic similarity between wi and wj .
67 WVMF outperforms all baseline methods . Table 1 presents the accuracy of all methods in identifying the sentiment polarities of the top k opinion words . It is observed that the matrix factorization based methods including WEED , SVD and NMF consistently outperform the seed word based method SO PMI . Particularly , the proposed WVMF method exhibits consistent better performance than the best state of the arts method CONR .

Since it is noticed that words with high frequencies are more important and words only occur in positive or negative documents are more informative , we can define cij as
(
) li cij = T F i(wj ) · IDF ( wj ) ·
F ( pos)(wj ) F ( neg)(wj )
;
( 1 ) where T F i(wj ) is the term frequency of wj in di ; IDF ( wj ) is the inverse document frequency of wj ; F ( pos=neg)(wj ) is the frequency of wj occurring in the positive/negative corpus .
In this paper , the similarity between two words is measured by the cosine distance with the word vectors that are trained on Google News and publicly available [ 3 ] .
Therefore , the matrix factorization based method that combines both the document word relationship and the word word relationship can be formulated as min U;V

Finally , the sentiment polarity of wj can thus be derived as fol lows :

!j =

3 . EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
We carried out experiments on three publicly available datasets from different domains , namely , IMDB1 , Movie reviews2 , and DVD reviews3 The opinion words for testing were obtained from MPQA4 . We adopted five representative methods , SO PMI , WEED , SVD , NMF and CONR , as the baselines . SO PMI [ 4 ] is a typical seed word based method and thus we randomly selected 20 % seed words for it from MPQA ; WEED [ 5 ] is an optimization based method ; SVD , NMF [ 1 ] and CONR [ 2 ] are all matrix factorization based .
Figure 1 presents the accuracy of all methods in extracting opinion words from the datasets of different domains . It can be seen that 1http://aistanforedu/amaas/data/sentiment/ 2http://wwwcscornelledu/people/pabo/movie review data/ 3http://wwwdatatangcom/data/44115/ 4http://mpqacspittedu/
