ABSTRACT Why does Smith follow Johnson on Twitter ? In most cases , the reason why users follow other users is unavailable . In this work , we answer this question by proposing TagF , which analyzes the who follows whom network ( matrix ) and the whotags whom network ( tensor ) simultaneously . Concretely , our method decomposes a coupled tensor constructed from these matrix and tensor . The experimental results on million scale Twitter networks show that TagF uncovers different , but explainable reasons why users follow other users .

INTRODUCTION
Why does Smith follow Johnson on Twitter ? Is it because Johnson posts interesting tweets about politics or just because Smith and Johnson are friends ? It is valuable to answer such questions not only for understanding user behaviors , but also for a lot of applications such as user recommendations , ads , and community discovery .
We propose to answer such questions , by doing a joint study , of ( a ) the who follows whom network ( matrix ) and ( b ) the who tags whom network ( tensor ) . We show that our proposed method TagF tells us the reasons why users follow other users . For example , if we observe that user A follows B and also A tags B by a tag politics , we can safely say that the reason why A follows B is that A is interested in B ’s ( interesting ) tweets about politics . However , since the who tags whom network is extremely sparse , most of whofollows whom relationships are still not explained . Hence , TagF performs multilinear analysis of the coupled matrix and tensor to find the latent patterns shared on these two types of networks . Related work . There are only a few studies aiming at explaining the reason why users follow other users [ 1 , 3 ] . These studies are different from ours in that they use only
Figure 1 : Given user × user matrices F and F T , and a user × user × tag tensor T , TagF simultaneously factorizes these matrices and tensor into R components , which correspond to latent patterns on the networks . the who follows whom network . There are also a small number of studies analyzing Twitter lists [ 5 , 4 ] . However , these studies do not focus on the reasons to follow . Contributions . ( a ) Method : we design a novel method called TagF to uncover why users follow other users , which is based on the multilinear analysis of the coupled tensor , ( b ) Experiment : we perform an experiment on the whofollows whom and the who tags whom networks on Twitter , and ( c ) Discoveries : we qualitatively show from the results that users have different , but explainable reasons to follow other users .
2 . OUR APPROACH
We define the problem of uncovering the reason why users follow other users as the coupled tensor analysis problem . We model the who follows whom network as a matrix F , and the who tags whom network as a 3 mode ( user , user , tag ) tensor T , where Fij = 1 iff user i follows user j , and Tijk = 1 iff user i tags user j by tag k . We construct coupled tensor X by adding matrix F and its transpose F T into tensor T as the last two slices along with the third mode of T ( Fig 1 ) . Note that we employ both F and F T for multilinear analysis , which enables us to study the forward and mutual relationships between users ( see Section 3 for details ) . Analyzing coupled tensor X , we can find the implicit reasons to follow based on the explicit tagging behaviors of users . We adopt the PARAFAC [ 2 ] as a tool for our analysis . TagF decomposes coupled tensor X into the sum of R comr=1 ar⊗br⊗cr ( Fig 1 ) . Three vectors of each component correspond to three modes of original tensor X : a , b , and c correspond to source users , destination users , and tags ( or reasons to follow ) , respectively . Each ponents as X ≈R
137 ( a ) Hockey component
( b ) Writers component
Tag hockey ( 0.9988 ) , sports ( 0.0197 ) , media ( 0.0052 )
Follow F element ( 0.0476 ) , F T element ( 0.0009 )
Tag writers ( 0.9983 ) , bloggers ( 0.0002 ) , artists ( 0.0002 )
Follow F element ( 0.0416 ) , F T element ( 0.0409 )
Figure 2 : TagF results make sense : top 3 tags and F /F T elements in cr , and top 30 source and destination users in ar and br in hockey component ( left ) and writers component ( right ) . The reulsts indicate that in the hockey component , a lot of source users unidirectionally follow the representative destination users because only the F element is large , while in the writers component , two representative source users and a lot of destination users follow each other because both F and F T elements are large . component can be regarded as a latent pattern in tensor X . For example , in Fig 1 , the first component means that three source users ( in a ) follows one destination user ( in b ) by two reasons ( in c ) . The important point is that , in the first component , the last two elements of c corresponding to F and F T ( shown as red and orange in Fig 1 ) have large values , meaning this component illustrates the reason why these users follow each other . On the other hand , only the red element has a large value in the second component , indicating this component shows just the one way reason why users follow other users . We call these two elements F element and F T element . Dataset details . We collected the who follows whom network directly from Twitter , and also collected Twitter lists to construct the who tags whom network . Twitter lists can be regarded as the who tags whom relationships among users [ 4 ] as follows : a user ( ie , tagger ) makes a list with a name ( ie , tag ) and adds other users ( ie , tagged users ) into the list . In this experiment , we use top 50 frequent list names as tags , and discard other lists . As a result , our dataset includes 1,821,432 who follows whom relationships and 179,868 who tags whom relationships among 147,541 users . Since F is much denser than T , we suppress the effect of F by dividing all the elements of F and F T by the ratio r of the non zero elements of F and F T to that of T ( on this dataset , r is about 20 ) . Our dataset is made available at http://dxdoiorg/105281/zenodo13966 , and our code is also made available at https://github.com/yamaguchiyu to/tagf .
3 . RESULTS
Fig 2 shows two representative components from the result . Each figure shows the top 3 tags and F /F T elements in cr , and the top 30 source and destination users with the largest values in ar and br . We can see that each component is represented by the tags hockey and writers , respectively . These results can be interpreted as follows : ( a ) in the hockey component ( left ) a lot of source users unidirectionally follow three representative destination users because these destination users post about hockey , and ( b ) in the writers component ( right ) two representative source users and a lot of destination users follow each other because these users are friends in the writers community . The hockey compo nent is the one way pattern because only F element has a large value , on the other hand , the writers component is the mutual pattern because both F and F T element have large values . These patterns of user interactions are indeed observed on the original who follows whom network , indicating our TagF can successfully identify the reasons why users follow other users . Although we only show the top 30 source/destination users in Fig 2 , the top 1,000 source users in the hockey component have values larger than 0.02 , and indeed follow three representative destination users .
4 . CONCLUSION
We proposed TagF , which aims at finding the reasons why users follow other users by analyzing the who follows whom network and the who tags whom network simultaneously . Our contributions are three fold : ( a ) method , ( b ) experiments , and ( c ) discoveries ( see Introduction ) . It is implied from our discoveries that users have different , but explainable reasons to follow other users .
