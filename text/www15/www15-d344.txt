ABSTRACT Predicting the next location of a user based on their previous visiting pattern is one of the primary tasks over data from location based social networks ( LBSNs ) such as Foursquare . Many different aspects of these so called “ check in ” profiles of a user have been made use of in this task , including spatial and temporal information of check ins as well as the social network information of the user . Building more sophisticated prediction models by enriching these check in data by combining them with information from other sources is challenging due to the limited data that these LBSNs expose due to privacy concerns .
In this paper , we propose a framework to use the location data from LBSNs , combine it with the data from maps for associating a set of venue categories with these locations . For example , if the user is found to be checking in at a mall that has cafes , cinemas and restaurants according to the map , all these information is associated . This category information is then leveraged to predict the next checkin location by the user . Our experiments with publicly available check in dataset show that this approach improves on the state of the art methods for location prediction .

INTRODUCTION
The location prediction problem in LBSNs has been widely studied in recent years . This has wide applications in areas such as targeted marketing since knowing that a specific user ’s next check in is likely to be at a cinema could be used to prioritise movie ticket offers to be sent to her . LBSNs typically do not expose the check in information of users ; most popular LBSNs such as FourSquare1 and BrightKite2 1http://wwwpublicasuedu/∼hgao16/datasethtml 2http://snapstanfordedu/data/loc brightkitehtml

Table 1 : List of features used in different techniques have their datasets publicly available that are annonymised , wherein only the latitude and longitude of each check in is available because of privacy concerns . The unavailability of the category ( viz . , restaurant , cinema etc . ) information with historical check ins in LBSN data has led to development of location prediction methods that do not look to leverage category information . However , it may be observed that map information from sources such as Google Maps ( or FourSquare itself ) have information about popular venues such as restaurants and cinemas along with their lat long information . Thus , approximate spatial joins across checkin and map data can be intuitively used to infer category information for each check in . Such joins are restrained to provide category information only at a coarse granularity since there could be multiple types of venues ( eg , restaurants , coffee shops ) at the same location ( eg , a mall or a food court ) . In this paper , we consider the problem of inferring category information with each check in and leveraging such coarse grained category information to improve location prediction in LBSNs . The location prediction model in general does not perform good because of sparisity in the check in data . Therefore , analysis on sparse and annonymised data is useful to achieve atleast some improvement . To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that exploits such coarse grained category information for next check in location prediction .
Related Work : In Table 1 we have broadly divided and summarised the feature space that has been used for location prediction problem by state of the art methods . It can be seen from table 1 that only Noulas et al in [ 5 ] have explored the category information in predicting where the user would go next . However , [ 5 ] assume that the check in information contains not only fine grained category information ( eg , restaurant , cinema etc . ) but also contains information about the precise venue the user has checked in , ie , the name of the restaurant or cinema . Thus , this technique is impractical in common cases where we have check ins specified only at the lat long level . The other methods listed in Table 1 are able to work with check in data at the level of lat long information .

2 . METHODOLOGY
We first discuss inferring coarse grained category information by correlating lat long check in data with map information . Next , we briefly describe the SHM+T model proposed in [ 3 ] and describe our method that extends SHM+T by exploiting category information to improve location prediction accuracy . 2.1 Inferring Categories
We use a publicly available annonymised check in dataset [ 3 ,
1 ] where each check in has only a lat long representation . We associate each check in l = [ lat , long ] with a set of categories of venues ( using FourSquare API ) that are within 50 meters radius of the location . ie , cat(l ) = {v.category|distance(v , l ) ≤ 50m} , where , v represents venue . Empirically , we found that each location gets associated with approximately k categories . The average value of k for the three datasets ie FourSquare ( Mar’10Jan’11 ) , FourSquare ( Jan’11 Dec’11 ) and BrightKite ( Mar’08Oct’10 ) is 22 , 13 and 9 , respectively . 2.2 Data Modelling
We denote the set of categories associated with a location l as Cl . If the last location is l , we find a likely category c for l . Then we determine a category c that is likely to be followed after c ( for example , restaurant after cinema ) . Lastly , we find a location l that is likely for the category c . This is aggregated over multiple values for c and c to associate a probability with each value of l , as follows :
PC ( l ) =
Pu(l|c).(α∗ Pu(c|c
) + ( 1− α)∗ Pg(c|c
)).P ( c
|l
) , c,c
( 1 ) where Pu(c|c ) and Pg(c|c ) denote the probability of the user visiting a location of category c right after visiting one of category c , as estimated using the user ’s own check in history , and the global check in history across all users respectively . α is an interpolation parameter that determines the relative weighting of Pu and Pg . We estimate P ( c|l ) and P ( l|c ) as follows :
|l
) =
P ( c number of venues of category c close to l total number of venues close to l
P ( l|c ) = number of venues of category c close to l loc number of venues of category c close to loc We will call PC ( . ) as the category language model location prediction method ; as in the case of other models , once this distribution is estimated , the most probable location could be recommended . 2.3 Leveraging Category Language Model ( CLM )
Using just the CLM for location prediction is not likely to be effective since it does not model other aspects of user movement . Thus , we devise a method to leverage CLM with
SHM+T [ 2 ] , a state of the art model for location prediction that uses social , historical and temporal information . The SHM+T model may be simplistically represented as a function P ( l|t , Hu,t , Su,t ) that estimates a probability distribution of next location using : ( 1 ) t , the time of the day and week , ( 2 ) Hu,t , the user ’s check in history and ( 3 ) , Su,t , the user ’s social circle .
We combine SHM+T and CLM by estimating the combined distribution as a weighted sum of the distributions by the individual models , with the relative weighting determined by λ as follows : PSHM +T +CLM ( l ) = λ∗P ( l|t , Hu,t , Su,t)+(1−λ)∗PC ( l ) ( 2 )
3 . EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
Implementation Details : We have tested the proposed model over all the users who have made at least 10 checkins . For each test user , we divide her checkin history into 4:1 , where 80 % of checkins are used for training and rest 20 % are used for testing . Note that , checkins are sorted chronologically . Accuracy is used as the evaluation metric . Results are reported in table 2 . T in table 2 denotes the periodic patterns ie Daily(D ) , Weekly(W ) and DailyWeekly(DW ) . For CLM and SHM+T+CLM model , α = 0.6 and λ = 0.7 ( in equations 1 and 2 respectively ) are used . At these values we obtain the best performance . It can be observed that SHM+T+CLM achieves 1 2 % of improvement over SHM+T , that is similar to quantum of improvement that SHM+T has achieved over SHM in [ 2 ] .
4 . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper , we have inferred coarse grained category information and have leveraged this information for enhancing the performance of the existing state of the art methods for next checkin location prediction . In continuation of this work , we would like to explore other auxiliary information such as text information ( reviews ) that can be used to improve the current state of the art .
