ABSTRACT Opinion mining is an important research topic in data mining . Many current methods are coarse grained , which are practically problemic due to insufficient feedback information and limited reference values . To address these problems , a novel topic and sentiment unification maximum entropy LDA model is proposed in this paper for fine grained opinion mining of online reviews . In this model , a maximum entropy component is first added to the traditional LDA model to distinguish background words , aspect words and opinion words and further realize both the local and global extraction of these words . A sentiment layer is then inserted between a topic layer and a word layer to extend the proposed model to four layers . Sentiment polarity analysis is done based on the extraction of aspect words and opinion words to simultaneously acquire the sentiment polarity of the whole review and each topic , which leads to , fine grained topic sentiment abstract . Experimental results demonstrate the validity of the proposed model and theory .

INTRODUCTION With the development of the Internet , tens of thousands of users began to purchase various products and services through the network and publish the related online reviews . Analysis of these reviews can not only help potential customers make an intelligent decision , but also guide enterprises to timely improve the quality

ACM 978 1 4503 3473 0/15/05 . http://dxdoiorg/101145/27409082741704 of their products and services . However , the number of online reviews is enormous , which is impractical , if not impossible , to use traditional manual methods for fast access . Therefore , it has been an important research topic for researchers to develop opinion mining of online reviews through automatic analyzing and extracting methods . Current studies [ 1 3 ] showed that review opinion mining mainly included the following tasks : ( 1 ) extracting the aspect and opinion words ; ( 2 ) sentimental classification and polarity analysis ; and ( 3 ) generating sentiment abstract . In addition , in terms of the granularity , current methods mainly focused on three levels : word or phrase level , sentence level , and chapter level . Previous efforts on opinion mining focused on sentiment classification on chapter and sentence levels . Pang et al . [ 4 5 ] firstly made a series of studies about polarity classification . Three classifiers , Naive Bayes Model ( NBM ) , Maximum Entropy Model ( MaxEnt ) , and Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) , were mainly used [ 4 ] . Graph based minimum cut approach was adopted to identify the subjectivity and objectivity of sentences in [ 5 ] . Ni et al . [ 6 ] employed NBM , SVM , and Roechio's algorithm to make text sentiment classification . Information Gain and CHI were also used to select features [ 6 ] . Nevertheless , the aforementioned studies are all coarse grained methods , where only the overall sentiment polarity can be derived [ 7 ] . In practical reviews , consumers usually hold different sentiment opinion towards different topics . It is more helpful for potential consumers to simultaneously acquire the overall and specific comments of products or services . In this context , traditional opinion mining methods were unable to meet the practical needs and consequently , fine grained methods emerge as an alternative , which sentiment classification on word or phrase level . Another issue in sentiment analysis is that the same word may have distinct sentiment orientations in the contexts with different topics . For example , the word "simple" is positive in the sentence "The restaurant has simple tones" , which means that the restaurant style is simple and elegant . However , it is negative in the sentence "The food tastes simple" , which denotes poor food taste . Therefore , it is essential to integrate the context with topics in sentiment analysis . In recent years , many scholars applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation model ( LDA ) to opinion mining . Standard LDA is a bag of word model , which assumes that a document is a set of independent words . Locations and semantic information of words are not considered in the model . Thus , it is not appropriate for word involves more specific
649 extraction in fine grained methods [ 8 ] . Some researchers extended LDA model and generated topic or sentiment labels on sentence level [ 9 10 ] , which had achieved good performance . In this paper , a topic and sentiment unification maximum entropy LDA model ( TSU MaxEnt LDA ) is proposed for fine grained opinion mining . Topics and sentiments are simultaneously considered on word or phrase level to get more specific sentiment polarity analysis . In Section 2 , we briefly review some related work . This is followed by the proposed work in Section 3 . In Section 4 , we present some experimental results . 2 . RELATED WORK LDA and extended work played a significant role in opinion mining research . Titov et al . [ 8 ] presented Multi Grain LDA model ( MG LDA ) and Multi Aspect Sentiment model ( MAS ) . Brody et al . [ 9 ] extended LDA to Local LDA on sentence level . Experiments showed that these three models were very useful for the extraction of topics , which could acquire both global aspect words and local aspect words . Nevertheless , aspect words and opinion words were not distinguished in these models , which would lead to low accuracy of sentiment analysis . To overcome the shortcomings of standard LDA in extraction of fine grained features , Zhao et al . [ 10 ] added a maximum entropy ( MaxEnt ) component in LDA models and proposed a MaxEntLDA model . Considering the location and semantic information of words , two indicator variables were introduced to distinguish local and global aspect words and opinion words . Topics were generated on sentence level . In this case , words had the same topic with their sentences . However , sentiment analysis was not involved in their research . Mei et al . [ 11 ] proposed Topic Sentiment Mixture model ( TSM ) in which topic and sentiment were separated from each other by assuming topic identification . In realistic applications , however , this assumption does not hold as sentiment words are an important part to express topic . A Joint Sentiment/Topic model ( JST ) was presented in [ 12 ] to sample topic and sentiment labels for each word . JST adopted standard LDA , which was not suitable for fine grained feature extraction . Based on JST , Jo et al . [ 13 ] proposed Aspect Sentiment Unification Model ( ASUM ) . Different from JST , the location and semantic information of words were considered in ASUM for sampling topic and sentiment labels . However , the two models all made sentiment analysis on the whole review level , which could not obtain more fine grained sentiment polarity . Through inserting sentiment layer between topic layer and word layer , Li et al . [ 14 ] proposed Sentiment LDA to extend traditional LDA from three layer to four layer . The sentiment polarities of the whole review and each topic were simultaneously obtained . However , this model still adopted bag of word structure . Considering the aforementioned disadvantages , TSU MaxEntLDA is proposed in this paper for fine grained opinion mining . Referring to MaxEnt LDA and considering location and semantic information of words , maximum entropy component is added in TSU MaxEnt LDA . A sentiment layer is inserted between topic layer and word layer to extend the proposed model from traditional three layers to four layers . Under the assumption that each sentence just belongs to one topic and one sentiment , sentiment polarity analysis is done based on the extraction of that sentiment words had no impact on aspect words and opinion words to simultaneously acquire the sentiment polarity of the whole review and each topic . Finally , fine grained topic sentiment abstract can be extracted . 3 . TSU MAXENT LDA DESCRIPTIONS The following example is used to describe the terminology of TSU MaxEnt LDA . “ The food is great . The salad is delicious . The waiter is quite friendly . The staff is great . Beijing restaurant is great . The restaurant has simple tones . The food tastes simple . ” In this review , “ delicious ” and “ salad ” have strong association , so do “ friendly ” and “ waiter ” . Local opinion words “ delicious ” and “ friendly ” can be used to modify local aspect words “ salad ” ( an aspect of topic “ food ” ) and “ waiter ” ( an aspect of topic “ staff ” ) . Global aspect words are collective nouns denoting distinguished products or service entity , such as “ Beijing Restaurant ” and “ Hilton Restaurant ” in “ restaurant ” domain . Global opinion words , like “ great ” , are usually used to modify various topics and global aspect words , such as food , staff and Beijing restaurant . Background words are used to connect aspect and opinion words . Global words and background words have higher occurrence ratio than local words , which will disturb the identification of local words . Compared with the comments of the whole review , potential consumers prefer to obtain the evaluation of specific aspects . Therefore , local words should be solely identified . Furthermore , opinion word “ simple ” is positive in the sentence “ The restaurant has simple tones ” , which means that the restaurant style is elegant . However , it is negative in the sentence “ The food tastes simple ” , which indicates bland food . Hence , sentiment orientation is dependent on topics and a same word may have different sentiment polarities in different cases . In this paper , we assume that each sentence just belongs to one topic and sentiment and each word has same topic and sentiment with its sentence . In sentiment classification , we consider two kinds of sentiment orientations ( positive and negative ) and take the sentiment polarity with bigger probability value . 3.1 Generating Process of TSU MaxEnt LDA TSU MaxEnt LDA It incorporates both topic and sentiment , which is shown in Figure 1 . Maximum entropy component is added in TSU MaxEnt LDA to distinguish background words , aspect words and opinion words and further realize both the local and global extraction of these words . Two indicator variables , y and u , are introduced to distinguish word categories ( {0(cid:712)1(cid:712)2} , where 0 : background word , 1 : aspect word , 2 : opinion word ) and word types ( {0(cid:712)1} 0 : local , 1 : global ) . The Meanings of notations are listed in Table 1 . In TSU MaxEnt LDA , the generative process is as follows . 1 . For a corpus , ( 1 ) Draw word distributions Φ~ Dir(β ) ( background word : ΦB , global aspect word : ΦA,g , global opinion word : {ΦO,g,s} , local aspect word : {ΦA,t,s} , local opinion word : {ΦO,t,s} ( s=0 , 1 t=1(cid:712)(cid:712)T ) ( 2 ) Draw word type distribution ρ ~ Beta(η ) . 2 . For each document d in the corpus , ( 1 ) Draw the document ’s topic distribution θd ~Dir(α ) . is an extension of MaxEnt LDA .

( 3 ) Choose a word category yd,m,n from a multinomial distribution over {0(cid:712)1(cid:712)2} parameterized by xd,m,n . How to set xd,m,n will be discussed in Section 32 ( 4 ) Generate wd,m,n as follows : ) st,A ,
­ ° ° ° ® ° ° ° ¯ 3.2 Inference Researches [ 9 10 , 15 16 ] have shown that simple POS features are very effective for distinguishing aspect words and opinion words . In MaxEnt LDA , they used previous , current and next POS tags features . Similar to MaxEnt LDA , we also use a maximum entropy model in TSU MaxEnt LDA and apply it to the feature vector fd,m,n of wd,m,n to set xd,m,n . Different from method in [ 10 ] , we regroup POS features and select features as follows : {POSi 1,POSi,POSi+1,POSi 1POSi,POSiPOSi+1,POSi 1POSiPOSi+1} . The feature of wd,m,n is denoted as fd,m,n={posn 1,posn,posn+1,posn 1posn,posnposn+1,posn 1posnposn+1} . Then we can get λl of fd,m,n from MaxEnt model which is trained by a set of training sentences with labeled background , aspect and opinion word . can be obtained from the following equation . nm,d , lx nm,d ,

652 4 . EXPERIMENTS In this paper , we use the same data set as Brody and Zhao did in [ 9 , 10 ] , which originates from [ 7 , 18 , 19 ] . Similar to their methods , we manually annotate 50 sentences for training the MaxEnt model . When pre processing the data , we remove stop words and use Standford POS Tagger [ 20 ] to tag the data set . We also back up an original data version for extracting the contextual features . Referring to the parameter setting in [ 10 , 13 , 21 ] , we use Gibbs sampling and set parameters as follows : iterating times=500 , α=50/T ( cid:712 ) β=0.1 ( cid:712 ) γ=1 ( cid:712 ) ( cid:168)=0.5 , where γ is symmetric and γ=1means all sentiment distributions have the same probability . This kind of parameter setting is proved by experiments to reach the best performance .
Similar to the experimental methods in [ 7 , 9 , 10 ] , the number of topics is set as T=14 and we manually classify them into six topics ( Food , Service , Price , Ambience , Anecdotes , Miscellaneous ) from which three major topics ( Staff , Food , and Ambience ) are selected for evaluating the performance of TSU MaxEnt LDA model . In the experiments , we firstly distinguish aspect words and opinion words . Based on this , the local and global extraction of these words is realized . Then sentiment polarity classification of TSU MaxEnt LDA is done and topic sentiment abstract can be concluded , which is shown in Table 3 ( P : probability of positive sentiment , N : probability of negative sentiment ) . The sampling results of aspect words and opinion words in MaxEnt LDA are shown in Table 4 . The two tables all select the top 10 words for corresponding topic .

653 From table 3 , we can see that local aspect words under each topic are quite representative and coherent and local opinion words under each topic highly accord with corresponding topics . Furthermore , the global opinion words and aspect words are all correctly clustered under the corresponding categories . Comparing Table 3 with Table 4 , we can see that the extraction results of aspect words and opinion words are similar . However , there is not sentiment classification in Table 4 . Obviously , adding sentiment component into TSU MaxEnt LDA model makes the classification results in Table 3 more informative and helpful for users . The quantitative evaluation method of the sentiment orientation in [ 14 ] is used to analyze the overall sentiment of reviews . We calculate the accuracy to judge the validity of overall sentiment analysis through the following equation : c N totalN
Accuracy
. totalN where Nc is the number of correctly predicted reviews , is the total number of reviews . The accuracy values of TSU MaxEntLDA , ASUM [ 13 ] , and Sentiment LDA [ 14 ] are shown in Table 5 . Sentiment LDA and ASUM all added sentiment seed words which interfered with the experimental results . Hence , the sentiment seed words are not adopted in our experiments . We can see that TSU MaxEnt LDA achieves the highest accuracy among three models . It is more effective of our model to sample topic and sentiment label for each sentence than of Sentiment LDA to sample topic and sentiment label for each word . In addition , over 80 % of the labeled sentences in the data set [ 7 ] have one topic and sentiment label , which confirms our assumption that a sentence usually belongs to an aspect and a sentiment . Compared with ASUM , both TSU MaxEnt LDA and Sentiment LDA obtain more fine grained sentiment distribution of topics and reach higher sentiment classification accuracy .
