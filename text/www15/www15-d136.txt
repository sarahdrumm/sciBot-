ABSTRACT People around the world use social media platforms such as Twitter to express their opinion about various aspects of daily life . In the same way social media changes communication in daily life , it also is transforming the way individuals communicate during disasters and emergencies . Emergency officials have come to rely on social media to communicate alerts and updates . How do users communicate risk on social media ? We used a novel information theoretic unsupervised learning tool , CorEx , to extract and classify highly relevant words used by the public on Twitter during known emergencies , such as fires , explosions , and hurricanes . By utilizing the resulting classification strategy , authorities may be able to use the derived language to craft more relevant risk communication to maximize the propagation of short message broadcasts such as the Wireless Emergency Alerts ( WEA ) service .

INTRODUCTION
The ability to clearly communicate between the public and those responsible for assessing , minimizing , and regulating risks is critical for successful resolution of a public emergency . Strong safety concerns cause the public to develop symptoms of emotional and behavioral distress that adversely affect the perception of risk during a crisis through the evocation of strong emotions such as fear , anxiety , distrust , anger , outrage , helplessness , and frustration[6 ] . Understanding the dynamics of risk perception during a crisis is crucial for successful emergency response because ultimately people act on the basis of what they believe to be true . Perceived risk is known to have a stronger impact on disaster recovery and preparedness than actual risk as communicated by emergency public information officers . For example , a recent study on risk communication shows households in America are more strongly motivated to prepare for terrorism and other hazards by observing preparations taken by others than they are by information received from preparedness information providers[16 ] . Although public officials depend on precision and clarity , how do they properly tailor their communication for a public using a different lexicon ? The present work presents automated content analysis methods to analyze social media to provide tools to study language used during emergencies , helping to ensure effective communication of risk and of how to mitigate danger in emergencies .
The adoption of risk communication strategies that promote trust , credibility , effectiveness , abidance of moral and ethical values , respect , and timeliness can greatly minimize risk perception biases by reducing public emotional and behavioral distress , whether the emergency concerns disease control[15 , 14 , 1 ] , natural/manmade disasters ( for example , [ 7] ) , or terrorism ( [5 , 4] ) . Because risk perception is also regulated by social identity factors[8 , 11 , 10 ] , adopting effective risk communication strategies that promote trust , credibility , etc . requires due attention to cultural differences that characterize diverse populations including persons with functional and access needs , transients/tourists , elderly/older adults , isolated/rural populations , institutional populations , and non English speaking people .
Over the past few years , short messages have been used in various forms for disaster related risk communication . The multistage developmental process for risk communication that is discussed by Fischhoff[9 ] is still relevant to short messages and the new generation of communication media . One notable instance was the use of social media to communicate warning messages during the 2008 terror attack in Mumbai ,
India . The consensus of review articles is that social media is not just a new means to carry out an old risk communication strategy[3 , 4 , 12 , 18 , 17 ] . However , language use varies widely , depending on proximity to the disaster , both geographic and experiential[13 ] . Here , we present a new strategy for analyzing tweets during an emergency to understand how language is being used and which words help communicate latent factors . By analyzing the mutual information between words within a tweet and the extracted latent variables , we show that each type of disaster has a characteristic lexicon which is often surprisingly different from how the same words are used in typical tweets outside of emergencies .
2 . METHODS 2.1 Data
Social media is understood as an information propagation tool for reporting on and responding to natural disasters . Emergency management services use social media to issue alerts and warnings , look for reports of emergencies , and understand public response to emergencies . Social media is used to share information leading up to , during , and after the disasters[2 ] . For the purposes of this study , tweets around a set of well known and documented disasters were gathered for examination .
To collect pertinent disaster related tweets , we used 203 US Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) declared disasters in the United States from 2012 and 2013 ( http://wwwfemagov/disasters ) Historical Twitter data was obtained from Gnip , a provider of the Twitter firehose , using their historical data request API . Each query was composed of curated keyword lists , primarily named entities related to a particular disaster and informal language describing the nature of the event . Queries were further filtered both by geo tagged location and date range . A date range for the historical query was selected by taking a range of ±5 days from the event date itself , except for the ( non weatherrelated ) Alamo , Calif . , gas leak , where a date range of +5 days and 1 day around the event date was used . Example keywords used for the Alamo , Calif . , gas leak included the following : leak , gas , evacuation , pg&e , pge , pg+e , alamo , danville , and shelter . Geographical filters for the query were established using the area of impact of the emergency declaration , such as a single 25 mile radius around a defined point , or entire regions were selected when more than a single point of impact exists . For example , Southern California flooding and wildfires searched within California , Hurricane Sandy covered multiple states , and the Alamo gas leak was a single point centered on Alamo , Calif .
Upon acquisition of this data , it was ingested into Elasticsearch , a Lucene based search engine architecture . Messages matching specific query parameters are marked by the vendor as belonging to a specific query set , allowing the messages for all disasters to be stored in a single index and simply filtered for content . A sample of the queries are listed in Table 1 , and the complete list is available on request . It is important to note that the nature of collecting only geotagged tweets means that we did not collect the subsequent retweets , but many people retweeted non geocoded tweets and embedded their own geocode .
To generate a control group , we also randomly selected 50,000 tweets with geo tags collected from the Twitter sprinkler between April and May 2014 . This control group , which may or may not contain any disaster specific tweets , allow us to compare how the risk corpus is used outside of emergency scenarios . 2.2 Risk Corpus
To analyze how people communicate during crises , we hand curated a list of words based on how users actually communicated on Twitter . The relevant geocoded tweets for each disaster were obtained as described in the data section . This collection of tweets was then used to curate a “ risk corpus ” of 292 words or expressions identified to be ( at least partially ) relevant to any of the disaster responses . This particular risk corpus was not meant to be definitive , and future work will focus on optimizing the breadth of the corpus and refining feature selection . Although many of the words may not be specific to commonly held notions of risk , we designed the corpus to encompass many of the ways users communicate fear , intent , targets , and the issues inducing the risk ( ie , the emergency events themselves ) . 2.3 Clustering
Each item of the corpus was converted into a regular expression to capture common variants and avoid ambiguity . For example , the words smolder and smoldering were represented as smold . Variants of “ fire ” can be expressed as fire(?!(work|fi) ) , to avoid tagging fireworks or firefighters as variant of fire , which were searched for separately . The complete list is shown in Appendix A . The resulting crisis related world list alone does not capture how risk is communicated by the public . One would have to identify informative subsets of these words to make sense of the general structure of the risk context conveyed by the public in the tweets . In order to obtain more relevant semantic clustering , we employed Correlation Explanation ( CorEx)[20 ] . CorEx searches for latent variables that explain correlation between the usages of different terms .

A reduced subset of 50,000 tweets was randomly sampled for each disaster type for the final analysis . Some disasters had less than 50,000 tweets , and as many as possible were selected . Each tweet was converted into a vector , X , where Xi is the presence ( or absence ) of regular expression i in the tweet . For each type of disaster , we used CorEx to generate a tree of latent variables where each variable is constructed to maximally explain the correlations in its children . That is , we simultaneously search over latent variables , Yj , j = j T C(XGj ; Yj ) is maximized . T C represents the amount of correlation in a group of variables , XGj , that is explained by Yj , and is specM I(Xi ; Yj ) − M I(XGj ; Yj ) , where M I(X ; Y ) is the mutual information between X and Y . For a group of uncorrelated Xi ’s , for instance , this expression would give zero , while it would be maximized if all the variables were identical copies . To construct a tree , we take the Y ( n−1 ) ’s learned on one level and apply CorEx again to learn a representation , Y ( n ) [ 20 ] . A detail of a sample tree is shown in Figure 1 . i∈Gj
The CorEx algorithm provides a tree of latent variables explaining correlation in the data , but it does not provide explicit labels for the latent variables . To label the latent variable nodes of the tree , we propagated up the tree the corpus entries with the highest weight according to the mutual information between the label and the latent variable to be labeled .

3 . DISCUSSION
The CorEx technique succeeds at identifying both disasterspecific themes as well as how word usage changes during emergencies . As we see in Figures 1 and 2 , the resulting trees are largely dominated by terms commonly used in disaster alerts . For the control tweets , the CorEx analysis produces very different clustering , implying different latent variables underlie the use of risk related terms outside of emergency situations . For example , during fire events , the words “ fire ” and “ firework ” are closely associated , but this is not true outside of fire events . Similarly , outside of disaster events , the CorEx generates labels such as “ hot/cold ” , “ hours/minutes ” , “ rain/sunny ” , and ” char/destroy , ” as in Figure 1(c ) . During disasters , CorEx tends to identify combinations which are more mutually predictive , such as “ power/loss ” , “ evacuation/county ” , and “ issued/until . ” Thus , we conclude that the resulting lexical analysis is specific to how users respond to disasters and not simply generic relations resulting from artifacts of the hand curated corpus .
Our results show that tweets tend to focus on announcing the emergency , advising others , or describing the damage . Other obvious clusters include expressions of anxiety , frustration , and expletives . The CorEx results enable us to show which words in the corpus are most predictive of the latent feature , and thus may communicate the intent of the latent feature most clearly . For each type of disaster , we have produced a list of words that best communicate the latent variables . That is , for each feature Xi , there is a mutual information with each latent variable Yj . High mutual information implies high explanatory power , and for each type of disasters we present a list of words that have the most explanatory power in each scenario . Because Yi represent the latent variable which explains the co occurence of words below it in the tree , having high M I(Xi ; Yj ) means that feature Xi also helps explain why other words are used in combination with it in that disaster scenario . We present a brief list of the most and least informative words for each type of disaster in Table 2 . 3.1 Most Informative and Surprising Tweets The present CorEx technique enables us to analyze each tweet to determine how it is using words from the corpus of risk words . We score each tweet by summing its total correlation with respect to each latent variable for that disaster type . Low scoring tweets utilize combinations of words in unexpected ways and often do a poor job at communicating intent . Words that are highly predictive of particular latent variables ( and therefore other words ) , will generally produce “ unsurprising ” tweets . That is , although the content may refer to a surprising event ( tornado , explosion , etc. ) , the reader should be able to easily interpret how all the terms come together to communicate the inferred latent variable . For example , emergency alerts or discussions of the consequences of disasters tend to be highly informative and unsurprising , while passing comments or references tend to be uninformative and surprising , from our current total correlation perspective . As a control group , we analyzed random geocoded tweets , and we observe the risk corpus flags official National Weather Service ( NWS ) alerts as highly relevant outside of emergencies , but during emergencies , the most informative tweets tend to less formal and more emotional than random sample . 311 Randomly Sampled Tweets Most Information/Least Surprising • 50560 : severe thunderstorm warning issued may 08 at 2:03pm cdt until may 08 at 2:30pm cdt by nws desmoines http://tco/ . . • 56065 : severe thunderstorm warning issued may 07 at 9:20pm cdt until may 07 at 10:15pm cdt by nws minneapolis http://tco/ . . • 65326 : flash flood warning issued april 03 at 4:01pm cdt until april 03 at 10:00pm cdt by nws springfield http://tco/ . . • 09:26 bst : temperature : 10.1◦c , wind : ssw , 0 mph ( ave ) , 2 mph ( gust ) , humidity : 89 % , rain ( hourly ) 0.0 mm , pressure : 1015 hpa , rising slowly • 00:33 bst : temperature : 10.2◦c , wind : s , 0 mph ( ave ) , 0 mph ( gust ) , humidity : 82 % , rain ( hourly ) 0.0 mm , pressure : 1004 hpa , rising slowly

4 . CONCLUSIONS
The CorEx analysis provides us a tool to extract useful ways to communicate with the public based on a risk corpus , using language already being used on social networks today . By extracting latent variables , we are revealing how words are used together to communicate coherent messages , and we are able to quantify the latent content of each tweet . That is , each latent variable we identify helps to explain the mutual occurrence of words from the corpus in each tweet . In addition to being a useful clustering tool , the CorEx analysis provides us with a dimensionality reduction by mapping each tweet into a vector of probabilities for representing each of the latent variables . Although we applied the same risk corpus to analyze many types of disasters , words and phrases convey information specific to each type of emergency event . Thus , CorEx and similar analysis can be used to characterize tweet construction , which may help for constructing emergency announcements . Tan et al . have shown that messages that conform to the community norm have greater propagation through a network [ 19 ] . Given this , our work proposes a method for measuring lexical choices against conformity to a norm . In a larger context , one can imagine a scenario where a candidate population is selected ; communication in that community is encoded , and then that measurement is used to inform your word selection to increase information propagation .
Future work will quantitatively relate the techniques presented here to observed disaster responses , both in the real world and in controlled experiments . By relating CorEx classification to social media penetration ( for example , retweets ) , we can examine how much fear/doubt exists , compare wordof mouth advice to official notices , and track if any “ bad advice ” is spreading .
