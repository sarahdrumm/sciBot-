ABSTRACT Among many types of online games , Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games ( MMORPGs ) provide players with the most realistic gaming experience inspired by the real , offline world . In particular , much stress is put upon socializing and collaboration with others as a condition for one ’s success , just as in real life . An advantage of studying MMORPGs is that since all actions are recorded , we can observe phenomena that are hard to observe in real life . For instance , we could observe how the allimportant collaboration between people come into being , evolve , and eventually die out from the data to gain valuable insights to the group dynamics . In this paper , we analyzed the successes and failures of the online game groups in two different MMORPG , ArcheAge of XLGames , Inc . and Aion of NCsoft , Inc We find that there exist factors that influence the dynamics of group growth common to the games regardless of the games’ maturity .

There are many online social networks ( eg Facebook , Twitter ) on the Internet . They have become the most comprehensive and useful human behavior data analysis platforms ; they , however , are limited in terms of what we can observe from the full set of complex human behaviors .

Among many online social platforms , online games , especially MMORPGs are the most similar to the real world . They provide a variety of actions ( befriending , treasure hunts , item trading , and community joining ) for the players to enjoy [ 2 ] . By analyzing these action logs , we can observe multi relational interactions between humans . To this end , we focus on analyzing a group ( usually called as a community or guild in game ) in aspect of multi relational interactions in online game virtual world . In many games socializing and collaboration play an important role in the success inside a game , which is not at all different from how the real world works . Between users , they continuously influence each other by doing altruistic behaviors [ 3 , 4 ] or malicious behaviors [ 5 , 6 ] . These positive or negative influences affect the user ’s loyalty on the games . Like the personal relation , a user gets an influence from the belonged group . Furthermore , in real world or virtual world , we are all likely to become a member of various communities that define various aspects of our daily life , and we soon realize that many great achievements necessitate well executed collaborations . For this reason , the rise and fall of social groups have long been the focus of social science research . In our previous work [ 7 ] , we found that in the early stages of a game ( ArcheAge ) ’s adoption the prospect for benefits to a user is more important for a group ’s growth than any sense of loyalty . Based on our observations , these following findings are the most significant factors to affect a guild ’s birth and growth .
Findings 1 : People tend to join guilds when they expect that tangible benefits ( game money or valuable items ) . To gain these money and items , they collaborate intensively by doing castle sieges or raid quest between users .
Findings 2 : Users switch guild membership to gain more profit ( that is , strong guild is getting stronger , weak guild is getting weaker ) . Based on these findings , we concluded that users firstly consider personal profit than social loyalty . Finally we concluded the social actions that can lead to an increase in an individual ’s profit are one of the significant factors that affect a guild ’s rise and fall ( strengthening and expanding the lifetime of the guilds ) . However , ArcheAge is in the early stage of online virtual community not mature , therefore , to see if any difference exists
1079 between a game in its early stage and another that is considered mature , we encompass our analysis toward Aion , a more mature MMORPG , in a similar fashion and present the findings here . 1.2   Contributions The contributions of this work are as follows .   We performed the comparative analysis in two different games , ArcheAge and Aion . They are in the same genre ( MMORPG ) but the maturity is different . ArcheAge is in the beginning stage , and Aion is in mature stage . As far as we know , this research is the first one to perform comparative analysis between major MMORPGs by analyzing big dataset . This research can be used for a game system design to enforce user ’s feeling of belongingness in the virtual society . Finally , that can affect the guild ’s longevity and user ’s satisfaction positively . 2 .   RELATED WORK We broadly classify current research activity on social groups into four categories , as shown in Table 1 .

Ning communitie s World of Warcraft DBLP , IMDB , BLOGS , WIKI Article Mobile phone call Email , Portal Online community publications users from the World of Warcraft data . They found that that past loyalty , group stability , and social engagement were the most relevant factors for predicting the probability of quitting a guild . Kawale et al . [ 9 ] studied the phenomenon of churning in EverQuest II . They proposed a churn prediction model based on their examination of social influence among players and their levels of personal engagement in the game . The researches in Social Action category used the degree of trust in the community and social interactions . Hsiao and Chiou [ 10 ] investigated how players’ positions in an online game group affected their intention to continue playing an MMORPG . They provided support for the moderating effects of gaming knowledge and community size on the proposed model . Due to measure the impact of social capital , they selected seven features ( ie , community position , community trust , social value , intentions to continue the MMOG , knowledge of the game , membership duration , and average play time ) . Chung et al . [ 11 ] analyzed the characteristics of Aion groups from a socio economic viewpoint . They found that growing groups exhibit more cohesive social interactions and balanced communication patterns . The researches in Group Structure category dealt with structural features such as the size and density of the group . Kairam et al . [ 12 ] studied group growth via diffusion and non diffusion during a group ’s formative stages from the perspective of individuals and groups . They reported that past growth features predicted the short term growth more accurately , whereas structural features of the network predicted the long term growth for smaller groups . They demonstrated that group clustering encouraged diffusion growth , and groups that grew more via diffusion tended to reach a smaller size . Ducheneaut et al . [ 13 ] found factors that described the success or failure of a gaming guild using data collected from the World of Warcraft . They claimed that expanding a guild while partitioning the members into small , balanced subgroups ( in terms of class and levels ) was good for accomplishing missions and clearing dungeons . Goldberg et al . [ 14 ] proposed an algorithmic framework for studying the evolution of communities in social networks . They identified that the lifespan of a community relates to structural parameters that were correlated with the early evolution of that density , intersection , and core size were significantly related with the lifespan of a group . Lastly , the researches in Group Lifecycle category studied the birth , growth , decline , and demise of the groups . Palla et al . [ 15 ] identified the statistical properties of evolving groups through time . They formulated their analysis based on outstanding events in the evolution of a mobile phone network group , including growth , contraction , merger , splitting , creation , and destruction of the group . They demonstrated that large groups persisted longer if they were capable of dynamically altering their membership , while small and stationary community generally underwent minor changes but survived longer . Brodka et al . [ 16 ] attempted to predict the pattern of group evolution in e mail communication and portal communities . Using a simple sequence of several preceding groups’ sizes and events as an input for the classifier , they showed that decision trees and random forest were often the most accurate classifiers . Iriberri and Leroy [ 17 ] reviewed research on online communities , and organized the factors of success based on the lifecycles of information systems and the community that different technology the developmental stage of the online community . They reviewed studies from such various fields as computer science , sociology , type and genre . They proposed features the community . They showed are necessary depending on
1080 management science , psychology , information systems , etc They presented the benefits of an online community to the individuals therein . They also classified the factors of success for each stage in the lifecycle of online systems ( Inception , Creation , Growth , Maturity , and Death ) .
3 .   MATERIALS AND METHODS 3.1   Group Dynamics In our previous work [ 7 ] , we found that gamers are motivated more by benefit than by loyalty in choosing guild and community memberships in an MMORPG ArcheAge . As a result , game actions that can benefit the users become significant for the group ’s growth . We applied the same methodology to user behaviors observed in a mature game , Aion . The basic statistics of the two games and data are given in Table 2 . ArcheAge ’s beta test was launched in South Korea on December 8 , 2011 ; Aion was released in South Korea on November 25 , 2008 . guild ’s level can increase when some conditions are met , eg the guild size , co play frequency between guild members , and the amount of cyber assets collected . Guild members can also benefit ( eg , gain experience points ) when the guild achieves a higher level . When users create a guild , users begin at rank 1 , and the guild can have up to maximum 30 members . Upon reaching the size of ten members , users may choose to upgrade their guild to rank 2 for a fee . Rank 2 can have up to 60 members . By contrast , a guild in ArcheAge needs at least five players above level 5 to exist . A group of users can ask NPC guild managers to create a guild for them after paying some money . Guild members usually participate in hunting and siege wars together to gain more experience points . Some minor differences exist , although the purpose of a guild and main benefits are common between the two games .

3.2   Group Dynamics The ArcheAge dataset contains all in game logs for the period from December 8th of 2011 to February 25th of 2012 , which covers the entire period of the 4th Closed Beta Test ( CBT ) ; this makes the game world only 80 days old , allowing us to observe the group dynamics in a very young , yet to mature game . During this period , 224 guilds were formed , and of the 20,253 unique users who played the game 6,309 players joined a guild . The Aion dataset contains all of the in game logs for the period from April 10th of 2010 to June 28th of 2010 . This game was launched on November 2008 , making it more mature than ArcheAge . During this period , 1680 guilds were formed , and of the 85,891 unique users who played the game , 7,558 players joined a guild . Fig 1 shows the CDFs for the guild sizes found in ArcheAge and Aion . X axis represents the guild size ( measured by its maximum number of membership in an observational period ) , and Y axis represents the cumulative rate of guilds for the guild size . The differences likely stem from their conditions for guild creation and expansion . ArcheAge guilds comprise five members at a minimum , with no upper bounds ( as currently as 4th CBT test ) . Aion guilds comprise one member at a minimum , and has a level designation that limits the member numbers per level ( 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 members for guild level 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 , respectively ) . In ArcheAge , about 14 % of the guilds have more than 100 members , and the largest guild has 337 members . In Aion , about 14 % of the guilds have more than eight members , and the largest guild has 66 members . To create a guild , users just pay a creation fee to the guild administration office located in each race's capital . Aion guilds have level specification with varying benefits . A
Figure 1 . The membership size distribution of guilds in
ArcheAge ( blue ) and Aion ( red ) .
In general , the number of guild members is widely accepted as a success factor of guilds . In Fig 2(a ) and Fig 2(b ) , we show how the increase and the decrease in guild membership are correlated with group activities in ArcheAge . Fig 2(a ) shows the group actions ( party play [ 18 ] and siege [ 3 ] activities ) per day by the users joining guilds . In Fig 2(a ) , X axis represents the observational period by date . The colored section in Y axis and left most Y axis value represent the count of various group activities ( eg party creation , raid team creation , party join , and raid team join ) . The black colored curve and the right most Y axis value represent the cumulative number of members joined the group ( guild ) . Many new members correspond to many group actions . Likewise , Fig 2(b ) ’s X axis and left most value of Y axis represent the same thing . The black colored curve and the right most Y axis value represent the cumulative number of members leaving the group . That is , many leaving members correspond to many group actions as well . As shown in Fig 2(a ) and Fig 2(b ) , when the profit sharing from the group action ( such as party play and raid play ) are not satisfactory , then the users leave the belonged guild to join another more beneficial guilds . Therefore , the user ’s satisfaction from the group activities can affect the rise and fall of the groups .
1081 Figure 2 . ( a ) The cumulative number of people joining and the concurrent group actions frequencies in ArcheAge .
Figure 3 . ( b ) The cumulative number of people leaving the guilds and the concurrent group actions frequencies in Aion
Fig 4 shows the bar graphs of guild leave actions per user in ArcheAge and Aion . In ArcheAge , among 6,197 members 1,759 have left , and 464 of those have left guilds twice or more . In Aion the numbers are 7,758 and 2,059 . 586 have left guilds twice or more . The ratios of the number of withdrawals are almost identical in both games .
Figure 2 . ( b ) The cumulative number of people leaving the guilds and the concurrent group actions frequencies in
ArcheAge .
In Fig 3(a ) and Fig 3(b ) , we also find the same aspects of the increase and the decrease in guild membership is highly correlated with group activities in Aion . There were big spikes of party play events when a there is a prominent change in the guild membership . For the first time , we expect that social tie will be getting stronger in a mature game . However , users show the same behaviors when joining and leaving the group activities regardless of the games’ maturity ( number of users , number of guilds , game ’s age and economic maturity ) . That means the rise and fall of the online game groups are highly related to the group activities , and users make a decision based on their profit than loyalty .
Figure 3 . ( a ) The cumulative number of people joining and the concurrent group actions frequencies in Aion
Figure 4 . The frequency of withdrawal of the guild by players in ArcheAge ( top bar ) and Aion ( bottom bar ) .
Fig 5 shows the ratio of members who rejoin the same guild . In ArcheAge , 604 users out of 7,785 users rejoined a guild after withdrawal . About 30 % of these users did rejoin activities twice or more . In Aion , 681 users out of 1,236 users rejoined a guild after withdrawal . About 45 % of these users rejoined a guild twice or more . In our previous work on ArcheAge , we found that subgroups moved in tandem from their original guild to an allied guild for castle sieges and moved back to their original guild after they are over . The same phenomenon is observed in Aion regardless of the game ’s maturity . As the same , we firstly expect that Aion will be far from the frequent leaving and rejoining activities in the same guild ( because that looks like shameless profit seeking and loyalty less behaviors ) . However , the users’ behaviors are similar in overall . The friendship network is the most fundamental and common social network in MMORPGs . Users can become friends by adding each other to their Friend Lists . A cross analysis with the “ join guild ” action log enables us to see how the expansion of a guild correlates with the strength of the friendships between members . We conducted a study by analyzing two network transition phenomena , transition the guild to friend ie ,
1082 ( becoming friends after being affiliated with a common guild ) and the friend to guild transition ( becoming affiliated with a common guild after being friends ) .

Figure 7 . ( a ) The prevalence of distinct chat types in four representative guilds in ArcheAge .
In Fig 6 we show the order in which the users join guilds based on a sample study . Dark gray implies guild members becoming friends , while light gray implies friends joining a common guild . In ArcheAge , both are 40 60 % , meaning the ordering is not significant . In Aion , we observe a noticeably higher ratio of friends joining the same guild in Aion . Other observations in this paper show similar results between the two games , but ArcheAge and Aion show differences in the following aspect : In ArcheAge , friend to guild to guild to friend transition , while in Aion , friend to guild transition is more frequent than guild to friend transition . This likely stems from the restriction on the number of users that can join a guild in Aion . This appears to be the reason why the friend to guild transition is more frequent than the guild to friend transitions . is comparable transition

We also investigated whether there existed specific patterns in ingame chatting that correlated with the success of a guild . The results are shown in Fig 7(a ) and Fig 7(b ) , where we show the frequencies of each chatting type in four different guilds . Starting from the top and moving down , the four bars show the results for a guild that is large and old , a guild that is small and older , a guild that is small and young , and a guild that is large and young . In Fig 7(a ) , the membership sizes of the sample guilds in ArcheAge are 152 , 14 , 8 , and 61 , respectively . In Fig 7(b ) , the membership sizes of sample guilds in Aion are 60 , 10 , 11 , and 35 , respectively .
Figure 7 . ( b ) The prevalence of distinct chat types in four representative guilds in Aion . the that fact demonstrates
Fig 7(a ) and 7(b ) commonly show the prevalence of chat types depending on the guild size and age . The overall chatting type ratios are similar in both games . We see first that the guild that is small and young ( 3rd bar ) shows a lower fraction of guild chatting , which is the dominant chatting type ( about 30 % in ArcheAge and about 40 % in Aion ) in the other three guilds . This active communications occur during collective actions between guild members . In addition , these active communications are correlated strongly with the growth of the guild . We explore the overall trends found in four representative types of guilds in both games . However , we need to do a total inspection for all guilds as the future work to find another aspect not revealed yet . 4 .   Conclusions and Future Studies In our previous work , we found in the early stages of the game prospect for benefit are the more important factor in the group ’s growth than personal or social loyalty . We applied the same methodology to the mature game and determined that ArcheAge and Aion yield very similar results , showing that people ’s motivations are consistent regardless of the maturity of their environments . Our analysis also shows what users expect to gain from guilds . There are multiple advantages to belonging to a guild ; In general , users can do a party play with guild members who tend to be more cooperative than a random partner would be . Moreover , users can spend their time efficiently , as it can take a significant amount of time to find people to play with . Users can also obtain valuable information , as they often share knowledge based on their game experiences . Since cooperation between players of differing levels in a guild is common , lower levels can be more successful by playing inside the guild than alone , they can rise in level quickly , contributing to the success of the guild .
1083 A group leader can sometimes affect a group ’s performance significantly , and we find that a group leader ’s competence and commitment are indeed important in online guilds . Future research should focus more on the role of the social network in guilds . We plan to explore the changes in the friendship network , whisper network , trade network , and partyplay network in MMORPGs to build a prediction model of the rise and fall of guilds . 5 .   ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank XL Games , Inc . and NCsoft , Inc . for generously providing their data for use in this research .
