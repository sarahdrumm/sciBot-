ABSTRACT In this paper we examine WikiProjects , an emergent , communitydriven feature of Wikipedia . We analysed 3.2 million Wikipedia articles associated with 618 active Wikipedia projects . The dataset contained the logs of over 115 million article revisions and 15 million talk entries both representing the activity of 15 million unique Wikipedians altogether . Our analysis revealed that per WikiProject , the number of article and talk contributions are increasing , as are the number of new Wikipedians contributing to individual WikiProjects . Based on these findings we consider how studying Wikipedia from a sub community level may provide a means to measure Wikipedia activity .

INTRODUCTION
Wikipedia , the global online encyclopedia , has gained both academic and pubic attention given its role as a highly successful , collaboratively produced knowledge resource . However , despite its widely acknowledged value , questions have been raised about the state and health of Wikipedia , with the most recent findings suggesting a relatively small and decreasing number of contributors [ 14 ] , and the overall generation of new contributions may be in a state of decline [ 5 ] .
A decade after its launch , Wikipedia has managed to retain much of its technical core . Additionally , the system has witnessed several community led reformations of how the technical system is used to support and coordinate the work of the volunteer editors . One interesting feature are the more than 2,000 WikiProjects . Representing an attempt to improve the breadth and depth of Wikipedia articles in a multitude of specific domains , about one million Wikipedians are contributing to millions of Wikipedia pages by coordinating work via WikiProjects .
In this paper we examine if the emergent WikiProjects may provide an alternative perspective on understanding the general liveliness of Wikipedia activity . Our analysis is the first attempt to

We show that this is a promising new way of looking at Wikipedia , suggesting that a kind of knowledge saturation of the actual article contents upgrades the importance of coordination mechanisms such as WikiProjects for both , experiences editors as well as newcomers .
2 . BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK Wikipedia studies are varied , from examining the structure articles and contributors [ 13 ] , to the motivations , participation and demographics of contributors , to editing conflicts and disputes [ 7 ] , to barriers to adoption [ 6 ] . Efforts have been made to understand the collaborative process of article creation [ 8 ] , and devising methods to measure the quality of an article [ 1 ] . Studies have examined the dialogue and coordination of contributors in these environments [ 3 ] , and the role of discussion in the production of an article [ 4 , 10 ] , as well as facilitating communication with other editors [ 12 ] .
WikiProjects is a community driven feature that enables contributors to work together to create and improve articles , usually related to a specific area of interest or domain . There are no formal guidelines on how a WikiProject should be run , and there are no privileges for those contributing to a WikiProject . The articles which a WikiProject is contributing to is also part of the main corpus of Wikipedia articles , and can be part of more than one WikiProject . A WikiProject uses a specific template for its home ( root ) page . This template – developed by Wikipedians – resembles a typical Wikipedia article structure , but contains specific content related to a project , including , contributors , articles associated with , and the ‘project goal’ . Initial studies of WikiProjects have examined team coordination [ 11 ] , and motivation to contribute [ 2 ] .
3 . EXPERIMENT SETUP
This study analysed 1.6 million English Wikipedia article pages and their corresponding Talk page . We harvested over 3.2 million unique wiki pages , which are associated with 618 active WikiProjects . Although there are 2000 projects , only active WikiProjects marked by Wikipedia were harvested . In addition to the harvest of all Wikipedia articles and Talk pages associated with the 618 WikiProjects , we also harvested all the ’root’ pages , which are the homepage of the WikiProject .
We harvested all Wikipedia pages related to all 618 active WikiPro jects . For each Wikipedia page , we harvested the log of all edits . Each revision contained details of the user , time , and the change made . If the user was not registered , then the user ’s IP address is recorded , and ’anon’ is appended to the entry . We also extracted all corresponding ’Talk’ pages if available ( not all articles have a Talk page with entries ) . For each Talk entry , the user , the timestamp , and the comment made is stored . We then compute the growth of a project by constructing the timeseries of edits , talk entries , and new users since the earliest project page , relative to the first entry of the root project page .

4 . RESULTS AND FINDINGS
We compared the 618 WikiProjects with respect to the set of articles , Talk contributions , and users associated with a given WikiProject . As shown in Table 1 , we extracted users who have made entries on the ’root’ WikiProject page and also for the total set of pages related to a project .
Comparing the WikiProjects , we found a normal distribution with regards to the number of Wikipedians , articles and Talk pages , and found a positive correlation between the number of Talk entries ( for a Wikipedia in the root page ) and the number of articles edited . Unlike the main corpus of Wikipedia article [ 15 ] , the number of edit and talk contributions per user for root pages of a WikiProject , were more distributed , which may be due to type of content that these pages contained .
We computed the growth of each WikiProject in terms of the number of contributions , pages , and newly joined Wikipedians . Results in Table 2 show that WikiProjects follow a linear growth function ( article and Talk pages ) . The SD indicates that WikiProjects grow at a similar rate , which is also true for the set of root pages . In comparison to Suh et al . [ 14 ] and Halfaker et al . [ 5 ] , our findings suggest that based on the WikiProject activity , Wikipedia is not in decline , but still enjoying growth with new users , edits , and discussion activity . Akin to other complex online communities [ 9 ] , using traditional methods to measure community and system health may not reflect their true state ; instead , we need to develop novel techniques to examine the evolving social machinery of Wikipedia .
5 . CONCLUSION
Our study has shown that by using WikiProjects as a proxy for examining contribution and discussion activity , Wikipedia can be described as an active social machine with many thriving domain specific , sub communities . We have noted growth across the WikiProjects various domains of interest , and see how talk has become significant as a project develops .
Although further analysis is required to understand the context and relationship between article production , discussion , and the role of WikiProjects , our initial findings suggest that WikiProjects are supporting the creation and improvement of Wikipedia articles , and that Talk is an important feature that facilities the communication and interaction within the WikiProject sub communities .
