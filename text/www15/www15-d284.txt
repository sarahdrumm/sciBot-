INTRODUCTION
Recently , recommender systems have been playing an increasingly critical role in coping with information overload . In online systems , there exists massive user rating data that is categorized into different domains such as book , movie or music . Instead of separately mining users’ rating behaviors within a single domain [ 1 ] , recent models ( eg , CMF [ 3 ] ) resort to leveraging more collaborative information shared across multiple domains for better recommendation .
Existing methods [ 3 ] often assume that the users’ underlying tastes remain the same across different domains . However , the above assumption ignores heterogeneity of users’ multiple behaviors , but only concerns their consistency . Let ’s consider a real case of heterogeneity , where educational and occupational demands may count most for choosing books while users’ preference on romantic or science fiction genre can significantly affect their choices of movies . Therefore , users’ collective tastes on multiple domains should also be decided by different decisive factors .
With above concerns , a novel multi domain approach , HMis

Figure 1 : Framework of HMRec . developed to integrate both the consistency and heterogeneity of users’ multiple behaviors in a unified framework . More specifically , as shown in Fig 1 , the user latent factor matrix of each domain is factorized to a combination of two components : the domain shared factor matrix for consistency and the domain specific one for heterogeneity , and behaviordecisive latent factors of each domain are successfully selected in domain specific matrices . Experimental results on the multi domain dataset show the superiority of our model .
2 . OUR APPROACH
2.1 Problem Statement
Suppose that we have user rating matrices for distinct B domains denoted as Rb ∈ Rn×mb ( 1 ≤ b ≤ B ) , where n and mb are respectively the size of overall user set and the size of item set in the bth domain . Then our goal is to predict the missing values in all rating matrices Rb by effectively mining the observed rating records across multiple domains .
2.2 HMRec
Our model is built on the basis of the matrix factorization ( MF ) technique . In the context of multi domain behaviors , HMRec jointly factorizes the rating matrices to learn the domain shared and the domain specific user latent factor matrices as well as the item latent factor matrices of multiple domains .
In our model , let U0 , Ub ∈ Rk×n denote the domainshared user latent factor matrix and the domain specific user latent factor matrix for the bth domain , where k is the number of latent factors . Hence , user latent factor matrix ˜Ub is eventually the function of U0 and Ub , which is defined as ˜Ub = g(U0 , Ub ) . Here we simply adopt the linear function to g(· , · ) as follows
˜Ub = g(U0 , Ub ) = βU0 + ( 1 − β)Ub
( 1 ) where β(0 ≤ β ≤ 1 ) is the tradeoff parameter tending to balance the contribution of the two components . For simplicity , β is kept the same for each domain . Here U0 represents the common user features of all domains , and Ub embodies the domain determined user features . Thereby , collaborative in
95 formation will be transferred among domains by U0 while differences among domains are reflected by Ub .
Since users’ behaviors in different domains are determined by different set of factors , it is necessary to perform the factor selection on the domain specific user latent factor matrix . In order to capture the most decisive factors in each domain , we introduce the ℓ2,1 norm to Ub in our model as follows

Then , with defining Vb ∈ Rk×mb as the item latent factor matrix for domain b , we have rating prediction squared error on training data within domain b as the following form fb(U0 , Ub , Vb ) = n

Particularly , Ib is an indicator matrix whose entry Ib ij is 1 if user ui has rated item vj and 0 otherwise . And ˜Ub ·i , Vb ·j is the ith and j th column of user and item latent factor matrix . With above preliminary formulation , our model is eventually written as minimizing the following objective function
L(U0 , {Ub}B b=1 , {Vb}B b=1 ) =

2.3 Optimization b=1 , {Vb}B
Because Eq ( 4 ) is convex wrt one of the variables U0 , {Ub}B b=1 when the others are fixed , we apply coordinate descent optimization for our model . Then the missing values are predicted as ˆRb ij = ( ˜Ub

3 . EXPERIMENTS
We perform experiments on a multi domain dataset crawled from the website Douban . Douban is a famous Web2.0 website for users to provide their ratings , scaled from 1 to 5 , on books , movies and music . We filtered out users with less than 10 ratings on the 3 domains and obtained a dataset of 5,916 users . The detailed description is presented in Table 1 .

Our method is compared with the following baselines : ( 1)PMF [ 2 ] : the basic MF method , making prediction in each domain separately . ( 2)NCDCF U and NCDCF I [ 1 ] : respectively user based and item based neighborhood methods for multi domain scenarios . ( 3)CMF [ 3 ] : a multi domain MF model which tries to share the same user latent factors across different domains . Note that our model is reduced to PMF if β = 0 , γ = 0 , and CMF when β = 1 , γ = 0 .
In our experiments , we randomly select 80 % observed ratings as training data and the rest are used as testing data . The random selection is preformed 5 times independently , and the parameters are determined . The best average results with standard deviations are then reported . Root Mean Square Error ( RMSE ) is employed as our evaluation metric , which is the most popular metric utilized for rating prediction tasks . Lower values of RMSE correspond to better recommendation performance .
Table 2 summarizes the performance comparisons . In the experiments , we set λ = 0.05 , αb = 1 for our model and the dimension of the latent factors is fixed as k = 10 . Then , the resulting optimal parameters of HMRec are {β = 0.6 , γ = 80} in each domain . We can observe that our approach always outperforms all the other baselines on each domain , including the single domain approach ( PMF ) and the other multi domain ones ( NCDCF U , NCDCF I and CMF ) . The results prove the necessity of introducing domain specific latent factors with factor selection into our proposed model .

Figure 2 : Decisive factor selection of Ub in each domain . Lighter blocks indicate larger values .
Then we randomly sample 100 items from each domain and show their domain specific latent factor space . Fig 2 presents the learnt row sparsity patterns of Ub . And it shows that our method is able to mine the heterogeneity of users’ collective tastes for different domains , and the decisive factors can be successfully selected .
4 . CONCLUSIONS
Our novel recommendation approach manages to model users’ multi domain behaviors with domain shared latent and domain specific factors . And the most decisive factors for different domains are also effectively selected . Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method .
