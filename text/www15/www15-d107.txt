ABSTRACT We propose a new computational approach for tracking and detecting statistically significant linguistic shifts in the meaning and usage of words . Such linguistic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet , where the rapid exchange of ideas can quickly change a word ’s meaning . Our meta analysis approach constructs property time series of word usage , and then uses statistically sound change point detection algorithms to identify significant linguistic shifts .
We consider and analyze three approaches of increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series , the culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word co occurrences . Using recently proposed deep neural language models , we first train vector representations of words for each time period . Second , we warp the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system . Finally , we construct a distance based distributional time series for each word to track it ’s linguistic displacement over time .
We demonstrate that our approach is scalable by tracking linguistic change across years of micro blogging using Twitter , a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from Amazon , and a century of written books using the Google Book ngrams . Our analysis reveals interesting patterns of language usage change commensurate with each medium .

INTRODUCTION
Natural languages are inherently dynamic , evolving over time to accommodate the needs of their speakers . This effect is especially prevalent on the Internet , where the rapid exchange of ideas can change a word ’s meaning overnight .
In this paper , we study the problem of detecting such linguistic shifts on a variety of media including micro blog posts , product reviews , and books . Specifically , we seek to detect the broadening and narrowing of semantic senses of words , as they continually change throughout the lifetime of a medium .
We propose the first computational approach for tracking and detecting statistically significant linguistic shifts of words . To model the temporal evolution of natural language , we construct a time series per word . We investigate three methods to build our word time series . First , we extract Frequency based statistics to capture sudden changes in word usage . Second , we construct Syntactic time series by analyzing each word ’s part of speech ( POS ) tag distribution . Finally , we infer contextual cues from word co occurrence statistics to construct Distributional time series . In order to detect and establish statistical significance of word changes over time , we present a change point detection algorithm , which is compatible with all methods .
Figure 1 illustrates a 2 dimensional projection of the latent semantic space captured by our Distributional method . We clearly observe the sequence of semantic shifts that the word gay has undergone over the last century ( 1900 2005 ) . Ini

Observe for the first 50 years , that it stayed in the same general region of the semantic space . However by 1975 , it had begun a transition over to its current meaning —a shift which accelerated over the years to come .
The choice of the time series construction method determines the type of information we capture regarding word usage . The difference between frequency based approaches and distributional methods is illustrated in Figure 2 . Figure 2a shows the frequencies of two words , Sandy ( red ) , and Hurricane ( blue ) as a percentage of search queries according to Google Trends1 . Observe the sharp spikes in both words’ usage in October 2012 , which corresponds to a storm called Hurricane Sandy striking the Atlantic Coast of the United States . However , only one of those words ( Sandy ) actually acquired a new meaning . Indeed , using our distributional method ( Figure 2b ) , we observe that only the word Sandy shifted in meaning where as Hurricane did not .
Our computational approach is scalable , and we demonstrate this by running our method on three large datasets . Specifically , we investigate linguistic change detection across years of micro blogging using Twitter , a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from Amazon , and a century of written books using the Google Books Ngram Corpus .
Despite the fast pace of change of the web content , our method is able to detect the introduction of new products , movies and books . This could help semantically aware web applications to better understand user intentions and requests . Detecting the semantic shift of a word would trigger such applications to apply focused sense disambiguation analysis .
In summary , our contributions are as follows : • Word Evolution Modeling : We study three different methods for the statistical modeling of word evolution over time . We use measures of frequency , part of speech tag distribution , and word co occurrence to construct time series for each word under investigation.(Section 3 )
• Statistical Soundness : We propose ( to our knowledge ) the first statistically sound method for linguistic shift detection . Our approach uses change point detection in time series to assign significance of change scores to each word . ( Section 4 )
• Cross Domain Analysis : We apply our method on three different domains ; books , tweets and online reviews . Our corpora consists of billions of words and spans several time scales . We show several interesting instances of semantic change identified by our method . ( Section 6 )
The rest of the paper is structured as follows . In Section 2 we define the problem of language shift detection over time . Then , we outline our proposals to construct time series modeling word evolution in Section 3 . Next , in Section 4 , we describe the method we developed for detecting significant changes in natural language . We describe the datasets we used in Section 5 , and then evaluate our system both qualitatively and quantitatively in Section 6 . We follow this with a treatment of related work in Section 7 , and finally conclude

2 . PROBLEM DEFINITION
Our problem is to quantify the linguistic shift in word meaning and usage across time . Given a temporal corpora C that is created over a time span S , we divide the corpora into n snapshots Ct each of period length P . We build a common vocabulary V by intersecting the word dictionaries that appear in all the snapshots ( i.e , we track the same word set across time ) . This eliminates trivial examples of word usage shift from words which appear or vanish throughout the corpus . To model word evolution , we construct a time series T ( w ) for each word w ∈ V . Each point Tt(w ) corresponds to statistical information extracted from corpus snapshot Ct that reflects the usage of w . In Section 3 , we propose several methods to calculate Tt(w ) , each varying in the statistical information used to capture w ’s usage .
Once these time series are constructed , we can quantify the significance of the shift that occurred to the word in its meaning and usage . Sudden increases or decreases in the time series are indicative of shifts in the word usage . Specifically we pose the following questions :
1 . How statically significant is the shift in usage of a word w across time ( in T ( w)) ? .
2 . Given that a word has shifted , at what point in time did the change happen ?
3 . TIME SERIES CONSTRUCTION
Constructing the time series is the first step in quantifying the significance of word change . Different approaches capture different aspects of word ’s semantic , syntactic and usage patterns . In this section , we describe three approaches ( Frequency , Syntactic , and Distributional ) to building a time

The choice of time series significantly influences the types of changes we can detect —a phenomenon which we discuss further in Section 6 . 3.1 Frequency Method
The most immediate way to detect sequences of discrete events is through their change in frequency . Frequency based methods are therefore quite popular , and include tools like Google Trends and Google Books Ngram Corpus , both of which are used in research to predict economical and public health changes [ 8 , 9 ] . Such analysis depends on keyword search over indexed corpora .
Frequency based methods can capture linguistic shift , as changes in frequency can correspond to words acquiring or losing senses . Although crude , this method is simple to implement . We track the change in probability of a word appearing over time . We calculate for each time snapshot corpus Ct , a unigram language model . Specifically , we construct the time series for a word w as follows : #(w ∈ Ct )
( 1 ) where #(w ∈ Ct ) is the number of occurrences of the word w in corpus snapshot Ct . An example of the information we capture by tracking word frequencies over time is shown in Figure 3 . Observe the sudden jump in late 1980s of the word gay in frequency . 3.2 Syntactic Method
Tt(w ) = log
|Ct|
,
While word frequency based metrics are easy to calculate , they are prone to sampling error introduced by bias in domain and genre distribution in the corpus . Temporal events and popularity of specific entities could spike the word usage frequency without significant shift in its meaning , recall Hurricane in Figure 2a .
Another approach to detect and quantify significant change in the word usage involves tracking the syntactic functionality it serves . A word could evolve a new syntactic functionality by acquiring a new part of speech category . For example , apple used to be only a “ Noun ” describing a fruit , but over time it acquired the new part of speech “ Proper Noun ” to indicate the new sense describing a technical company ( Figure 4 ) . To leverage this syntactic knowledge , we annotate our corpus
Figure 4 : Part of speech tag probability distribution of the word apple ( stacked area chart ) . Observe that the “ Proper Noun ” tag has dramatically increased in 1980s . The same trend is clear from the time series constructed using JenssenShannon Divergence ( dark blue line ) . with part of speech ( POS ) tags . Then we calculate the probability distribution of part of speech tags Qt given the word w and time snapshot t as follows : Qt = PrX∼POS Tags(X|w,Ct ) . We consider the POS tag distribution at t = 0 to be the initial distribution Q0 . To quantify the temporal change between two time snapshots corpora , for a specific word w , we calculate the divergence between the POS distributions in both snapshots .
Specifically , we construct the time series as follows :
Tt(w ) = JSD(Q0 , Qt )
( 2 ) where JSD is the Jenssen Shannon divergence [ 23 ] .
Figure 4 shows that the JS divergence ( dark blue line ) reflects the change in the distribution of the part of speech tags given the word apple . In 1980s , the “ Proper Noun ” tag ( blue area ) increased dramatically due to the rise of Apple Computer Inc . , the popular consumer electronics company . 3.3 Distributional Method
Semantic shifts are not restricted to changes to part of speech . For example , consider the word mouse . In the 1970s it acquired a new sense of “ computer input device ” , but did not change its part of speech categorization ( since both senses are nouns ) . To detect such subtle semantic changes , we need to infer deeper cues from the contexts a word is used in .
The distributional hypothesis states that words appearing in similar contexts are semantically similar [ 15 ] . Distributional methods learn a semantic space that maps words to continuous vector space Rd , where d is the dimension of the vector space . Thus , vector representations of words appearing in similar contexts will be close to each other . Recent developments in representation learning ( deep learning ) [ 6 ] have enabled the scalable learning of such models . We use a variation of these models [ 28 ] to learn word vector representation ( word embeddings ) that we track across time . Specifically , we seek to learn a temporal word embedding φt : V,Ct → Rd . Once we learn a representation of a specific word for each time snapshot corpus , we track the changes of the representation across the embedding space to quantify the meaning shift of the word ( as shown in Figure 1 ) .

,
( 6 ) where φk is the model parameters after epoch k . We calculate ρ after each epoch and stop the training if ρ ≤ 10−4 After training stops , we normalize word embeddings by their L2 norm , which forces all words to be represented by unit vectors .
In our experiments , we use gensim implementation of skipgram models2 . We set the context window size m to 10 unless otherwise stated . We choose the size of the word embedding space dimension d to be 200 . To speed up the training , we subsample the frequent words by the ratio 10−5 [ 29 ] . 332 Aligning Embeddings Having trained temporal word embeddings for each time snapshot Ct , we must now align the embeddings so that all the embeddings are in one unified co ordinate system . This enables us to characterize the change between them . This process is complicated by the stochastic nature of our training , which implies that models trained on exactly the same data could produce vector spaces where words have the same nearest neighbors but not with the same coordinates . The alignment problem is exacerbated by actual changes in the distributional nature of words in each snapshot .
To aid the alignment process , we make two simplifying assumptions : First , we assume that the spaces are equivalent under a linear transformation . Second , we assume that the meaning of most words did not shift over time , and therefore , their local structure is preserved . Based on these assumptions , observe that when the alignment model fails to align a word properly , it is possibly indicative of a linguistic shift .
Specifically , we define the set of k nearest words in the embedding space φt to a word w to be k NN(φt(w) ) . We seek to learn a linear transformation Wt→t(w ) ∈ Rd×d that maps a word from φt to φt by solving the following optimization problem :
W t→t
( w ) = argmin
W
φt ( wi)W − φt(wi)2 2 ,
( 7 ) wi∈ k NN(φ t ( w ) ) which is equivalent to a piecewise linear regression model . 333 Time series construction To track the shift of word position across time , we align all embeddings spaces to the embedding space of the initial time snapshot φ0 using a linear mapping ( Eq 7 ) . This unification of coordinate system allows us to compare relative displacements that occurred to words across different time periods .
To capture linguistic shift , we construct our distributional time series by calculating the distance in the embedding space between φt(w)Wt→0(w ) and φ0(w ) as the following :
Tt(w ) = 1 − ( φt(w)Wt→0(w))T φ0(w )
φt(w)Wt→0(w)2φ0(w ) 2

Figure 5 shows the time series obtained using word embeddings for tape , which underwent a semantic change in the 2https://github.com/piskvorky/gensim
Figure 5 : Distributional time series for the word tape over time using word embeddings . Observe the change of behavior starting in the 1950s , which is quite apparent by the 1970s .
In this section we present our distributional approach in detail . Specially we discuss the learning of word embeddings , the aligning of embedding spaces across different time snapshots to a joint embedding space , and the utilization of a word ’s displacement through this semantic space to construct a distributional time series . 331 Learning embeddings Given a time snapshot Ct of the corpus , our goal is to learn φt over V using neural language models . At the beginning of the training process , the words vector representations are randomly initialized . The training objective is to maximize the probability of the words appearing in the context of word wi . Specifically , given the vector representation wi of a word wi ( wi = φt(wi) ) , we seek to maximize the probability of wj through the following equation :
Pr(wj | wi ) = wk∈V exp ( wT j wi ) exp ( wT k wi )
( 3 )
In a single epoch , we iterate over each word occurrence in the time snapshot Ct to minimize the negative log likelihood of the context words . Context words are the words appearing to the left or right of wi within a window of size m ( Equation 4 ) . i+m wi∈Ct j=i−m j!=i
J =
− log Pr(wj | wi )
( 4 )
Notice that the normalization factor that appears in Equation 3 is not feasible to calculate if |V| is too large . To approximate this probability , we map the problem from a classification of 1 out of V words to a hierarchical classification problem [ 32 , 33 ] . This reduces the cost of calculating the normalization factor from O(|V| ) to O(log |V| ) .
We optimize the model parameters using stochastic gradi ent descent [ 7 ] , as follows :
φt(wi ) = φt(wi ) − α × ∂J
∂φt(wi )
,
( 5 ) where α is the learning rate . We calculate the derivatives of the model using the back propagation algorithm . [ 35 ] . We use the following measure of training convergence :

Next , we shuffle the time series points producing the set π(Z(w ) ) ( Step y ) . Then , we apply the mean shift transformation ( K ) on both the original normalized time series Z(w ) and the permuted set ( Step z ) . In Step { , we calculate the probability distribution of the mean shifts possible given a specific time ( t = 1985 ) over the bootstrapped samples . Finally , we compare the observed value in K(Z(w ) ) to the probability distribution of possible values to calculate the p value which determines the statistical significance of the observed time series shift ( Step | ) .

4 . CHANGE POINT DETECTION
Given a time series of a word T ( w ) , constructed using one of the methods discussed in Section 3 , we seek to determine whether the word changed significantly , and if so estimate the change point .
There exists an extensive body of work on change point detection in time series [ 1 , 3 , 40 ] . Our approach models the time series based on the Mean Shift model described in [ 40 ] . First , our method recognizes that language exhibits a general stochastic drift . We account for this by first normalizing the time series for each word . Our method then attempts to detect a shift in the mean of the time series using a variant of mean shift algorithms for change point analysis . We outline our method in Algorithm 1 and describe it below . We also illustrate key aspects of the method in Figure 6 . Given a time series of a word T ( w ) , we first normalize the w∈V Ti(w ) and time series . We calculate the mean µi = 1|V| w∈V ( Ti(w ) − µi)2 across all standard deviation V ari = 1|V| words . Then , we transform the time series into a Z − Score series as follows :
Zi(w ) =
Ti(w ) − µi
V ari
( 9 ) where Zi(w ) is the z score of the time series for the word w at time snapshot i . We model the time series Z(w ) by a Mean shift model [ 40 ] . Let S = Z1(w),Z2(w ) , . . . ,Zn(w ) represent the time series . We model S to be an output of a stochastic process where each Si can be described as Si = µi + i where µi is the mean and i is the random error at time i . We also assume that the errors i are independent with mean 0 . Generally µi = µi−1 except for a few points which are change points .
Based on the above model , we define the mean shift of a general time series S as follows : l k=j+1 j k=1
K(S ) =
1 l − j
Sk − 1 j
Sk
( 10 )
This corresponds to calculating the shift in mean between two parts of the time series pivoted at time point j . Change points can be thus identified by detecting significant shifts in the mean . 3 Given a normalized time series Z(w ) , we then compute the mean shift series K(Z(w ) ) ( Line 2 ) . To estimate the 3This is similar to the CUSUM based approach used for detecting change points which is also based on mean shift model .

In particular , we establish statistical significance by first obtaining B(typically B = 1000 ) bootstrap samples obtained by permuting Z(w ) ( Lines 3 10 ) . Second , for each bootstrap sample P , we calculate K(P ) to yield its corresponding bootstrap statistic and we estimate the statistical significance ( p value ) of observing the mean shift at time i compared to the N U LL distribution(Lines 8 10 ) . Finally , we estimate the change point by considering the time point j with the minimum p value score ( described in [ 39] ) . While this method does detect significant changes in the mean of the time series , observe that it does not account for the magnitude of the change in terms of Z Scores . We extend this approach to obtain words that changed significantly compared to other words , by considering only those time points where the Z Score exceeds a user defined threshold γ ( we typically set γ to 175 ) We then estimate the change point as the time point with the minimum p value exactly as outlined before ( Lines 11 14 ) .
5 . DATASETS
Here we report the details of the three datasets that we consider years of micro blogging from Twitter , a decade of movie reviews from Amazon , and a century of written books using the Google Books Ngram Corpus . Table 1 shows a summary of three different datasets spanning different modes of expression on the Internet : books , online forum and a micro blogs .
The Google Books Ngram Corpus .
The Google Books Ngram Corpus project enables the analysis of cultural , social and linguistic trends . It contains the frequency of short phrases of text ( ngrams ) that were extracted from books written in eight languages over five centuries [ 27 ] . These ngrams vary in size ( 1 5 ) grams . We use the 5 gram phrases which restrict our context window size m to 5 . Here , we show a sample of 5 grams we used :
• thousand pounds less then nothing • to communicate to each other
We focus on the time span from 1900 − 2005 , and set the time snapshot period to 5 years(21 points ) . We obtain the POS Distribution of each word in the above time range by using the Google Syntactic Ngrams dataset [ 16 , 24 , 25 ] .
Amazon Movie Reviews .
Amazon Movie Reviews dataset consists of movie reviews from Amazon . This data spans August 1997 to October 2012(13 time points ) , including all 8 million reviews . However , we consider the time period starting from 2000 as the number of reviews from earlier years is considerably small . Each review includes product and user information , ratings , and a plain text review . A sample review text is shown below :

6 . EXPERIMENTS
In this section , we apply our method for each dataset presented in Section 5 and identify words that have changed usage over time . We describe the results of our experiments below . 6.1 Time Series Analysis
As we shall see in Section 6.4 , our proposed time series construction methods differ in performance . Here , we use the detected words to study the behavior of our construction methods .
Table 2 shows the time series constructed for a sample of words with their corresponding p value time series , displayed in the last column . A dip in the p value is indicative of a shift in the word usage . The first three words , transmitted , bitch , and sex , are detected by both the Frequency and Distributional methods . Table 3 shows the previous and current senses of these words demonstrating the changes in usage they have gone through .
Observe that words like her and desk did not change , however , the Frequency method detects a change . The sharp increase of the word her in frequency around the 1960 ’s could be attributed to the concurrent rise and popularity of the feminist movement . Sudden temporary popularity of specific social and political events could lead the Frequency method to produce many false positives . These results confirm our intuition we illustrated in Figure 2 . While frequency analysis ( like Google Trends ) is an extremely useful tool to visualize trends , it is not very well suited for the task of detecting linguistic shift .
The last two rows in Table 2 display two words ( apple and diet ) that Syntactic method detected . The word apple was detected uniquely by the Syntactic method as its most frequent part of speech tag changed significantly from “ Noun ” to “ Proper Noun ” . While both Syntactic and Distributional methods indicate the change in meaning of the word diet , it is only the Distributional method that detects the right point of change ( as shown in Table 3 ) . The Syntactic method is indicative of having low false positive rate , but suffers from a high false negative rate , given that only two words in the table were detected . Furthermore , observe that Syntactic method relies on good linguistic taggers . However , linguistic

Distributional taggers require annotated data sets and also do not work well across domains .
We find that the Distributional method offers a good balance between false positives and false negatives , while requiring no linguistic resources of any sort . Having analyzed the words detected by different time series we turn our attention to the analysis of estimated changepoints . 6.2 Historical Analysis
We have demonstrated that our methods are able to detect words that shifted in meaning . We seek to identify the inflection points in time where the new senses are introduced . Moreover , we are interested in understanding how the new acquired senses differ from the previous ones .
Table 3 shows sample words that are detected by Syntactic and Distributional methods . The first set represents words which the Distributional method detected ( Distributional better ) while the second set shows sample words which Syntactic method detected ( Syntactic better ) .
Our Distributional method estimates that the word tape changed in the early 1970s to mean a “ cassette tape ” and not only an “ adhesive tape ” . The change in the meaning of tape commences with the introduction of magnetic tapes in 1950s ( Figure 5 ) .

Table 4 : Sample of words detected by our Distributional method on Amazon Reviews and Tweets . duction of new products inflected a shift the word meaning . The introduction of Polystyrene in 1950 popularized the term “ plastic ” as a synthetic polymer , which was once used only denote the physical property of “ flexibility ” . The popularity of books on dieting started with the best selling book Dr . Atkins’ Diet Revolution by Robert C . Atkins in 1972 [ 20 ] . This changed the use of the word diet to mean a life style of food consumption behavior and not only the food consumed by an individual or group .
The Syntactic section of Table 3 shows that words like hug and sink were previously used mainly as verbs . Over time organizations and movements started using hug as a noun which dominated over its previous sense . On the other hand , the words click and handle , originally nouns , started being used as verbs .
Another clear trend is the use of common words as proper nouns . For example , with the rise of the computer industry , the word apple acquired the sense of the tech company Apple in mid 1980s and the word windows shifted its meaning to the operating system developed by Microsoft in early 1990s . Additionally , we detect the word bush became widely used as proper noun in 1989 , which coincides with George H . W . Bush ’s presidency in USA . 6.3 Cross Domain Analysis
( a ) Frequency Perturbation
( b ) Syntactic Perturbation
Figure 7 : Performance of our proposed methods under different scenarios of perturbation .
Semantic shift can occur much faster on the web , where words can acquire new meanings within weeks , or even days . In this section we turn our attention to analyzing linguistic shift on Amazon Reviews and Twitter ( content that spans a much shorter time scale as compared to Google Books Ngram Corpus ) .
Table 4 shows our Distributional method results on Amazon Reviews and Twitter datasets . New technologies and products introduced new meanings to words like streaming , ray , rays , combo . The word twilight acquired new sense in 2009 concurrent with the release of the Twilight movie in November 2008 .
Similar trends can be observed in Twitter . The introduction of new games and cellphone applications changed the meaning of the words candy , mystery and rally . The word sandy acquired a new sense in September 2012 weeks before Hurricane Sandy hitting the East Coast of USA . Similarly we see that the word shades shifted its meaning with the release of the bestselling book “ Fifty Shades of Grey ” in June 2012 .
These examples illustrate the capability of our method to detect the introduction of new products , movies and books . This could help semantically aware web applications to understand user intentions and requests better . Detecting the semantic shift of a word would trigger such applications to apply a focused disambiguation analysis on the sense intended by the user . 6.4 Quantitative Evaluation
To evaluate the quantitative merits of our approach , we use a synthetic setup which enables us to model linguistic shift in a controlled fashion by artificially introducing changes to a corpus .
Our synthetic corpus is created as follows : First , we duplicate a copy of a Wikipedia corpus4 20 times to model time snapshots . We tagged the Wikipedia corpora with part of speech tags using the TextBlob tagger5 . Next , we introduce changes to a word ’s usage to model linguistics shift . To do this , we perturb the last 10 snapshots . Finally , we use our approach to rank all words according to their p values , and then we calculate the Mean Reciprocal Rank i=1 1/rank(wi ) ) for the words we perturbed . We rank the words that have lower p value higher , therefore , we expect the MRR to be higher in the methods that are able to discover more words that have changed .
( M RR = 1/|Q||Q|
To introduce a single perturbation , we sample a pair of
4http://mattmahoneynet/dc/text8zip 5http://textblobreadthedocsorg/en/dev/ words out of the vocabulary excluding functional words and stop words6 . We designate one of them to be a donor and the other to be a receptor . The donor word occurrences will be replaced with the receptor word with a success probability preplacement . For example , given the word pair ( location , equation ) , some of the occurrences of the word location ( Donor ) were replaced with the word equation ( Receptor ) in the second five snapshots of Wikipedia .
Figure 7 illustrates the results on two types of perturbations we synthesized . First , we picked our ( Donor , Receptor ) pairs such that both of them have the same most frequent part of speech tag . For example , we might use the pair ( boat , car ) but not ( boat , running ) . We expect the frequency of the receptor to change and its context distribution but no significant syntactic changes . Figure 7a shows the MRR of the receptor words on Distributional and Frequency methods . We observe that both methods improve their rankings as the degree of induced change increases ( measured , here , by preplacement ) . Second , we observe that the Distributional approach outperforms Frequency method consistently for different values of preplacement .
Second , to compare Distributional and Syntactic methods we sample word pairs without the constraint of being from the same part of speech categories . Figure 7b shows that the Syntactic method while outperforming Distributional method when the perturbation statistically is minimal , its ranking continue to decline in quality as the perturbation increases . This could be explained by the fact that the quality of the tagger annotations decreases as the corpus at inference time diverges from the training corpus .
It is quite clear from both experiments , that the Distributional method outperforms other methods when preplacement > 0.4 without requiring any language specific resources or annotators .
7 . RELATED WORK
Because our work lies at the intersection of different fields , we will discuss the most relevant four areas of work : linguistic shift , word embeddings , change point detection , and Internet linguistics . 7.1 Linguistic Shift
There has been a surge in the work about language evolution over time [ 11 , 17 , 18 , 21 , 27 , 41 ] . Michel et al . [ 27 ] detected important political events by analyzing frequent patterns . Juola [ 21 ] compared language from different time periods and quantified the change . Different from both studies , we quantify linguistic change by tracking individual shifts in words meaning . This fine grain detection and tracking still allows us to quantify the change in natural language as a whole , while still being able to interpret these changes .
Previous work on topic modeling and distributional semantics [ 11 , 17 , 18 , 38 , 41 ] either restrict their period to two language snapshots , or do not suggest a change point detection algorithm . Some of the above work is also restricted to detecting changes in entities ( eg Iraq ) . Mitra et al . [ 31 ] use a graph based approach relying on dependency parsing of sentences . Our proposed time series construction methods require minimal linguistic knowledge and resources enabling the application of our approach to all languages and domains equally . Compared to the sequential training

[ 22 ] work , our technique warps the embeddings spaces of the different time snapshots after the training , allowing for efficient training that could be parallelized for large corpora .
Moreover , our work is unique in the fact that our datasets span different time scales , cover larger user interactions and represent a better sample of the web . 7.2 Word Embeddings
Hinton [ 19 ] proposed distributed representations ( word embeddings ) , to learn a mapping of symbolic data to continuous space . Bengio et al . [ 5 ] used these word embeddings to develop a neural language model that outperforms traditional ngram models . Several efforts have been proposed to scale and speed up the computation of such big networks [ 4 , 13 , 32 , 33 ] . Word embeddings are shown to capture fine grain structures and regularities in the data [ 29 , 30 ] . Moreover , they proved to be useful for a wide range of natural language processing tasks [ 2 , 10 ] . The same technique of learning word embeddings has been applied recently to learning graph representation [ 34 ] . 7.3 Change point detection
Change Point Detection and Analysis is an important problem in the area of Time Series Analysis and Modeling . Taylor [ 40 ] describes control charts and CUSUM based methods in detail . Adams and MacKay [ 1 ] describes a Bayesian approach to Online Change Point Detection.The method of bootstrapping and establishing statistical significance is outlined in [ 14 ] . Basseville and Nikiforov [ 3 ] provides an excellent survey on several elementary change point detection techniques and time series models . 7.4 Relation to Internet Linguistics
Internet Linguistics is concerned with the study of language in media influenced by the Internet ( online forums , blogs , online social media ) and also other related forms of electronic media like Text Messaging . Schiano et al . [ 36 ] and Tagliamonte and Denis [ 37 ] study how teenagers use messaging media focusing on their usage patterns and the resulting implications on design of e mail and Instant messaging ( IM ) . Merchant [ 26 ] study the language use by teenagers in online chat forums . An excellent survey on Internet Linguistics is provided by [ 12 ] and includes linguistic analyses of social media like Twitter , Facebook or Google+ .
8 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We proposed three approaches to model word evolution across time through different time series construction methods . We designed a computational approach to detect statistically significant linguistic shifts . Finally , we demonstrated our method on three different data sets each representing a different medium . By analyzing the Google Books Ngram Corpus , we were able to detect historical semantic shifts that happened to words like gay and bitch . Moreover , in faster evolving medium like Tweets and Amazon Reviews , we were able to detect recent events like storms and game and book releases . This capability of detecting meaning shift , should help decipher the ambiguity of dynamical systems like natural languages . We believe our work has implications to the fields of Semantic Search and the recently burgeoning field of Internet Linguistics .
For our future work , we will focus on building real time analysis of data that link other attributes of data like geographical locations and content source to understand better the mechanism of meaning change and influential players in such change .
