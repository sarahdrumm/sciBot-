ABSTRACT The ability to model and predict the popularity dynamics of individual user generated items on online media has important implications in a wide range of areas . In this paper , we propose a probabilistic model using a Self Excited Hawkes Process ( SEHP ) to characterize the process through which individual microblogs gain their popularity . This model explicitly captures the triggering effect of each forwarding , distinguishing itself from the reinforced Poisson process based model where all previous forwardings are simply aggregated as a single triggering effect . We validate the proposed model by applying it on Sina Weibo , the most popular microblogging network in China . Experimental results demonstrate that the SEHP model consistently outperforms the model based on reinforced Poisson process .

INTRODUCTION
With the explosive growth of User Generated Contents ( UGC ) on online media , it becomes an important issue to predict the popularity dynamics of UGC items , including microblogs , tweets , videos , to name a few . Popularity prediction has important implications in many domains , including viral marketing , public opinion monitoring , etc . Early studies devote to characterizing the distribution of the popularity over an aggregation of UGC items [ 2 ] and making prediction by exploiting temporal correlations [ 1 , 5 ] .
Recently , researchers began to model the popularity dynamics of individual UGC items [ 3 , 4 ] . However , these models usually assume an aggregate stochastic process without distinguishing the triggering effects of different forwarding actions in the diffusion and reaction process . Therefore , although these models gain success in predicting , say , the citation counts of scientific papers and view counts of Youtube videos , they are not applicable to model popularity dynamics over a microblogging network , where interactions among users matter much in popularity dynamics .
In this paper , we propose a probabilistic model using a Self Excited Hawkes Process ( SEHP ) to model the process through which individual microblogs gain their popularity . This model explicitly captures the triggering effect of each forwarding , distinguishing itself from the reinforced Poisson process ( RPP ) based model presented in [ 4 ] , where all previous forwardings are simply aggregated as a single triggering effect ( see Fig 1 ) . We validate the proposed model by applying it on Sina Weibo1 , the most popular microblogging network in China . Experimental results demonstrate that this model consistently outperforms the model based on reinforced Poisson process .
2 . THE SEHP MODEL
When a microblog spreads , it creates a cascade on the microblogging network . The popularity dynamics of each microblog during observed time period [ 0 , T ] can be characterized by a set of time stamps ti ( 1 ≤ i ≤ N ) which denote the occurrence time of each forwardings . Here , N is the total number of forwardings . Without loss of generality , we have 0 = t0 ≤ t1 ≤ t2 ≤ ≤ ti ≤ ≤ tN ≤ T . For a microblog , we model its popularity dynamics using an SEHP characterized with the following rate function jmax ( t )
λ(t ) = ve−βt + α
Xj=1 e−β(t−tj ) ,
( 1 ) where v is the initial triggering strength that reflects the attractiveness of the microblog , α is the triggering strength of each subsequent forwarding , and jmax(t ) is the index of the last forwarding before time t . We set an exponential decaying function with exponent β for simplicity .
According to the survival theory , given that the ( i − 1)th forwarding arrives at ti−1 , the probability that the i th forwarding arrives at ti follows p(ti|ti−1 ) = e

Assuming that forwardings during different time intervals are statistically independent , the likelihood of observing a cascade of a microblog and its subsequent forwardings during time interval [ 0 , T ] follows
L(α , β , v ) = p(T |tN )

We employ maximum likelihood estimation to infer the parameters in the proposed model . With the estimated parameters , the model can be used to predict the expected number c(t ) of forwardings of a microblog up to any given time t . With the rate function in Eq ( 1 ) , we obtain the prediction function c(t ) = N+ v

3 . EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
Experiments are conducted on a dataset from Sina Weibo , published by the WISE 2012 Challenge2 . We select microblogs that were submitted during July 1 31 , 2011 and have more than 10 forwardings during the first hour and more than 100 forwardings during forty eight hours after submission . This resulting dataset consists of 5670 microblogs and their cascades .
To validate the prediction performance of the SEHP , we compare it with the state of the art model based on reinforced Poisson process [ 4 ] , in terms of two metrics :
• Mean Absolute Percentage Error ( M AP E ) : It measures the average derivation between the predicted and observed popularity over all microblogs . Denoting the predicted popularity for a microblog i up to time t as

• Accuracy : It measures the fraction of microblogs , correctly predicted under a given error tolerance ǫ . Specifically , the accuracy of popularity prediction over M microblogs is

The threshold ǫ is set as 0.2 in this paper .
We set the training period , ie , T , as 6 hours and then predict the popularity for each microblog from the 1st to 42nd hour after the training period . As shown in Fig 2 , the SEHP model consistently exhibits lower error and higher accuracy than the RPP model .
In this paper , we proposed a probabilistic model to characterize and predict the popularity dynamics of microblogs using an SEHP . Experiments on a Sina Weibo dataset demonstrated that this model consistently outperforms the baseline model based on reinforced Poisson process .
