ABSTRACT Online pet social networks provide a unique opportunity to study an online social network in which a single user manages multiple user profiles , ie one for each pet they own . These types of multi profile networks allow us to investigate two questions : ( 1 ) What is the relationship between the petlevel and human level network , and ( 2 ) what is the relationship between friendship links and family ties ? Concretely , we study the online pet social networks Catster , Dogster and Hamsterster , and show how the networks on the two levels interact , and perform experiments to find out whether knowledge about friendships on a profile level alone can be used to predict which users are behind which profile .

INTRODUCTION
The specific topic that unifies an online community usually does not affect its basic mechanism : A user creates an account to connect with other users . Online pet social networks are however different in this regard , as they allow users to create any number of accounts , one for each pet they own .
In online pet social networks , a single user may ( and is expected to ) create one account for each owned pet . All social networking functionality such as entering personal information , creating friendship links to others , etc . , are then performed on the pet level . With their structure that allows multiple profiles per account , online pet social networks thus make it possible to investigate the following questions : • How does the fact that individual users own multiple profiles influence the structure of the social network ? • Is it possible to predict that two accounts are managed by the same person ?
An overview of our datasets of Dogster.com , Catster.com and Hamsterster.com ( defunct as of 2014 ) is given in Table 1 . On all three sites , a single user can create accounts for any number of pets . Catster and Dogster are connected , and thus a single user account can be used for both sites . The group of pet profiles created by a single user makes up a

Friendship links are allowed within a single household in Dogster and Catster , but are not allowed in Hamsterster . All friendship links are undirected .
2 . HOMOPHILY IN PET NETWORKS
The term homophily refers to the tendency of people connected through social ties to be similar to each other . More precisely , homophily can be measured by a network ’s assortativity with respect to a given node property . A network then displays positive homophily ( assortativity ) when two randomly chosen connected persons are more similar than two randomly chosen persons without regard to connections [ 2 ] . Inversely , a network displays negative homophily ( dissortativity ) when the opposite is the case . By analysing the homophily in online pet social networks , we want to answer the following questions : • Which is higher , the homophily between friends , or • Which profile properties correlate with two pets being friends , and with two pets being in the same household ? within families ?
In order to answer these questions , we propose two complementary assortativity coefficients that apply to multiprofile social networks , whose ratio is measure of the relative strength of intra household homophily as compared to across friendship homophily .
Methodology . Many different node properties can be subject to homophily analysis , and the exact method used for measuring it depends on the data type considered . We define two measures of assortativity for multi profile networks : one that measures homophily on the profile friendship level ( rp ) and one that measures homophily on the account level ( ra ) . For the friendship level , we consider the friendship edges between pets in the networks . For the account level , we consider all pairs of pets that are in the same household . As in most social networks , we expect to observe a certain amount of homophily in the pet friendship network . We further hypothesize that the homophily between pets within a single household is larger than the homophily for pets connected by friendship links . Therefore , we compute measures of homophily for both levels , based on the available pet characteristics .
For categorical variables , we base the assortativity coefficients on [ 2 , Eq ( 2) ] . The assortativity coefficients defined in this way equal one for perfect positive homophily , and lie between negative one and zero for negative homophily.1 For 1The value cannot be exactly −1 ; see [ 2 ] for an explanation .

1.95 1.73 1.87 1.87 numerical variables , we use the Pearson correlation coefficient between the numerical properties of connected pets , as defined in [ 2 , Eq ( 20) ] . The values of this statistic range from −1 to +1 and are one for perfect positive homophily and −1 for perfect negative homophily . For the geolocation , we use the distance correlation [ 3 ] as a measure of homophily , based on the great circle distance between pairs of locations . All three types of assortativity measures are zero when neither positive nor negative homophily is observed . To compare the both the assortativity coefficients on the friendship level and on the account level , we define the multiprofile assortativity ratio of a profile characteristic as rrel = |ra/rp| . By construction rrel is larger than one if the assortativity is higher within profiles of one account than across friendships , and smaller than one if it is the assortativity across friendships that is higher .
3 . PREDICTING FAMILY TIES
A family tie can be thought to exist between two pets that are in the same family , ie , whose profiles were created by the same user account . We analyse in this section the task of predicting that two pets are in the same family , given only friendship links and pet level profile metadata . This allows us to determine how well it can be predicted whether two profiles are from the same account , even when that information is not public . Since we have multiple types of profile data available , we can investigate which profile data allows to do this how well . Also , the experiment serves to find out which properties of pets are consistent within a household , and which are independent of a household .
Prediction Methods . Given a multi profile social network G = ( V , W , E , m ) , we want to predict whether two profiles are managed by the same account , ie , information contained in W and m , using only the profile level network Gp = ( V , E ) , including the metadata associated with it . In the case of pet social networks , we use the available pet profile information along with the pet level friendship links for learning . We investigate the following indicators ( ie , features ) , each of which applies to a pair of profiles {u , v} . We do not use geographical distance between the two profiles , because we know that if the distance is larger than zero , then the profiles must be in distinct households . Thus , we only use the “ same location ” feature . Note also that the geolocation is given only up to the city level , ie all pets in New York City will be counted as having the same location , leading to a large number of pets from different households but with the exact same location . We also perform a logistic regression prediction , combining all features given above .
Experiments .
In order to measure the accuracy of each prediction method , we use a test set defined in the same manner as the training set , ie , we randomly sample e pet pairs known to be in the same family , and e pet pairs known not to be in the same family . This test set is disjoint from

Regression a Hamsterster does not allow friendship links within one household . b Dogster does not allow to specify a dog ’s coloration . c Catster allows exact weights and Dogster has weight ranges . the training set used for learning the regression parameters . The accuracy of the prediction methods is measured using the area under the curve ( AUC ) [ 1 ] . The AUC is 1/2 for a random prediction , and one for a perfectly accurate prediction . Table 2 gives the AUC values for each method separately and for the regression predictions , as well as the learned regression weights for each of the three sites .
Discussion . We observe that in all three sites , pets in the same household can be detected with an AUC of over 99 % using the regression predictor . This means that given two pairs of pets , one of which from the same household and one of which from two different households , our algorithm will detect which is which in over 99 % of cases . This high value can be explained by the fact that certain individual indicators are already highly indicative of family ties .
