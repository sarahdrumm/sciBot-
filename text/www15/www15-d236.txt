ABSTRACT Since users often consider more than one aspect when they choose an item , relevant researches introduced multi criteria recommender systems and showed that multi criteria ratings add values to the existing collaborative filtering based recommender systems to provide more accurate recommendation results to users . However , all the previous works require multi criteria ratings given by users explicitly while most of the existing datasets such as Netflix and MovieLens include only single criterion ratings . Therefore , to take advantage of multi criteria recommendation , there must be a way to extract necessary aspects and analyze users’ preferences on those aspects from the given single criterion type of dataset . In this paper , we propose an approach of utilizing semantic information of items to extracting essential aspects for performing multi aspect collaborative filtering to recommend users with items in a personalized manner .

1 . INTRODUCTION Collaborative Filtering ( CF ) based recommender systems utilize the feedback information that users provide for the items that they consumed or purchased to predict their preferences on items , and to recommend the users with new items based on the predicted preferences . The most popular examples of using CF based recommendation include Netflix , which recommends movie contents , and Amazon.com , which recommends books , CDs , and various products to their users .
Most of the existing CF based recommender systems use a single criterion , such as users’ general ratings on items , to represent and analyze users’ preferences on items in a two dimensional useritem matrix . However , users often consider more than one aspect when they choose an item [ 1 , 2 ] . Recently , many industries have begun employing multi criteria ratings . For example , Zagat ’s Guide provides three criteria for restaurant ratings such as food , décor , and service . Online shopping malls such as Circuitcity.com and Buy.com also use multiple criteria such as display , performance , battery life , and cost for rating consumer electronics . Research

ACM 978 1 4503 3473 0/15/05 . http://dxdoiorg/101145/27409082742780 results [ 2 4 ] show that multi criteria ratings add values to the existing CF based recommender systems since they provide more accurate recommendation results to users . They all require multicriteria ratings given by users explicitly . However , it is usually a burden for a user to provide more than one explicit feedback about an item . Even user feedback datasets are usually sparse even for the case of using a single criterion . We argue that this is the main obstacle of using multi criteria ratings for the existing CF based recommender systems . to perform multi aspect collaborative filtering
To overcome this obstacle and take the advantage of multicriteria recommendation , we propose an approach of utilizing semantic information of items to extracting essential aspects that can be used to recommend users with items in a personalized manner . The intuition is that we will be able to measure users’ preferences on multiple aspects , which a user mostly considers in choosing items , by analyzing the common characteristics of the items that the user and other users of similar preferences consumed .
2 . MULTI ASPECT COLLABORATIVE FILTERING BASED RECOMMENDATION As shown in Figure 1 , the proposed approach provides four phases . Firstly , out of a given user item matrix , we generate a set of concept groups by using keywords such as the words in the title of each item . We use Linked Data to extract semantic information about the keywords . A concept group is a group of semantically relevant terms , and the relationships among them that represent the essential semantics of a keyword . After generating concept groups , we analyze the common characteristics of them for each user by measuring their similarity in each aspect . We assume that domain aspects , such as story , acting and directing , which should be considered , are given . According to the given aspects , we identify users’ preferences on items by counting the overlapped concepts in their concept groups for each of the aspects . Then , we find

49 correlated users by measuring aspect similarity between users . Based on the correlated user groups , we divide the given user item matrix into a set of sub matrices that represent more focused groups of users and items in each aspect .
To predict users’ ratings on new items , we perform matrix completion using regularized singular value decomposition ( SVD ) for each sub matrix generated in the previous phase . We then integrate the results from the sub matrices for each aspect . Lastly , we integrate the results generated for each aspect by assigning different weight values for different aspects to recommend users with new items .
3 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS In order to prove the effectiveness of the proposed approach , we conducted an experiment . We compared the prediction accuracy of the proposed approach against other CF based recommendation methods to prove whether the proposed approach improves the prediction accuracy . Various CF based methods such as user based ( UserBsd ) and item based ( ItemBsd ) methods which are the memory based CF methods as well as regularized SVD ( RegSVD ) , non negative matrix factorization ( NMF ) , probabilistic matrix factorization ( PMF ) , Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization ( BPMF ) , and local low rank matrix approximation ( LLORMA ) which are model based CF methods were selected as baselines .
For the experiment , we used the MovieLens dataset 1 . The MovieLens dataset that we used contains 1,000,209 ratings given by 6,040 users about 3,883 items ( its rating density is 426 % ) In addition , we used Linked Movie Database and DBpedia in Linked Data to enrich the item information with appropriate semantics . The DBpedia dataset was selected as the primary knowledge base because it is highly interlinked with Linked Movie Database . We assumed that three aspects , genre , actor , and director , are given in this movie domain and obtained relevant data from the datasets . We split the MovieLens dataset into a training set and a testing set with the ratio of 8:2 respectively . To avoid bias in the experiment , we performed 5 fold cross validation .
We use mean absolute error ( MAE ) and root mean squared error ( RMSE ) as the evaluation criteria because they are the most popular methods to measure prediction accuracy . We also measured and compared the average precision and normalized discounted cumulative gain ( NDCG ) in the experiment . They are widely used to evaluate how accurate the ranking or ordering of recommendation results is . NDCG reflects the importance of considering the topranked items .

Table 1 shows recommendation performance of the baseline recommendation the proposed multi aspect approaches and

Overall , the proposed approach , ‘MultiAspect’ , shows better accuracy in predicting users’ ratings on new items than other approaches . More specifically , the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approaches by around 0.1481 ( 22.57 % ) to 0.3649 ( 41.80 % ) in terms of MAE , and around 0.1227 ( 14.59 % ) to 0.3312 ( 31.56 % ) in terms of RMSE . The proposed approach also shows significant improvements in average precision and NDCG . More specifically , the proposed approach outperforms the baseline approaches in terms of average precision and NDCG around 0.0456 ( 5.37 % ) to 0.1007 ( 12.69 % ) and around 00405(440 % ) to 00715(805 % ) respectively . This implies that our approach is much more accurate at generating rankings of top n predicted ratings ( in this experiment , n=10 ) than the baselines .
4 . CONCLUSION In this paper , to enable the multi aspect collaborative filtering with the datasets that include only ratings on a single criterion , we proposed an approach of enriching item information with concept groups that are generated by associating the items with relevant concepts retrieved from Linked Data .
The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows . First , we proposed a framework of utilizing Linked Data to expand keywords extracted from item metadata to understand users’ preferences on multiple aspects . Secondly , we proposed a way of identifying similar interests of users by comparing concept groups generated from a user item matrix with given aspects . Lastly , we developed an effective way of aggregating the prediction results from sub matrices in multiple aspects as a weighted sum , so that we personalize the recommendation results .
In our future research , we will make our approach more scalable . The proposed approach performs matrix completion , which time complexity increases exponentially as the number of users and items increases . We are currently investigating using cluster machines to run our approach in a concurrent manner .
