The topological properties of the underlying complex networks play an important role in understanding and solving the application problems .
In mathematics , spectral graph theory , as an enabling tool , establishes relationship between various properties of a graph and the characteristic polynomial , eigenvalues , and eigenvectors of matrices associated to the graph , such as its adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix . For examples , the number of zero eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian matrix indicates the number of disconnected components of the network . The pseudo inverse of the graph Laplacian matrix infers the hitting time and commute time of a random walk on the underlying network . These spectral properties of the graphs can be utilized to tackle application problems in various seemingly unrelated network settings . In this paper , we summarize works in the literature , that develops and applies spectral graph theory to study the crucial and unique properties of various types of graphs , such as directed graphs ( digraphs ) , undirected graphs , and signed graphs , with applications to wireless networking [ 11 , 12 , 15 ] , the Internet traffic engineering [ 17 , 18 ] , and online social network ( OSN ) analysis [ 9 , 16 , 10 ] .
To our best knowledge , this is the first work that provides comprehensive study on applications of spectral graph theory on various application problems . The paper is organized as follows . Section 2 provides an overview of the spectral graph theory . Section 3 discusses various applications of spectral graph theory under three graph models , including directed graphs , undirected graphs , and signed graphs . To be specific , Section 3.1 introduces a generalized digraph spectral graph theory [ 13 , 14 ] with applications in estimating wireless transmission costs [ 12 ] . Section 3.2 studies the setting of undirected graph , with application of Internet traffic engineering . Section 3.3 discusses the generalization of spectral graph theory to signed graphs with both positive and negative links , and the application scenario is social influence maximization in online viral marketing . Section 4 discusses the future research directions , and Section 5 concludes the paper .
2 . PRELIMINARIES
Emerging in the 1950s , spectral graph theory studies the properties of a graph in relationship to the characteristic polynomial , eigenvalues , and eigenvectors of matrices associated to the graph , such as its adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix . Earlier studies primarily focus on undirected graphs [ 6 , 20 , 7 , 5 , 3 , 4 ] , with symmetric adjacency matrices , real eigenvalues , and a complete set of orthonormal eigenvectors . The entire set of eigenvalues and eigenvectors form the graph ’s spectrum . We use a triple G = ( V , E , A ) to denote an undirected and weighted graph on the node set V = {1 , 2 , . . . , n} . The n × n ( nonnegative ) weight matrix A = [ aij ] is symmetric , and is defined
1069 otherwise . For 1 ≤ i ≤ n , the degree of node i is di =n node degrees , d =n in such a way that aij = aji > 0 , if i , j ∈ E , and aij = aji = 0 j=1 aij . The volume of G , denoted by vol(G ) , is defined as the sum of all i=1 di , ie , vol(G ) = d .
A random walk on G is a Markov chain defined on G with the transition probability matrix P = [ pij ] , where pij = aij/di . Let D = diag[di ] be a diagonal matrix of node degrees , then P = D−1A . Without loss of generality , we assume that the undirected graph G is connected ( ie , any node can reach any other node in G ) . Then it can be shown ( see , eg , [ 1 ] ) that the Markov chain is irreducible , and there exists a unique stationary distribution , {π1 , π2 , . . . , πn} . Let π = [ πi]1≤i≤n be the column vector of the stationary probabilities . Then πT P = πT , where the superscript T represents ( vector or matrix ) transpose . Furthermore , this Markov chain ( random walk ) on G is reversible , namely and

[ 6 ] uses the normalized graph Laplacian ( instead of the unnormalized version L = D − A ) . Given an undirected G , the normalized graph Laplacian of G ( also called normalized Laplacian matrix of G ) is defined as follows : − 1
( 3 ) A key property of the graph Laplacian ( for an undirected graph ) is that L is symmetric and positive semi definite [ 8 ] . Hence all eigenvalues of L are nonnegative real numbers . In particular , for a connected undirected graph G , L has rank n−1 and has exactly one zero eigenvalue ( its smallest one ) . Let λ1 = 0 < λ2 ≤ ··· ≤ λn be the n eigenvalues of L arranged in an increasing order , and µi , 1 ≤ i ≤ n , be the corresponding eigenvectors ( of unit norm ) . In particular , one can show that the ( column ) eigenvector , µ1 , of L associated with the eigenvalue λ1 = 0 , is given by

Define Γ := diag[λ1 , . . . , λn ] , the diagonal matrix formed by the eigenvalues , and U = [ µ1 , . . . , µn ] , an orthonormal matrix formed by the eigenvectors of L , where U U T = U T U = I . It is easy to see that the graph Laplacian L admits an eigendecomposition [ 8 ] , namely , L = U ΓU T . Hitting time Hij captures the expected number of random walk steps from node i to first hit node j . Commute time is the expected number of random walk steps from node i to first hit node j , and return to node i . Using the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of L , we can compute the hitting times and commute times using the following formula [ 19 ] :

The edges of the graph could exhibit versatile characteristics reflecting various underlying entity relations . On undirected graphs , the edges connecting nodes are symmetric , eg , the friendship relations in Facebook , while on digraphs , the edges are in general asymmetric , eg , the users’ following relations on Twitter , and the hyperlinking relation on the World Wide Web ( WWW ) network . On signed graphs , the edges carry heterogeneous weights , which could be either positive or negative , representing trust and distrust relations among OSN users . This section discusses application problems in three types of graphs , including directed graphs , undirected graphs , and signed graphs . 3.1 Directed graph model
Graphs arising from many applications are directed , where entity connections in a direct graph can be categorized into two types , namely , bi directional links ( mutual connections ) and unidirectional links ( one way connections ) , for example , the users’ following relations on Twitter , and the hyperlinking relations on the World Wide Web ( WWW ) network . Differing from undirected graphs , the direction of links contains crucial information , which makes it challenging to model and characterize such directed complex networks . This section introduces state of the art works in extending and generalizing the standard random walk theory and the intrinsically related spectral graph theory on undirected graphs to digraphs , which is further applied to solve various practical problems in wireless networks . Spectral graph theory for digraphs . Given a directed graph G , its adjacency matrix is in general asymmetric , thus the relations ( ie , eq.(1 ) and ( 2 ) ) between stationary distribution and node degrees no longer hold . Moreover , the Laplacian matrix defined in eq.(3 ) is generally asymmetric , thus not eigen decomposible . [ 12 , 14 ] focuses on ergodic digraph , which is strongly connected and aperiodic , ie , there is a ( directed ) path from any vertex i to any other vertex j , and the Markov chain P has a unique stationary probability distribution . Then , a Diplacian ( digraph laplacian)1 is defined in terms of the node stationary distribution vector in stead of node degree vector ,

( 7 ) where Π = diag[πi ] is the diagonal stationary distribution matrix , and P = [ pij ] is the transition probability matrix . Diplacian matrix ˜L is in general asymmetric and not eigendecomposible . Instead , [ 12 , 14 ] shows that the singular value decomposition of ˜L , ie , ˜L = U ΣV T , captures the spectrum of a digraph , and has close connections to the hitting time and commute time representation , Green ’s function of ˜L , the normalized fundamental matrix [ 19 ] . For example , the hitting time can be computed in terms of the spectum space formed by the singluar values and vectors of ˜L .

In various wireless scenarios , stateless ( stochastic ) routing is commonly used for the ease of implementation and the adaptation to the dynamic changes of network topology . As no routing states are maintained or used , packages are forwarded in a random walk fashion in wireless networks . Given a source destination pair ( s , d ) , any node in the network G may be involved in the forwarding process of a packet . Suppose that node i is the current forwarder . After node i ’s transmission , a subset of its direct neighbors , N ( i ) , may receive the
1A unnormalized digraph Laplacian is defined in [ 2 ] .
1070 packet . For example , the next forwarder may be selected by using a random back off mechanism where each node randomly sets a back off timer value uniformly chosen from [ 0 , t0 ] where t0 is an appropriately chosen contention slot . Hence to track the packet traversals under stateless routing , we see that the packet stays with node i if and only if none of its neighbors receive the packet . This happens with probability pii = Πk(1−aik ) . Otherwise , the packet transits or “ walks ” from node i to node j , j ∈ N ( i ) , with probability pij = aij ( 1 − Πk(1 − aik) ) . Hence we have a Markov Chain with the transition probability matrix P = [ pij ] given below , k aik fl aij
It is easy to verify that k ( 1 − aik )
( 1 − pij = k aik k ( 1 − aik ) ) if i = j if i = j .
( 9 ) j pij = 1 . If the graph is strongly connected and aperiodic , the Markov chain is ergodic . Thus the hitting time Hij captures exactly the expected number of hops needed to transmit a packet from node i to j with stateless routing .
To account for other transmission costs , we introduce a transition cost matrix T = [ Tij ] associated with each one hop transition , Tij ≥ 0,∀i , j . For example , depending on the context and modeling objective , Tii can be used to represent the per node processing/transmission latency , duty cycle delay , or per node energy consumption ; where Tij , j ∈ N ( i ) the one hop forwarding latency , energy consumption , etc . Analogous to the notion of hitting time Hij , we define the hitting cost , H s ij , ( also referred as the sojourn time associated with T ) as the ( expected ) total cost ( or “ delay ” ) incurred by a random walk that starts at node i to first reach node j , where each state at any node k incurring a cost ( delay ) Tkk and each transition from node k to node l incurring a cost ( delay ) of ij satisfies the following recursive Tkl . As in the case of Hij , H s j pijTij as the average transmission cost relation where si = every time a packet visits . kj ) = si +n k=1 pik(Tik + H s k=1 pikH s kj fl n

H s ij = if i = j if i = j .
( 10 ) Hence given the appropriately defined Markov chain for a wireless routing scheme and the transition cost matrix H s , we can use H s sd to capture the ( expected ) total cost of transmission when forwarding a packet from source s to destination d . We note that if Tij = 1 for all i , j , ie , T is the all 1 matrix , then H s The hitting and commute costs can be computed as follows . Given an ( asymmetric ) transition cost matrix T = [ Tij ] , Tij ≥ 0 , with Tij as the per link transition cost , and Tii as the per node transmission cost , define S = diag[si ] a diagonal matrix with j=1 Tijpij as the average transmission cost every time a packet visits . We define the normalized cost Laplacian matrix as ˜Ls = S− 1 + be the ( Penrose Moore ) pseudoinverse of ˜Ls . From eq.(10 ) , the hitting costs H s ij can be computed using ˜Ls si = n

Routing is a critical operation in networks . In the context of data and sensor networks , routing strategies such as shortest path , multipath , and potential based ( “ all path ” ) routing have been developed , which intrinsically represent the tradeoff between the latency and energy dissipation of paths used for routing , namely , shorter paths lead to better routing with low latency , while diffusing traffic along more paths generally reduces energy dissipation . Based on the connection between routing and flow optimization in a network , [ 17 , 18 ] consider networks as undirected graphs and develop a unifying theoretical framework by considering flow optimization with mixed ( weighted ) L1/L2 norms as follows . Consider an n node network as an undirected , weighted graph , G = ( V , E , W ) , where V = {1 , 2,··· , n} is the set of vertices , E is the set of edges , and each edge ( i , j ) is assigned a positive weight wij . As G is undirected , ( i , j ) and ( j , i ) represent the same edge in E , and wij = wji > 0 . Let d = [ s , t ] , s , t ∈ V , denote a sourcedestination ( or source sink ) pair in the network G . A unit network flow goes from source s to destination d is mathematically defined as a function , X : V × V ∈ R+ . θ represents the trade of parameter between L1 and L2 norms .

Let R(θ ) = ( V ( θ ) , E(θ ) ) denote the routing graph induced by X∗(θ ) , a subgraph of G = ( V , E ) , where ( i , j ) ∈ R(θ ) if and only if X∗ ij(θ ) > 0 . Then , X∗(θ ) can be computed by using the graph spectrum , namely , Laplacian matrix L(θ ) = D(θ)−A(θ ) . Moreover , by analyzing the obtained X∗(θ ) with different θ ’s , a surprising result is observed : When varying the trade off parameter θ , the routing graphs induced by the optimal flow solutions span from shortest path to multi path to all path routing – this entire sequence of routing graphs is referred to as the routing continuum . We also develop an efficient iterative algorithm for computing the entire routing continuum . Several generalizations are also considered in [ 17 , 18 ] , with applications to traffic engineering and wireless sensor networks . 3.3 Signed Graph Model
In many online social networks , such as Slashdot and Epinions , the edges ( ie , relations between users ) carry heterogeneous weights , which can be either positive or negative , representing trust ( or friend ) and distrust ( or foe ) relations . These networks are referred to as signed networks , where those signed weights generate new challenges in understanding and studying the underlying network properties . For example , the matrix representation of a signed network , namely , the adjacency matrix is no longer non negative , and it is not clear how the information is propagated on such graphs . [ 9 , 10 ] study the influence diffusion and influence maximization in social networks with both positive and negative relationships . By representing such social networks using signed directed graphs , a novel voter diffusion model is proposed , where the social influence is propogated in a random walk fashion . Initially , each node in the signed network has one of two opposite opinions , ie , “ like ” and “ dislike ” a product . At each step , every node randomly picks one of its outgoing neighbors , and if the edge to this neighbor is positive , the node adopts the neighbor ’s opinion , but if the edge is negative , the node adopts the opposite of the neighbor ’s opinion . Given such a signed voter model , [ 9 , 10 ] investigates if the influence propagation converges over a long term , what the convergence status is ( if it
1071 exists ) , and how to choose initial seed nodes to maximize the long term influence of one opinion vs the other . the diagonal matrix and di = and limt→t−1
Consider a signed directed graph G = ( V , E , A ) , where V is the set of vertices , E is the set of directed edges , and A is the signed adjacency matrix with a positive entry Aij representing that i considers j as a friend or i trusts j , and a negative Aij meaning that i considers j as a foe or i distrusts j . The absolute value |Aij| represents the strength of this trust or distrust relationship . A signed transition matrix is defined as P = D−1A , where D = diag[di ] is j∈V |Aij| is the out degree of node i . A key theorem developed in [ 9 , 10 ] is the convergence analysis on power series of signed transition matrix P , namely , limt→ P t i=0 P i , which has intrinsic relations to the spectrum of signed graphs . Based these results , [ 9 , 10 ] develop a complete characterization of the short term and long term dynamics of the signed voter model , and efficient algorithms to solve both shortterm and long term influence maximization problems . 4 . FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Spectral graph theory , as an enabling tool , can be used to solve a broad range of application problems in complex networks . Going beyond the existing works discussed above , it is interesting to investigate spectral graph theory in multi attributed complex networks .
Entities in complex networks usually possess multiple attributes that reflect their different characteristics , for example , the numbers of users , who follow and be followed by a Twitter user , indicate the popularity and the activeness of the Twitter user , respectively . The emphasis in complex networks has been on analyzing and characterizing individual attributes separately , eg , degree distributions as univariate distributions , which have implications on issues such as social influence , community formation , resilience , and epidemics . However , multivariate phenomena that arise as a result of repeated non linear interactions among its participants are mostly ignored , where valuable information about the correlations across different network attributes is lost . Thus , bringing multivariate probabilistic models and analytics to bear in complex network analysis will provide a more rigorous theoretical underpinning , and will lead to deeper insights into many network phenomena . Thus , it is interesting to investigate the spectral graph properties of multiattributed networks , with which as theoretical foundations to design efficient algorithms to characterize the multivariate statistics and structures of complex networks through sampling , eg , joint in and out degree distributions . The results by analyzing the sampled data will infer correlations and causality in complex networks , which in turn have implications in revealing more precise network evolution process with respect to multiple attributes , and uncovering hidden social communities in the underlying networks . 5 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we introduce the spectral graph theory , a powerful tool in analyzing various complex networks , as directed , undirected , and signed graphs . We discuss a variety of application problems in wireless networks , Internet traffic engineering , and influence diffusion in social networks . we also hightlight some future directions to further extend and develop spectral graph theory in more general settings , such as multi attributed networks . This paper aims to help the community better understand and explore this nascent area . 6 . ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
