ABSTRACT In this paper , we present a framework that combines automatic and manual approaches to discover themes in disaster related tweets . As case study , we decided to focus on tweets related to typhoon Haiyan , which caused billions of dollars in damages . We collected tweets from November 2013 to March 2014 and used the local typhoon name “ Yolanda ” as the filter . Data association was used to expand the tweet set and k means clustering was then applied . Clusters with high number of instances were subjected to open coding for labeling . The Silhouette indices ranged from 0.27 to 050 Analyses reveal that the use of automated Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) approach has the potential to deal with huge volumes of tweets by clustering frequently occurring words and phrases . This complements the manual approach to surface themes from a more manageable set of tweet pool , allowing for a more nuanced analysis of tweets from a human expert . As application , the themes identified during open coding were used as labels to train a classifier system . Future work could explore on using topic models and focusing on specific content or issues , such as natural calamities and citizen ’s participation in addressing these .

1 . INTRODUCTION Twitter is one of the most popular networking sites with 600 million active users1 ( nb , both registered and visiting ) . Used as a written virtual account of significant events as well as a powerful tool for communication , it is considered as a veritable gold mine of data ; most especially in times of disasters . Recent studies [ 3 ] , [ 23 ] have shown that social media activity never stops even during a disaster – affected communities post contents to social medias , which allow individuals to watch videos , see photos and read status updates from ground zero . These types of posts – along with people who are observing the event and are also posting in these mediums – make social media interesting . In this regard , Twitter is useful to organizations concerned with relief efforts for valuable information and for purposes of information dissemination [ 19 ] . There is an increasing interest to make sense out of these data , which are often voluminous , unorganized and unstructured . Also , manual analyses are timeconsuming and overwhelming . Given these constraints , we sought to develop a framework that combines manual and automatic approaches to extract themes from disaster related twitter data . In this paper , we therefore seek to address this problem : how do we apply automatic approaches in doing manual analysis of Twitter Data ?
2 . RELATED WORK Twitter is a type of social networking site that allows individuals to send and read short messages known as tweets . The maximum length of a tweet is 140 characters , making Twitter an ideal medium for self expressions and announcements [ 13 ] . In contradistinction to being merely consumers of media , Twitter also serves as a participatory medium for ordinary users to engage in the creation of content during important news events [ 7 ] . It is this reason that a number of studies have focused on analyzing Twitter use and content . In the succeeding texts , we present studies that utilized manual approaches , automatic approaches , and a combination of both approaches .
2.1 Manual Approaches Manual analysis is often qualitative in nature ; emphasizing on indepth information and knowledge . Previous studies include the
1 http://twopchartscom/twitter500millionphp
1239 use of open coding on 4,915 tweets to determine the type of information shared by police departments on Twitter [ 12 ] ; the application of content analysis on a sample of Hurricane Sandy tweets to study the phases of emergency management [ 32 ] ; studying the potential of Twitter for building a civil society network in the context of disaster relief during typhoon Ketsana [ 24 ] ; or managing public relations with social media users in the context of organizational relief efforts in Haiti [ 33 ] . Given the focus on exploring hidden meanings and discourses behind texts , manual interpretive analysis of Twitter messages may be time consuming and can be applied to a limited amount of data [ 31 ] . It is against this scenario that scientists resort to automatic approaches to systematically handle large data and to come up with a limited data pool that can be used for in depth analysis using qualitative methods .
2.2 Automatic Approaches Automatic approaches utilize mathematical representations to analyze data ; expressing results in terms of numbers and their equivalent meaning . An example is sentiment analysis . Being one of the “ hottest research areas in computer science ” [ 6 ] , a number of papers have been written on the topic . Examples include the analysis of election related tweets using a sentiment lexicon to predict election outcome [ 22 ] , [ 35 ] ; and agenda setting via Twitter during Presidential elections [ 36 ] , or in framing political issues [ 25 ] . Other studies that utilized automatic approaches include the classification of disaster related tweets into resource coordination , urgent rescue needed , urgent rescue resolution , damage reporting , missing people , and media storm coverage using Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines or SVM [ 19 ] ; the use of Walktrap algorithm to detect community structures [ 9 ] ; detection of flood related tweets using SVM [ 2 ] ; and the use of Naïve Bayes and SVM classification combined with clustering for studying emergency situations [ 38 ] . One study [ 14 ] also surveyed a number of automatic approaches and found key weaknesses ; while certain approaches can handle voluminous data , such as the case in sentiment analysis studies , they are dependent on the training data in which they were trained .
2.3 Combined Approaches A number of earlier works have combined manual and automatic approaches to address each approach ’s weakness . One instance is the application of software aided semantic content analysis [ 20 ] to study dimensions of information quality . In this related study , CATPAC – a software that utilizes neural networks – was used to identify frequently occurring phrases and keywords . Another study [ 16 ] combined manual coding and automated sentiment analysis on 150,000 microblog postings to study word of mouth branding while others utilized tools as aid in doing manual analysis and presenting results [ 28 ] , [ 37 ] . In these research works , automatic approaches have been utilized as guides for manual analysis . There is also an existing work that utilized crowd sourcing to annotate data [ 15 ] .
3 . CASE STUDY To address the research problem , we developed a framework that combines manual and automatic approaches to discover themes . It involves ( 1 ) filtering the data using certain keywords ; ( 2 ) clustering the filtered tweets ; and ( 3 ) labeling the clusters using open coding with language models as guide .

As a case study , we focused on typhoon Haiyan , a category 5 typhoon with a maximum of 145 mph 10 minute sustained winds . It caused billions of dollars in damages and more than 6,000 fatalities2 in the Philippines alone . Known locally as Yolanda , it made landfall in the Philippines on November 07 , 2013 . Millions of tweets were sent before , during , and after the typhoon . The succeeding texts detail the filtering process .
3.1 Collection Twitter data , from November 2013 to March 2014 , that have geolocations ( latitude , longitude ) originating from Metro Manila were collected using a program based on Twitter4J3 , a Java library for the Twitter API . From these tweets , we selected those containing the term “ Yolanda ” . The number of tweets is shown in Table 1 . Considering several holidays , tweets for November and December ( see second column ) are surprisingly low .
3.2 Expanding the Tweet Set We decided to expand the tweet set by mining related keywords using data association , a process of learning relations between variables in a dataset [ 1 ] . A relation or an association rule , defined in ( 1 ) , works on the notion of an antecedent X resulting in a consequent Y with particular support and confidence .
}{
}{ X → Y
( 1 )
For this study , we applied the data association technique used in a related work [ 34 ] . The data set is first modeled in terms of 6grams and association rule mining is applied on the 6 grams : where X is “ yolanda ” and Y is another keyword . Among the different keywords , two were selected because of their high confidence values , shown in Table 2 . Confidence , shown in ( 2 ) , is defined as the support for occurrences of X and Y over the support for occurrence X . A higher confidence value means Y is usually seen with X .

3.3 Pre Processing To remove insignificant white spaces and to tokenize the tweets , regular expressions and the following Moses scripts [ 18 ] were used : tokenizer.perl – inserts spaces between words and punctuations clear corpus n.perl – removes white spaces
All tweets were then converted to lower case and the tweets were transformed into values using Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency or TF IDF [ 30 ] , a weighting scheme that takes into account the spread of a term throughout the entire set of documents . Terms are then pruned and a vector space model [ 21 ] is produced . In this process , the following are removed in the order specified :
Table 4 . Number of tweets per cluster
Function words ;
Month
Cluster Number of tweets
Terms with low document frequency values ( DF ) ;
Terms with high IDF values ;
URLs ( terms beginning in “ http ” ) ; and
Other special characters ( eg , terms with less than two characters and are non alphanumeric ) .
These were deemed as adding noise , irrelevant or too frequently occurring , and do not provide any discriminating information .
3.4 k means Clustering Once the data has been transformed into a vector space , k means clustering [ 10 ] – a process of partitioning a tweet set into k clusters – is applied on each month . The tweet set was separated per month for purposes of time series analysis . To minimize the bias of the model to the seed documents , simulated annealing [ 5 ] was used . The presence of the bias could deter the results of the clustering due to local maxima . For this research , ten simulations were performed per tweet set per value of k . R4 , a computer environment , was used to automate these processes . The number of tweets per cluster per month is shown in Table 4 . As k means clustering groups related tweets together , only those clusters with the highest number of tweets per month were selected for manual analysis as these contain the majority of the discussion . The selected clusters were underlined in the table .
3.5 Labeling using Open Coding To label the selected clusters , open coding was used ; language models and a list of action words were utilized as a guide . The following texts show how we came up with the labels . is
351 Language Modeling Language modeling the process of creating smaller representations of a document and is composed of n grams and the number of times they appeared in the document . The standard formulation [ 27 ] for an n gram is as follows : given a sentence S composed of different words , S={s1so} , word sequences T={t1tn} is an n gram of S if there exists a strictly incrementing

Only these were selected as expanding the tweet set with too many keywords may introduce too much noise ( ie , tweets not related to typhoon Haiyan ) . Using “ Yolanda ” , the two related keywords , and the international name “ Haiyan ” as filters , the tweet set was expanded . Table 3 shows the number of tweets per month . The expanded tweet set contains a total of 7,607 tweets . It can be noted that the numbers start to decline after two months . This reflects the intensity of tweets at the time when the disaster struck up to a month after the disaster when information dissemination and coordination was at its peak in providing relief services to victims . It may also indicate a decline in attention on Typhoon Yolanda among twitter users starting the first quarter of 2014 . Further analysis of the content of tweets is necessary to determine the nature of tweets as time progresses .
After filtering , the tweets are pre processed . This entails the ( 1 ) removal of insignificant white spaces ; ( 2 ) proper tokenization of tweets ; ( 3 ) conversion of all tweets to lower case ; ( 4 ) transforming
1241 sequence p1pn of indices of S such that for all q=1n , S
. 1 grams up to 6 grams of each selected cluster were p q
=
T q generated using SRILM5 . In addition , English and Tagalog action words were identified in the unigrams using a tagger dictionary [ 26 ] .
352 Open Coding Open coding involves breaking down the data into distinct ideas , events or objects and assigning codes [ 8 ] . Once the codes of the data have been formulated , they are again analyzed and grouped together forming categories . The categories are used in formulating labels or themes . With language modeling and partof speech tagging as guides , the n grams and list of action words already act as codes , simplifying the process . Also , the rank and frequency counts of each n gram provide a certain level of importance ; giving emphasis on unique keywords that emerge frequently .
4 . DISCUSSION Among the different phases of emergency management [ 32 ] , analyses of the different clusters reveal only recovery ( see Table 5 for the different labels ) . In the Philippines , recovery pertains to the short term and long term actions to rehabilitate the affected community and reconstruct infrastructure to restore services . Sample n grams are shown in Table 6 . The different n grams for NOV 2013 C1 pertain to identifying people affected by the typhoon . These mostly indicated concern over the disaster victims and the need for help to be extended to them . Mobilizing assistance for the victims was carried over to Cluster 2 DEC 2013 C2 . In said cluster , however , concrete assistance emerge in the form of fund raising and holding events such as concerts and benefit shows for the typhoon victims . With the advent of a new year , the damage brought by the typhoon had been fully assessed . This shows the focus of the n grams on death tolls in JAN 2014 C3 . It took some time as damage was widespread . To show gratitude to the international response provided , a thank you campaign was launched in February ; explaining the predominance of expressions of gratitude ( “ thank you ” ) in FEB 2014 C2 ngrams . Finally , in March 2014 , we noted an attention shift away from discussion about the victims or about the state of disaster affected communities . A majority of the tweets focused on the “ celebrification ” of disaster assistance , as the posts highlighted not the act of humanitarian assistance , but on the celebrities involved and the spectacle that the fund raising activities raised . “ Celebrification ” is a term coined to refer to the active use of celebrity factor on behavior , and on the perception by an individual of a person or an idea , as an effect of the ‘parasocial’ interaction with the personalities of popular entertainment media [ 4 ] , [ 11 ] . This was apparent in the attention given to the amount of donations , as well as the focus on popular personalities providing assistance to the affected communities in the month of March 2014 .

5 . EVALUATION AND LIMITATION To evaluate the different clusters , we used a measure for cohesion ( ie , which tweets lie within a cluster and which are marginal ) – the Silhouette index or SIL [ 17 ] . Defined in ( 3 ) , where a(i ) is the average similarity of tweet i with other tweets in the cluster , and b(i ) is the minimum average distance of tweet i in other clusters , SIL is a value between 1 and 1 with 1 being the best value . The number of tweets and Silhouette indices per cluster per month is shown in Table 7 . The Silhouette indices ranged from 0.27 to
1242 050 The results indicate that there are varieties in discussions per cluster . It is important to note that although automatic processes allow the processing of voluminous data , they do not necessarily constitute complete data [ 29 ] . We used filtering processes that facilitate a dataset representing only a portion of the sample universe ( ie , Metro Manila ; using the keywords Yolanda , Haiyan , victims , and typhoon ; disregarding tweets that do not identify location ) . The tweet pool also does not recognize tweets repeatedly sent by robots . Finally , the clusters are identified on the basis of frequency . In the context of disasters , however , there are certain words that naturally emerge as frequent ( ie , typhoon , disaster , victim ) . Thus , higher values for n ( eg , 7gram and 8 gram ) could also be meaningful for analysis because they provide more contexts . There is also a need to prune out function words to facilitate the emergence of more meaningful data for further manual analysis . Nonetheless , automated methods for data analysis are becoming increasingly valuable due to the possibility of generating insights from voluminous datasets that would appear to be onerous using other methods . Thus , the potential of automated methods has been demonstrated in terms of managing datasets and generating first level thematic analyses from data obtained from a broad time frame .

6 . APPLICATION Using the themes found in the typhoon related tweets , a web application6 that uses Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) was developed . Such a web application may be useful if there is interest in being able to quickly look for tweets that fall under certain themes . For example , some agencies may be interested in finding tweets about victims and the assistance they need , in which tweets under the theme “ Victim Identification ; Mobilizing Assistance for Disaster Victims ” will be relevant . The web application then looks for tweets in real time and categorizes them . As such , the concerned agencies only need to monitor the application for updates . Of course , automatic classification will not be perfect , and tweets may be classified erroneously . Despite this , automatic classifiers still provide a faster and easier way of looking for tweets as opposed to manual methods . One possible extension is a Philippine map with victims’ needs plotted out on that map .
