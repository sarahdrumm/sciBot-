ABSTRACT We propose a new link injection method aiming at boosting the overall diffusion of information in social networks . Our approach is based on a diffusion coverage score of the ability of each user to spread information over the network . Candidate links for injection are identified by a matrix factorization technique and link injection is performed by attaching links to users according to their score . We additionally perform clustering to identify communities in order to inject links that cross the boundaries of such communities . In our experiments with five real world networks , we demonstrate that our method can significantly spread the information diffusion by performing limited link injection , essential to real world applications .

INTRODUCTION
The diffusion of information in social networks supports communication for the exchange of ideas or opinions . Although information can spread effectively inside tightly coupled communities , it may hardly propagate beyond their boundaries [ 2 ] . Despite the focus of research on the identification of influential spreaders , eg for viral marketing applications [ 5 ] , it may not be possible to frequently engage such influential users . Thus , the vast majority of informationdiffusion processes are initiated by “ regular ” users ( ie , noninfluential spreaders ) and is bound to be restrained within the small circle of friends inside a community .
Our approach identifies a limited number of new social links that can be injected to help in spreading information outside community boundaries . In this respect , our approach is related to users recommendation algorithms [ 3 ] , such as Friend of Friend ( FoF ) schemes . However , existing user recommendation algorithms do not focus on optimizing information diffusion . More related to our work the approach of [ 2 ] recommends connections to boost information diffusion based on knowledge about users’ profiles and the content being shared among users , which may not be available due to , eg , privacy issues . Our approach does not employ knowledge about users’ preferences and is based only on the network structure . Furthermore , it controls more tightly the number of the injected links . In this paper , we extend our preliminary approach [ 1 ] , by directly considering the structure of communities to inject links that can cross their boundaries .

PROPOSED APPROACH Provided a graph G=(N ; L ) with N nodes and L edges and the respective adjacency matrix A ∈ R|N|×|N| , our DNL model [ 1 ] performs link injection for boosting informa′ ∈ R|N|×|N| matrix , tion diffusion , by constructing a new A which corresponds to a new graph G ) , on condition that the number of the new injected links |L ∩ L ′| is small . DNL consists of the following steps : Diffusion coverage score : the top k set S ⊂ N of nodes are identified , where |S| ≪ |N| is the subset of the most influential nodes with the highest diffusion coverage . The diffusion coverage for each node j ∈ N is denoted as ∆(j ) and represents the importance of node j for the flow of information that can spread over graph G . To measure the impact of each node we compute the robustness of graph G after the node removal . We follow the principle of interlacing , which is expressed by the Perron Frobenius theorem and states that the first ( largest ) eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix reduces when removing a node or a link . Non negative matrix factorization : We factorize the adjacency matrix A ∈ R|N|×|N| according to a non Negative Matrix Factorization ( NMF ) technique , generating a new matrix ANM F ∈ R|N|×|N| with ANM F = W U , where W ∈ R|N|×D , U ∈ RD×|N| , and D is the number of latent factors . Link assignment : Finally , the new links of ANM F with the highest likelihood are selected based on a link assign′ ment algorithm , generating the final adjacency matrix A . Depending on the link injection strategy , a predefined maximum number of links m is defined . Let LS be the set of the links currently existing to the top k nodes of the set S , with LS ⊂ L , then the predefined threshold m is expressed as m = |LS|× p , where p is a constant factor . The inputs of the algorithm are ( i ) the ∆ diffusion coverage scores of the top k nodes of set S ( step 1 ) ; ( ii ) matrix ANM F ( step 2 ) ; ( iii ) constant factor p for threshold m and ( iv ) an upper bound ub for each node , with the number of links that each node can ′ be injected . After initializing A with the existing links of A , the algorithm constructs a B ∈ R|S|×|N| matrix , where each i th row corresponds to the top k nodes of the set S and each j th column to all N nodes . The algorithm scans all nodes in S and tries to inject links , ie insert new pairs in matrix , based on the highest score B(i ; j ) = ∆(i)·ANMF(i ; j ) as ′ A well as with the highest ∆(j ) score of the j th column , on condition that the new < i ; j > link does not already exist ′ in A and does not violate any of the two constrains based on threshold m and upper bound ub for both i and j nodes . L DNL : Although the DNL model can increase the spread of cascades , it ignores the isolated communities of the network , requiring thus more links to cross the communities’ boundaries . To handle this problem we propose a variant of DNL , namely L DNL , where a clustering algorithm is included to identify users’ communities . Thus , prior to the link assignment algorithm , the nodes of the graphs are clustered . Next , for each link in ANM F , a matrix C ∈ R|N|×|N| is constructed with C(i ; j)=1 , if link < i ; j > connects two different clusters/communities and 0 otherwise . Finally , over the scan of the score matrix B , we set B(i ; j ) = ∆(i ) · ANMF(i ; j ) + C(i ; j ) , promoting thus new links < i ; j > that cross the communities boundaries .
3 . EXPERIMENTS
Datasets : We used five real datasets : Ciao and Epinions [ 7 ] , Twitter [ 8 ] , YouTube [ 9 ] , and Facebook [ 10 ] . Their statistics are summarized in Table 1 . Each connection between two users is weighted according to the information they share , eg , amount of wall posts in Facebook , retweets in Twitter , etc .

Results : In our experiments , we considered the PageRank algorithm as the default seed selection strategy in the information diffusion process . We evaluated the basic DNL model and its variant L DNL against the case where no new connections are being inserted , denoted as PageRank and a Random selection baseline , where the same number of links is assigned to randomly selected graph nodes . We examine the Independent Cascade ( IC ) and Linear Threshold ( LT ) models [ 6 ] . The default value for the ‘stopping probability’ in the diffusion models is set to 0.25 , ie , a user propagates the information if 75 % of his neighbors have been already activated . In our experiments we report average results out of 100 trials , since the examined diffusion models are probabilistic . In Figures 1(a) (b ) we evaluate the impact of the proposed DNL and L DNL on the IC and LT models , in terms of the number of user activations , ie , users that have received and accepted the information furnished by the underlying information diffusion model . In this experiment , we set m = 1 × |LS| and k = 0:1 × |N| , with |LS| being the number of the existing edges in of top k nodes in S and |N| the number of nodes in the network . For both IC and LT the proposed DNL and L DNL boost information diffusion for all datasets , while L DNL outperforms DNL by promoting injecting links that cross the communities’ boundaries .

To evaluate the performance of L DNL against DNL , in Figure 2 we examine the relative increase of activated users that L DNL achieves , by varying the number of injected links . In particular , the constant factor is varied in p=[0.5 1 1.5 2 ] for threshold m = p×|LS| , corresponding to different percentages of link injection of the total graph ’s edges %|L| .

4 . CONCLUSIONS
Our link injection method can significantly boost information diffusion in social networks , especially when promoting to inject links that cross the boundaries of users’ communities . For future work we will evaluate the sensitivity of our method wrt the probability that the ( recommended ) link injection by our collaborative filtering approach would be accepted by users in a real case study . Also , we will examine the performance of our method on large cascade sizes that can reach a large portion of the network [ 4 ] .
