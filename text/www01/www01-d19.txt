ABSTRACT Current Network User Interfaces ( NUIs ) provide entrances to an enormous amount of Web based services , bringing about new use problems such as laborious and unsuccessful navigation . Such problems are generally more severe for users with regression of cognitive functions ( eg for some elderly ) . This paper identifies four fundamental cognitive determinants of navigation performance that may explain these problems : situation awareness , spatial ability , task set switching and user control of support . Based on an analysis of these demands and current support functions for navigation , three “ refined ” support concepts were developed : categorising landmarks , history map and navigation assistant . Via the specification of humancomputer co operative processes and scenarios , the concepts were implemented for two rather different web based services . The present paper provides an example implementation of the navigation assistant . The results of the study will feed into a cognitive engineering method for the design of NUIs .

INTRODUCTION The user interface technology is developing in a new direction mainly due to the utilisation of the Internet via the so called World Wide Web . The Web or network user interface ( NUI ) contains hyperlinks to corresponding information providing information in several formats , such as text , graphics , photos , audio and video . The NUI offers a browser like interface to search for the multimedia information in databases that are situated at several locations and interconnected via several paths , while the database content is timely . For example , users can navigate in a 3D world , can interact with 3D objects and can be informed about process changes from remote systems by intelligent agents . The user tasks in such a Web environment consist of monitoring or exploring whether possible important information is present , assessing the meaning and relevance of the information given the current situation and task objectives , and , if needed , making decisions based on this assessment such as further exploration or

StevenPemberton@cwinl interaction to bring human computer buying a product . Several search strategies can be distinguished with network user interfaces . In a 'random search’ there is no particular order observable . By ‘scanning’ users sample different parts of the hypermedia databases without systematically exploring any part in depth . In ‘spike exploration’ the users follow link pathways , although the search may not be directed to any specific goal , and sidetracks are evident in the trace of the user ’s search . Finally , in ‘searching’ exploration follows pathways in a directed manner towards an information seeking goal . Fewer diversions down sidetracks occur in searching ( Sutcliffe , 1995 ) . New usability bottlenecks appear when users perform their tasks with the NUIs , such as inefficient navigation , disorientation and loss of overview ( Nielsen , 1995 ) . Such problems are generally more severe for users with regression of cognitive functions ( eg for some elderly ; Neerincx , 1998 ) . To overcome such problems and realise usable interactive products , user interface designers should apply guidelines and structured methods . Cognitive and usability engineering methods have been developed ( HCI ) knowledge into the software development life cycle ( eg Mayhew , 1999 ; Vora , 1998 ) . A major problem is that a large number of guidelines have been developed in the HCI field that may guide software development , but is overlap , inconsistency and deficiency ( Ratner et al . , 1996 ) . A particular deficiency that is currently being addressed is the availability of a coherent set of “ universal accessibility ” guidelines . These guidelines are presented separately in handbooks and other publications to improve the designers’ awareness of the “ design for all ” approach , but still have to be integrated into the design practice ( Czaja , 1997 ; Newell & Gregor , 1997 ; Small , 1987 ; Vanderheiden , 1997 ) . Especially for universal accessibility and NUI characteristics , theory and empirical research are lacking that validate the proposed guidelines . In the U WISH ( Usability of Web based Information Services for Hypermedia ) project , three research institutes and four companies that provide Web based services are developing a cognitive engineering method focusing on the enhancement of individual navigation performance in the services , including elderly ( Neerincx et al . , 1999 ; http://wwwcwinl/projects/uwish ) First , a theoretical basis of navigation performance in Webenvironments is proposed : the crucial cognitive factors that affect effectiveness , efficiency and satisfaction in navigation tasks . Based on this practical theory , user requirements for navigation support are identified and mapped on the support functions that current NUI technology provides . Subsequently , new promising support concepts are specified and implemented . there
119 USER REQUIREMENTS FOR NAVIGATION SUPPORT Cognitive factor Situation awareness comprises person ’s momentary knowledge of the surroundings and his or her presence in it . This knowledge can be described at three levels : the perception of the elements in the environment within a volume of time and space , the comprehension of their meaning , and the projection of their status in the near future ( Endsley , 1995 ) . At the level of perception , an almost infinite number of data and services is spread around the world . The content and even its location changes over time continuously . People get lost in information spaces and can suffer from information overload . Errors at the comprehension level result from a lack of understanding of the perceived data in the light of users’ goals . Data are presented most often in one way to a wide variety of users with different domain knowledge and goals , and consequently several user groups can have difficulties in interpreting the content . At the projection level , a fully developed mental model is required for adequate performance . For Web based services it is particularly difficult to know when to search for new or updated information or products .
Requirement NUIs should enhance the perception and comprehension during Web navigation by fitting the ( combinations ) of media for information presentation with the current user task , and by displaying information about the current task context . In particular , multi media enrichment may reduce the required effort to learn the Web content and context support the effort to interpret the information in terms of the current user goal . Improvements of projection of non specific or failing goals on near future NUI states can be realised by goal refinement and goal creation functions .
Cognitive factor The spatial ability and memory of users prove to affect the performance of computer based tasks . Users with poor spatial ability have more problems with navigation in Web sites , requiring extra search and navigation support ( Chen & Rada , 1996 ; Czaja , 1997 ) . Höök et al . ( 1996 ) found that spatial ability is related to the time spent in completing a set of tasks in a large , hypermedia , information structure . Particularly , certain aspects of spatial ability were related to the ability to navigate in hypermedia , namely those related to solving spatial problems mentally rather than solving spatial problems in the physical world . Recently we conducted an experiment in which old participants ( 50 and up ) proved to perform substantially worse on a spatial ability test then the young participants ( between 18 and 30 ) . These participants performed a number of different information seeking tasks in a Web site . The subjective mental effort that was required to perform the tasks proved to be higher for elderly . Furthermore , the elderly developed a worse mental model of the Web site structure : they made more errors when they had to categorise Web pages in the site structure after the navigation tasks .
Requirement NUIs should provide spatial representations that reduce the demands on spatial ability . Such representations can reduce the required mental effort for navigation tasks and improve the users mental model of the Web site . In particular for elderly , large effects on navigation performance can be expected . is often required for optimal
Cognitive factor Task set switching task management and interleaving is an important aspect of humancomputer interaction ( Cypher , 1986 ) . However , users are inclined to concentrate on one task set and neglect another task set ( "cognitive lockup" ) . Furthermore , switching can be a major mental load factor in itself and elderly seem to have generally less capacity for switching ( Kramer et al . , 1999 ; Sit & Fisk , 1999 ) .
Requirement NUIs should provide a scheduler that can help users to focus on a new task and , subsequently , to return to the first one . In particular for elderly , large effects on navigation performance can be expected .
Cognitive factor Users’ capacities and preferences differ , so that their support needs may change . Furthermore , a user learns , individual preferences change and task demands vary . Consequently , support needs will alter in time .
Requirement The users should have control of the level of support , so that they can attune this level to their momentary needs .
ANALYSIS After the specification of the user requirements , Web design experts of the CWI research institute and the General Design company analysed the navigation support functions that are currently being applied . First , they identified 15 support functions that could be divided in 5 classes , and compared them to the user requirements ( Table I ) . The sitemap is related to most of the user requirements and the agent also covers a lot of them , whereas current directories , search and highlighting are only related to one or two requirements . Second , the goal of the U WISH project is to develop a theory , guidelines , techniques and tools that allow web based services to be tailored to changing user profiles and task sets . In order to fulfil this objective , the adaptations were compared with the following cognitive engineering objectives :
•
•
•
It should be feasible to expect that the candidate adaptation has a substantial effect .
The candidate adaptation should be generic enough to be applied to a range of web based services .
It should be feasible to expect that the candidate adaptation will be able to assist in the tasks of both novice and expert users .
120 Table II shows that the positive effects on navigation can be high for the sitemap , landmarks and agents . Third , there are implementation costs . A support function with an anticipated large effect that is easy to implement should have preference over an adaptation with a small anticipated effect that is hard to implement .
•
•
•
•
Several factors influence the technical complexity : Implementing the support function might call for additional hardware , special software , exclusive plugins , or specific Web server configurations .
If extensive domain knowledge is necessary , or if empirical information needs to be gathered before the support function can be implemented , then the domain complexity is high .
Some functions by their nature cannot be generated and have to be compiled by hand . Such functions are termed high in editorial complexity . They usually require further editorial investment in the event of the structure of the site changing . is the range of different
The scope functional approaches covered by the term , this range is one of function and also quality . The smaller the scope the more precise implementation effort can be estimated . the
Table II shows that especially the implementation of the agent is rather complex , mainly due to its broad scope . Based on the criteria of tables I and II , with priority given to the number of user requirements covered and the estimated effects , four sample functions were selected for further investigation : landmarks , history list , sitemap and agent . These functions cover the most user requirements and comply for the main part with the cognitive engineering objective . Only the agent is rather difficult to implement ; in particular , the scope of this function should be more focussed for implementation .
SYNTHESIS After choosing the functions to elaborate on and based on the user requirements , we refined them into three support concepts . In other words , the four existing functions were combined and further developed to address the cognitive factors of navigation performance better resulting in the following promising support concepts :
•
•
•
The categorising landmarks cover style elements linked to the structure of the site , such as visual landmarks ( Vinson , 1999 ) or musical navigational cues , 'emons’ ( Nemirovsky & Davenport , 1999 ) . Such cues are added to the user interface to support the users in recognising their presence in a certain part of a web site ( ie it orders information into categories that are meaningful for the user task ) . This should help the users to perceive the information in meaningful clusters and prevent them from getting lost . the
The history map is an add on to a web based service . The basis for the history map is a sitemap : a graphical representation of the structure of a web site where the layout elements ( colour , placement , and size type ) indicate how is clustered and structured . History information , such as currently provided by Web browsers is integrated into the sitemap . This memory aid should improve users’ comprehension of the service ’s structure in relation to their task and provide information about the status of their various sub goals .
( Berkun , 1999 ) , information
The navigation assistant has knowledge of the domain ( the content of the web based service ) and current user ( such as interests , profession , education , age and transport constraints ) . By means of this knowledge the assistant is able to dynamically provide advice to the individual user . This interface concept should help the user to focus on relevant information for the current task .
The map of the support functions on the three levels of situation awareness is rather straightforward ( table III ) . The landmarks act on the level of perception and should help to categorise the Web content according to the specific task demands . The history map acts on the level of comprehension and should help to memorise central elements of task performances according to the specific task demands . The assistant acts on the projection level and should help to set the focus on a specific task object according to the specific task demands .

EXAMPLE DESIGN OF SUPPORT FUNCTION A cognitive engineering framework is being applied to design and implement the three support concepts ( Neerincx et al . , 1999 ) . According to this framework , interface design is a topdown process consisting of two phases that provide the corresponding user interface specification at two levels . In the first phase , based on users’ goals and information needs , the system ’s functions and information provision are specified ( ie the task level of the user interface is established ) . In the second phase , the control of the functions and the presentation of the information the communication level of the user interface is established ) . The three support concepts were implemented for two Web based services that have been under consideration in the U WISH the “ look and feel ” or is specified ( ie project : a standard , static web site ( 'flat’ HTML ) , and a web site involving a 3D world ( based on VRML technology ) . This section provides a brief overview of the design of a navigation assistant for the first Web site .
The Navigation Assistant at the Task Level The proposed navigation assistant has knowledge of the domain ( the content of the web based service ) and current user ( such as interests , profession , current task , education , age and transport constraints ) . By means of this knowledge the assistant is able to dynamically provide advice to the individual user . The goal of the navigation assistant is to help the user focus on relevant information for the current task .
123 Figure 1 : The joint execution behaviour of three actors : user , content provider and navigation assistant .
Figure 1 provides the human computer co operation model , describing the joint human computer execution process and the role of the navigation assistant ( De Greef & Neerincx , 1995 ; Neerincx & De Greef , 1998 ) . Note that this model represents the roles of user and system in the execution process for one cycle . During or after such a process , a new process can be started . The model shows that the user can interact with the content provider , such as a web server ( request(CP ) ) or the navigation assistant ( request(NA) ) , and that the navigation assistant forwards the last types of requests to the content provider . A request can be an URL address and the Content Provider provides the response such as a specific Web page . The navigation assistant retains user requests and sets the focus on specific content . The focus is based on the user request history , the profile that users can provide and the domain knowledge of the available content . Several scenarios ( ie implementations of this model ) were specified for the support functions . The next section provides an example storyboard for the navigation assistant .
The Navigation Assistant at the Communication Level A new browser was installed on the company network of Stefan , a researcher working for a large aircraft manufacturer . When he starts the browser , the navigation assistant asks for user profile information in exchange for improved navigation performance . Stefan is an experienced web surfer but he still looses track once in a while . So , he decides to fill in his profile . First , he provides the assistant with information about himself . Stefan can place restrictions on various items of his profile . In the example Stefan chooses to make his ‘LastName’ only available for services after explicit permission ( Figure 2 ) . Stefan also adds information to the profile about his profession and general interests ( Figure 3 ) . Once he finishes filling in his profile he decides to take a look at the web site of TNO TM which a friend told him about . The navigation assistant detects that it ’s Stefan ’s first time on the TNO TM web site and tells him that there is a guided tour available ( Figure 4 ) . Stefan starts to follow the guided tour , but suddenly he realises that he has an appointment . He finishes the guided tour quickly and turns off his computer . The next day Stefan visits the TNO TM site again . The assistant detects that it is Stefan and he welcomes him . Stefan is looking for defence related projects so he enters ‘Defence’ as the current task keyword . The navigation assistant provides him with a link to information that is especially relevant for Stefan and his current task ( Figure 5 ) . Stefan reads the material on 3D perspective cockpit displays . When he has finished reading , he closes the browser .
124 Implementation The navigation assistant provides advice that consists of hyperlinks to information that is relevant for a specific user at a specific state . The current implementation of the navigation assistant consists of two parts : an assistant and a co assistant ( see figure 6 ) . The assistant contains the user profile , the advice history and task information , and is integrated into the browser .
This part also provides the user interface of the navigation assistant . The co assistant is located on the side of the content provider preferably on the same machine as the web server . The co assistant contains domain knowledge about the content of the service , session histories of current and previous users , and a rule base that is able to provide a focus based on this information and the user information gathered from the user profile part of the navigation assistant .

Figure 3 : Providing the navigation assistant with his profession
Figure 4 : The navigation assistant suggests the guided tour
125 Figure 5 : The navigation assistant suggests a relevant project .
Figure 6 : The architecture of the implemented system
In summary , the navigation assistant provides advice during user ’s navigation based on knowledge of the user , the current user task and the web content . Whereas the Web watcher of Joachims et al . ( 1997 ) set the focus locally ( ie within the content of a Web page ) , the navigation assistant sets the focus onto the content of other pages ( and possibly pages of another web site that has a co assistant ) .
CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION The Network User Interface ( NUI ) provides new possibilities to enhance the accessibility of Web based services for information or commerce , but also proves to bring about new use problems such as disorientation , loss of overview . Cognitive engineering theory and methods are needed to software integrate human computer laborious navigation and interaction into
126 development and thus help to reduce such problems . The theory should be the basis of design guidelines and should consist of specification and assessment techniques that address these guidelines at each development stage . The U WISH project aims at such a method and the present report provides the first results : a practical theory on cognitive determinants of navigation performance , a comparison of navigation support functions with these determinants and the generation three concepts for navigation support : categorising landmarks , history map and navigation assistant . This way we are able to apply cognitive theory and to hook on current NUI developments in the HCI community . Examples of support functions were subsequently developed and implemented using a scenario based design approach ( Carroll , 1995 ) . Specifications of co operative task performances and scenarios proved to be helpful for envisioning and shaping the support functions . The support interface intends to improve navigation in Webenvironments by general and personalised information provision on situation dynamics . The support functions are generic and can be applied to a broad scope of web based services . The three support functions could be easily integrated into two different types of Web sites in terms of concept , since the concepts and design techniques were general enough to allow different implementation solutions . Next to the development and implementation of support concepts , software tools were developed for the assessment of usability in the U WISH project . Currently , the support functions are being evaluated with these tools to establish how much they improve usability , to validate the practical theory on navigation performance , to derive design guidelines for navigation support and to improve the support functions . This should result in a Web based usability handbook for NUIdesigners such as the handbook that was developed for designers of payload interfaces for space laboratories ( Flensholt et al . , 1999 ) . The NUI handbook will structure and refer to current HCI guidelines and techniques using a cognitive engineering framework in which the user interface is specified at two levels . At the task level , based on users’ goals and information needs , the system ’s functions and information provision are specified . At the communication level , the control of the functions and the presentation of the information are specified . The handbook ’s content will provide the guidelines and techniques that apply to navigation performance in particular and the specification of multi modal dialogues for complex or error critical Webservices ( Donk et al . , 1999 ) . This content is enriched with examples .
