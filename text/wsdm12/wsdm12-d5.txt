ABSTRACT Traditionally , research about trust assumes a single type of trust between users . However , trust , as a social concept , inherently has many facets indicating multiple and heterogeneous trust relationships between users . Due to the presence of a large trust network for an online user , it is necessary to discern multi faceted trust as there are naturally experts of different types . Our study in product review sites reveals that people place trust differently to different people . Since the widely used adjacency matrix cannot capture multi faceted trust relationships between users , we propose a novel approach by incorporating these relationships into traditional rating prediction algorithms to reliably estimate their strengths . Our work results in interesting findings such as heterogeneous pairs of reciprocal links . Experimental results on real world data from Epinions and Ciao show that our work of discerning multi faceted trust can be applied to improve the performance of tasks such as rating prediction , facet sensitive ranking , and status theory .

INTRODUCTION
In recent years , the notion of trust has attracted more and more attention from the computer science community [ 6 , 18 ] .
Trust plays a central role in exchanging relationships involving unknown risk [ 4 ] , which provides information about with whom we should share information and from whom we should accept information [ 5 ] . The role of trust is especially critical in some online communities such as e commerce sites and product review sites , which has been described as the “ wild wild west ” of the 21st century [ 19 ] .
Users in product review sites such as Epinions1 can share their reviews about products . Also they can establish their trust networks from which they may seek advice to make decisions . Assuming that users are likely to have similar preferences with their trust networks , trust networks are widely exploited in collaborative filtering [ 8 , 1 ] , intelligent recommender systems [ 17 , 5 ] , review quality prediction [ 15 ] and viral marketing [ 22 ] to improve the accuracy .
Most of these works assume single and homogeneous trust relationships between users . However , trust , as a social concept , has many facets [ 5 ] , indicating multiple and heterogeneous trust relationships between users . People ’s multifaceted interests and experts of different types suggest that people may place trust differently to different people . Siegler et al . pointed out that there is a strong and significant correlation between trust and similarity [ 25 ] . The more similar two people are , the greater the trust between them exists . In the context of product review sites , trust relationships between users can be indicated by their rating similarities [ 1 ] . Figure 1(a ) demonstrates single trust relationships between a real user from Epinions2 , represented by user 1 , and her 20 representative friends . Figures 1(b ) and 1(c ) show their multi faceted trust relationships in the categories of “ Home & Garden ” and “ Restaurants ” , respectively3 . The width of arcs in these figures indicates their trust strengths . The top 3 trustworthy people in Figures 1(a ) , 1(b ) and 1(c ) are users {7 , 8 , 18} , {19 , 8 , 6} and {7 , 9 , 11} , respectively . They are very different from one another , which reveals the existence of multi faceted and heterogeneous trust relationships . For instance , user 7 is the most trustworthy person when assuming a single trust relationship . However , he is not even in the top 3 people in “ Home & Garden ” , in which user 19 is most trustable . We closely examine user 19 from Epinions and find that she is the lead reviewer in “ Home & Garden ” . Thus the user should seek advice from user 19 in “ Home & Garden ” instead of user 7 . Moreover , users

Figure 1 : Single Trust and Multi Faceted Trust Relationships of One User in Epinions might trust some people more than others . For example , Figure 1(b ) and 1(c ) show that their trust strengths vary .
The example from Epinions suggests that single trust can’t capture the real relationships between users . To obtain multi faceted trust relationships between users , there are two challenges : 1 ) how to represent multiple and heterogeneous trust relationships between users ? and 2 ) how to estimate their strengths ? In this paper , we discern multifaceted trust relationships in product review sites to improve data mining related performance . Since an adjacency matrix cannot capture multi faceted trust relationships , a finegrained representation is proposed . By incorporating these relationships into rating prediction , their strengths are estimated . Experiments show that our work can improve the performance in various tasks such as rating prediction , facetsensitive ranking , and status theory . Main contributions of this work include :
• Demonstrating that people with trust relationships have more similar multi faceted interests than those without and show the existence of multi faceted trust relationships in product review sites .
• Proposing a fine gained representation to capture the multi faceted trust relationships between users . By incorporating these relationships into rating prediction , their strengths are estimated .
• Presenting interesting findings from this multi faceted trust study . For example , more than 17 % of transitive trust relationships are heterogeneous , and more than 23 % pairs of reciprocal links are heterogeneous .
• Showing various applications of mTrust such as rating prediction , facet sensitive ranking and status theory and the experiments using real world datasets .
The rest of paper is organized as follows . Section 2 describes the datasets used in our work , discusses multi faceted interests and demonstrates multi faceted trust relationships between users . Section 3 introduces a fine grained representation for multi faceted trust relationships and describes our method to estimate their strengths . Section 4 discusses

2 . DATASETS AND DATA ANALYSIS
For the purpose of this study , we crawled two datasets from two popular product review sites Epinions and Ciao4 in the month of May , 2011 . On both sites , people not only write critical reviews for various products but also read and rate the reviews written by others . Furthermore , people can add members to their trust networks or “ Circle of Trust ” , if they find their reviews consistently interesting and helpful . We started with a set of most active users and then did breadth first search until no new users could be found . For each user , we collected information about profiles , trust networks , and product rating entries . For each product rating entry , we collected date , product name , categories of a product and its ratings . Users with fewer than 5 reviews are pruned . Some statistics of the datasets are shown in Table 1 : Epinions has a much larger trust network while Ciao has more close knit trust relationships , indicated by its higher clustering coefficient and network density .
Both sites employ a 5 star rating system . We investigate their rating distributions and find that more than 70 % ratings are 4 or 5 . Many studies also reported this positive ratings phenomenon in online consumer ratings [ 1 , 7 ] .

High reciprocity is reported in many relationships such as following relationships in Twitter [ 23 ] . We study the reciprocity of trust relationships by showing the correlation between the number of trustors and trustees for each user in Figure 2 . The first observation is that most people have few trustors and trustees , while a few users have an extremely high number of trustees or trustors . We also compute the trustors and trustees for each user and the distributions are shown in Figure 3 . These distributions suggest a power law distribution that is typical in social networks .
( a ) Epinions
( b ) Ciao
Figure 2 : Number of Trustors vs Number of Trustees
Having many trustors does not necessarily mean having many trustees , and vice versa . Some representative users are indicated by red circles in Figure 2 . Our closer examination reveals that the reciprocity is 19.28 % in Epinions and 23.77 % in Ciao .

2.2 Multi Faceted Interests
When people place multi faceted trust to others , they are supposed to have similar multi faceted interests with their trustees . In this section , we investigate the connection between multi faceted interests and trust relationships . More specifically , we want to answer this question : Do people with trust relationships have more similar multi faceted interests than those without ? . To answer this question , we need to define facet in product review sites and how to measure the multi faceted interests similarity between a pair of users .
Facet in product review sites is defined as a set of products which are similar to each other . In product review sites , the notion of category is used to organize products , and products in the same category have similar characteristics . Products are manually assigned to different categories by reviewers . Based on these facts , in our work , categories are regarded as facets . On average , people are interested in 6.3 and 5.8 facets in Epinions and Ciao , respectively .
Let f di(k ) be the probability that user i is interested in facet k , which is formally defined in Eq ( 1 ) f di(k ) = ni(k ) ni
( 1 ) where ni is the total number of products rated by user i and ni(k ) is the number of products from facet k rated by user i . With the facet distribution for each user , multi faceted interests similarity(fdist ) between user i and user j can be measured based on the Jensen Shannon Divergence between two facet distributions f di and f dj . fdist = p2 ∗ DJS(i , j )
= pDKL(f dim ) + DKL(f djm )
( 2 ) where m is the average of the two distributions , ie , m = 1 2 ( f di + f dj ) . DKL is the Kullback Leibler Divergence . For example DKL(f dim ) =P k f di(k ) log f di(k ) m(k )
Figure 3 : Trustors and Trustees Distributions in Epinions and Ciao
We also investigate the correlation between reciprocity and the number of trustors . The results are shown in Figure 4 . We find that people who have fewer trustors are more likely to trust their trustees . It shows that people with many
For each user i , we calculate two fdist , ie , st(i ) and sr(i ) . st(i ) is the average fdist between user i and his/her trust network , while sr(i ) is the average fdist between user i and randomly chosen users , who are not in the trust network of user i . The number of these randomly chosen users is the same as the size of user i ’s trust network .
For a visual comparison , in Figure 5 we plot the Kernelsmoothing density estimations based on the vectors st and

4.13 4.37 4.34 4.41 4.08 4.31 sr . For both datasets , st have smaller concentrated values , ie , smaller fdist , compared with sr .
We also conduct a two sample t test on the vectors st and sr . The null hypothesis is H0 : st = sr , and the alternative hypothesis is H1 : st < sr . For both datasets , the null hypothesis is rejected at significant level α = 0.01 with p value of 3.2e 7 and 1.3e 6 in Epinions and Ciao , respectively .
The evidence from both Figure 5 and t test suggests a positive answer to the question : with high probability , users with trust relationships have smaller fdist than those without . Based on this finding , we further study multi faceted relationships in the next section . 2.3 Multi Faceted Trust Relationships
In order to trust , people need some information usually based on the target person ’s current and previous experiences [ 2 ] . People with similar experiences are more likely to trust each other . In this section , we study rating similarity between users for each facet(facet similarity ) . Due to the strong correlation between user similarity and trust , multifaceted trust relationships between users can be indicated by facet similarities .
We choose six representative facets ( categories ) from Epinions and Ciao to study multi faceted trust relationships . The statistical information for these chosen facets is shown in Table 2 . On average , each product receives more than two ratings . The average ratings for different facets are different and users have different preferences for different facets .
For each user , we calculate the average and the variance of similarities with her/his trust network(trust facet similarity ) and randomly chosen users(random facet similarity ) where n is the number of users . Let ¯sr be the averages of random facet similarities , ¯vt and ¯vr be the averages of their variances , respectively . ¯sr , ¯vt and ¯vr can be obtained similarly as ¯st . Table 3 shows the results in the Epinions dataset and we can get similar results in Ciao .
¯st is always larger than ¯sr . This supports that for each facet , users with trust relationships have more similar product ratings than those without . ¯vt is always larger than ¯vr , indicating that users trust their friends differently and they have greater trust in some friends than in others . The variance of facet similarity directly supports that the strengths of trust relationships vary between users .
Most of the time , the facet similarities are smaller than the overall similarity , while the facet variances are always larger than the overall variance . In other words , for each facet , people only strongly trust a part of their trust networks , or the existence of multi faceted trust between users .
We also want to investigate whether distributions of facet similarities are significantly different . Thus for each pair of facets ( i , j ) , we conduct a two sample Kolmogorov Smirnov(KS ) test on their facet similarity vectors , ie {St( : , i ) , St( : , j)} . The p value is shown in Table 4 . The star next to the pvalue means that there is strong evidence(p < 0.01 ) that two samples come from different distributions .
The table shows that p values for all pairs of facets are close to zero . This implies that the distributions for different facets are significantly different , indicating multi faceted trust relationships in product review sites .
Evidence from Table 3 and KS test suggests the existence of multi faceted relationships between users in product review sites . In the next section , we present our method , mTrust , to model multi faceted relationships , including a fine grained representation and the estimation of their strengths .
3 . MODELING mTrust RELATIONSHIPS
Before building the mathematical model , we would like to establish the notations that are used . Following the standard notations , scalars are denoted by low case letters ( a , b , . . . ) , vectors are written as low case bold letters ( a , b , . . . ) , matri

For example , A(i , j ) is the entry at the ith row and jth column of the matrix A , A(i , : ) is the ith row of A and A( : , j ) is the jth column of A etc . Let u = {u1 , u2 , . . . , un} be the user set vector where n is the number of users . e = {e1 , e2 , . . . , em} and f = {f1 , f2 , . . . , fK} denote the set of products and facets , respectively , where m is the number of products and K is the number of facets . We use A ∈ Rn×n to denote the adjacency matrix for the trust network , in which A(i , j ) = 1 if uj trusts ui and A(i , j ) = 0 otherwise . R ∈ Rn×m denotes the rating matrix and R(i , j ) is the rating for the product ej from ui . PF ∈ Rm×K is the product facet matrix . PF(i , k ) = 1 if ei belongs to fk and PF(i , k ) = 0 , otherwise .
3.1 Tensor Representation for Multi Faceted
Trust Relationships
A trust network is often represented by an adjacency matrix with binary values . Multi faceted trust between users is a quadruple {user , user , facet , strength} , which is out of the scope of what an adjacency matrix can capture . Thus we extend the matrix representation to a tensor representation by adding an extra dimension facets , as demonstrated in Figure 6 .
Figure 6 : Matrix Representation(Left ) vs Tensor Representation(Right )
We first briefly introduce some background on tensors . A tensor , also known as multidimensional matrix [ 3 ] , is a higher order generalization of a vector ( first order tensor ) and a matrix ( second order tensor ) . An N th order tensor A is denoted as A ∈ RI1×I2××IN . A generalization of the product of two matrices is the product of a tensor and a matrix . The mode n product of a tensor A ∈ RI1×I2××IN and a matrix Q ∈ RJn×In is a tensor , denoted as
A ×n Q ∈ RI1××In−1×Jn×In+1IN whose entries are given by
X
( A ×n Q)(i1 , . . . , in−1 , jn , in+1 , . . . , iN ) = A(i1 , . . . , in−1 , in , in+1 , . . . , iN )Q(jn , in )

The proposed representation , as shown in Figure 6 ( Right ) , is a third order tensor . Let A ∈ Rn×n×K represent multifaceted trust relationships among n users in K facets . Each element A(i , j , k ) indicates the strength that uj trusts ui in facet fk . In the next section , we introduce a method to estimate the strengths of multi faceted trust relationships , ie , entities in A . 3.2 Estimation of Strengths of Multi faceted
Trust Relationships
Due to the strong correlation between rating similarity and trust , it is desirable to understand strengths of a user ’s multi faceted trust relations in the context of product rating prediction . The ( u , i ) pairs for which R(u , i ) is known are stored in the set O = {(u , i)|R(u , i ) is known} and unknown pairs are stored in U = {(u , i)|R(u , i ) is unknown} . We denote the predicted value of R(u , i ) as ˆR(u , i ) .
One baseline method for rating prediction is based on users’ preferences and products’ characteristics [ 11 ] . Some users have propensity to give higher ratings than others and some products are more likely to receive higher ratings than others . Thus , the optimization formulation to estimate unknown rating ˆR(u , i ) is shown below , accounting for both user and product effects :
( R(u , i ) − ˆR(u , i))2 + λ( b2(u ) + c2(i ) )
X
X u i
X min b,c
( u,i)∈O
( 6 ) where ˆR(u , i ) = µ + b(u ) + c(i ) . b(u ) and c(i ) indicate the bias of user u and product i respectively . µ is the average rating over all products and λ controls the regularized part to avoid overfitting .
Another baseline method based on trust networks is the nearest neighbor algorithm . Let N ( u , i ) be the set of users who are trusted by user u and have rated product i . Then the unknown rating from u to i can be calculated by :
P
P
R(u , i ) = v∈N ( u,i ) W(v , u)R(v , i ) v∈N ( u,i ) W(v , u )
( 7 ) where W(v , u ) is the strength of single trust from u to v .
We want to incorporate the notion of multiple facets into these two baseline methods . The first baseline method assumes that one user has the same bias to all products . However , from the data analysis section , we know that users might have different bias toward different facets . Also the average ratings for different facets are different . Thus ˆR(u , i ) can be improved by considering facet differences :
ˆR(u , i ) = c(i ) + k PF(i , k)(µ(k ) + B(u , k ) )
( 8 )
P
P k PF(i , k ) where µ(k ) is average rating for fk and B(u , k ) is the bias from u toward fk . nusersnusersnusersnusersKfacets The second baseline method assumes single trust relationships between users . Our tensor representation , ie , multifaceted trust relationships , can be easily incorporated into this method as follows :
P PK P PK v∈N ( u,i ) PF(i , k)A(v , u , k)R(v , i ) v∈N ( u,i ) PF(i , k)A(v , u , k ) k=1 k=1
ˆR(u , i ) =
The first model doesn’t consider the trust network , while the latter one doesn’t consider the bias from products and users . We believe that both factors are useful for rating prediction , thus the rating prediction algorithm to estimate strengths of multi faceted trust are shown below :
“ P P PK PK k=1 k PF(i , k)(µ(k ) + B(u , k ) )
” P P v∈N ( u,i ) PF(i , k)A(v , u , k)R(v , i ) v∈N ( u,i ) PF(i , k)A(v , u , k ) k PF(i , k )
+ c(i ) k=1
+ ( 10 )
ˆR(u , i ) = α
( 1 − α )
In this formulation , the rating u giving to i from fk , ˆR(u , i ) , is determined by two factors . First , the rating is determined by the bias of u toward fk and the characteristics of i . This factor is modeled as the first part of our formulation . Secondly , as mentioned above , users in product review sites always seek advice from their trust networks to make decisions . Thus ˆR(u , i ) should be influenced by the trust network of u . A(v , u , k ) indicates the strength of trust from u to v in fk . If u strongly trusts v in fk , ˆR(u , i ) should be similar to R(v , i ) . The second part of our formulation is used to model this factor , which captures the influence from multi faceted trust relationships between users . The parameter α controls the contributions of these two parts . Note that multi faceted trust relationships can be incorporated into other more complex rating prediction methods , which we leave as our future work .
We define E(u , i ) , p and q as following :
E(u , i ) def= R(u , i ) − ˆR(u , i )

( 11 ) We use projected gradient method to solve Eq ( 11 ) . Then the following rules are used to update {B(u , k ) , c(i),A(v , u , k)} :
B(u , k ) ← B(u , k ) − βB∇B(u,k ) c(i ) ← c(i ) − βc∇c(i )

4 . APPLYING mTrust
In this section , we apply mTrust to improve some data rating prediction , mining tasks on product review sites : facet sensitive ranking , and strengthening status theory . 4.1 Rating Prediction
Users in product review sites are likely to refer to product reviews provided by their trust networks . Thus trust have been widely used to improve the performance of rating prediction [ 16 ] . Most of these approaches assume single trust relationships . However , our work indicates the existence of multi faceted trust relationships between users , which can be used to further improve the performance of prediction .
In section 3.2 , we have already shown how to model multifaceted trust relationships to improve nearest neighbor algorithm . Actually our multi faceted trust relationships can also be incorporated into other complex rating prediction methods , such as latent factor model [ 11 ] as follows :
PK P PK k=1 k=1
P v PF(i , k)A(u , v , k)R(v , i ) v PF(i , k)A(u , v , k )
ˆR(u , i ) = αp u qi+(1−α )
( 14 ) where pu is a user factors vector associated with user u and qi is a product factors vector with product i . α is also used to control the contributions of two factors in Eq ( 14 ) . 4.2 Facet Sensitive Ranking
Ranking nodes in a network is an important problem , and HITS [ 10 ] and PageRank [ 21 ] are two very popular ranking techniques . Most traditional ranking techniques give higher ranks to nodes with better connectivity . However , from the analysis above , people trust others because they have more similar multi faceted interests , which suggests that ranking algorithms in product review sites should consider both trust networks and people ’s interests . Multi faceted trust relationships , which are estimated by taking into account both the link structure and people ’s multi faceted interests , can be used for facet sensitive ranking to improve the performance of ranking . Let FR ∈ Rn×K , each element of which , FR(i , k ) , denotes the ranking of ui in fk . The kth column of FR , FR( : , k ) , represents the rankings of users in fk . Based on the estimated A , FR( : , k ) can be calculated as following :
FR( : , k ) = d × A( : , : , k ) × FR( : , k ) + ( 1 − d ) × e n
( 15 ) where e ∈ Rn = {1 , 1 , . . . , 1} and the parameter d is used to control the probability that a user would ” jump ” to some users instead of following the trust relationships . The overall rankings , fr ∈ Rn , can be obtained from the aggregation of the rankings in different facets . fr = FR × r
( 16 ) where r ∈ RK is a weight vector and r(k ) represents the weight assigned to fk and associated FR( : , k ) .
With the rankings of users in each facet , it is easier for advertisers to differentiate effective users for their products propagation with different facets . 4.3 Strengthening Status Theory
One important social psychological theory is status theory [ 13 ] . In this theory , ui trusting uk means that ui regards uk as having higher status than herself . However , this theory holds weakly on the subset of links in these networks that are reciprocated(consisting of directed links in both directions between two users ) [ 13 ] . For example , if ui trusts uk and uk also trusts ui , as shown in the top subgraph of Figure 7 , then it will be difficult for status theory to determine whose status is higher . heterogeneous transitive and co citation trust relationships are shown in Figure 8 . For example , a transitive trust relationship , i → j → k , is heterogeneous . ui trusts uj in f1 , however , uj trusts uk in f2 ; a cocitation trust , i1 → j2 and i2 → j2 , is heterogeneous . • We study pairs of reciprocal links in the original networks and we find that 23.5 % and 24.1 % pairs of these links are heterogeneous in the Epinions and Ciao , respectively . As shown in the bottom subgraph of Figure 7 , the link i → j and link j → i are different types .
• The original network is a big component for both datasets .
However , we examine the trust relationships in each facet and there exist many components , most of which are singletons . For example , for the first facet in Epinions , 96.7 % of these components are singletons and the biggest component contains 75.5 % users .
Figure 7 : Reciprocity and Status Theory
In the data analysis section , we study reciprocity in trust networks in Epinions and Ciao . The reciprocity is 19.28 % in Epinions and 23.77 % in Ciao . Thus status theory might not hold strongly in both datasets . However , our work indicates that a pair of reciprocal links might be heterogeneous . As shown in the bottom subgraph of Figure 7 , ui trusts uk in facet f1 and uk trusts ui in facet f2 . According to status theory , ui has a higher status in f2 and uk has a higher status in f1 . In this case , status theory holds for this pair of reciprocal links . Thus our work can be applied to strengthening status theory in networks with reciprocal links .
5 . EXPERIMENTS AND FINDINGS
In this section , we describe in detail the findings and different experiments resulting from applying mTrust to the Epinions and Ciao datasets . Two parameters of mTrust , ie , λ and α , are determined through cross validation . 5.1 Findings about mTrust For this experiment , all ratings are used as training data to estimate A , which indicates multi faceted trust relationships between users . We observe the following about A :
• In the studied six facets for both datasets , less than 1 % of users trust their friends in all six facets . However , more than 70 % of users trust their friends more than one facet . On average , people trust only 35.4 % of their trust networks for a specific facet .
• We examine transitive and co citation trust relationships in both datasets . 22.3 % and 17.1 % of transitive trust relationships are heterogeneous for Epinions and Ciao , respectively , while 13.1 % and 11.7 % of cocitation relationships are heterogeneous . Examples of
Figure 8 : Heterogeneous Transitive and Co citation Trust Relationships
5.2 Rating Prediction
The ratings in both datasets are sorted in chronological order and we choose the top 70 % of the datasets as training data and the rest as testing data . Then the model parameters are estimated from past data and to predict f uture data . The estimated parameters , ie , {B , c,A} , can be used to predict unknown ratings . mTrust can be incoporated into other rating prediction methods thus our objective is not to compare rating prediction methods . Instead , we want to verify that considering multi faceted trust relationships between users allows us to improve the performance of prediction . We use a common metric , Root Mean Squared Error(RMSE ) , to evaluate prediction accuracy . sP
RM SE(U ) =
|U| where |U| is the size of testing data U
( u,r)∈U ( R(u , i ) − ˆR(u , i))2
( 17 )
Through cross validation , we set λ = 005 The parameter α controls the contributions of two factors of our formulation . We test different values of α to investigate the importance of these two factors in our study datasets . Results are shown in Figure 9 . The methods mentioned in the figure are defined as follows :
• Mean : the rating of a product is predicted by the mean of known ratings of the product . and people are influenced more by their trust networks . We check the estimated single trust matrix W and find that the strengths of single trust relationships vary between users , ie , people trust some people more than others .
The difference between NN and mNN is that mNN assumes multi faceted trust relationships between users . Comparing the performance of mNN with NN on both datasets , we can see that mNN is always better . The experiments show that mTrust helps capture fine grained relationships between users for better performance .
For both datasets , mTrust obtains the best performance . The algorithm achieves the peak performance with α = 0.3 for Epinions dataset and α = 0.2 for Ciao dataset . A small α means that a higher weight would be put on mNN . This suggests ( 1 ) the importance of trust networks in rating prediction , and ( 2 ) that an appropriate combination of these two factors is crucial to achieve better performance . 5.3 Facet Sensitive Ranking
Facet sensitive ranking , ie , ranking users using multifaceted trust relationships , is one important application of mTrust . For instance , advertisers can easily differentiate effective users for product propagation from different facets . Rankings of users in different facets can also be used for the recommendation of helpful reviews that may be buried in a large number of spam reviews [ 15 ] .
Rankings in facet fk , FR( : , k ) , are calculated by Eq ( 15 ) and the overall rankings , fr , are obtained by Eq ( 16 ) . The weight vector r is set as the probabilities of different facets’ presence , calculated according to the number of rated products from corresponding facets . The multi faceted trust relationships , A , are estimated by all ratings and the damping factor d is set to 085 Due to the limitation of space , we only show the results in Epinions since we get similar results in Ciao . Table 5 lists top 5 users for the studied six facets in Epinions .
We observe that the top ranking people are different for different facets . In other words , people have different rankings in different facets . The ranking results of Epinions for each facet seem reasonable . For example , “ Howard Creech ” is the lead reviewers in “ Electronics ” . His reviews mainly focus on products in “ Electronics ” and most of his reviews are rated as very helpful . “ dlstewart ” is the leader in “ Home & Garden ” . “ popsrocks ” is the leader in “ Hotels & Travel ” and among the top reviewers in “ Restaurants ” . “ Bryan Carey ” is the top 10 people in Epinions . He wrote 3 , 493 reviews about products from various facets such as “ Restaurants ” and “ Hotels & Travel ” . The remaining of the top 5 users are also among the top advisors or top reviewers in their respective facets .
Although “ jo.com ” is the top 1 user in Epinions , she is not even among the top 5 users in some facets such as “ Electronics ” and “ Computer Hardware ” . Facet sensitive ranking for product review effectively take into account both link structure and people ’s multi faceted interests .
It is beyond the scope of this paper to probe further causes of high rankings . However , we observe some commonalities among these top users :
• They usually registered at the sites very early . For example , “ Howard Creech ” was a member of Epinions since Aug 16,1999 and “ yusakugo ” registered Epinions on Apr 14 , 2000 .
( a ) Epinions
( b ) Ciao
Figure 9 : Performance of Rating Prediction in Epinions and Ciao
• UP : the rating of a product is predicted by Eq ( 6 ) and this model assumes that one user has the same bias to all products .
• mUP : the model is a variant of UP , which incorporates the facet differences such as average facet ratings differences and users’ facet bias differences .
• NN : it refers to the nearest neighbor algorithm , as shown in Eq ( 7 ) . NN assumes single trust relationships between users .
• mNN : the rating of a product is predicted by Eq ( 9 ) , which considers multi faceted trust relationships between users .
• mTrust : the rating of a product is predicted by the combination of mUP and mNN , as shown in Eq ( 11 ) .
The first observation is that Mean and UP are very close in performance on both datasets . Most of the time , the majority of users actual ratings are close to the average . As reported in the data analysis section , more than 70 % users give a score of 4 or 5 . When facet differences are incorporated into UP , the performance of mUP is apparently improved . This directly supports the existence of facet differences , ie average facet rating differences and facet bias differences .
The performance of NN is better than that of mUP especially on the Ciao dataset . People on product review sites often refer to the reviews from their trust networks . Thus their product ratings can be easily influenced by their trust networks . Ciao has more close knit trust relationships

5.4 Strengthening Status Theory in Networks with Reciprocal Links
Status theory is one of important social theories about social networks . It is reported in [ 13 ] that the theory of status holds weakly on these networks that are reciprocated . Here we show how mTrust can strengthen status theory in trust networks with reciprocal links .
In status theory , if ui trusts uj , it means that ui regards uj as having higher status than herself . In the context of product review sites , the facet sensitive rankings for users can be considered as their statuses in each facet . if ui trusts uj in fk then uj should have a higher ranking than ui in fk , ie , FR(j , k ) > FR(i , k ) . For this experiment , multi faced trust relationships , A , are estimated by all ratings . Given the trust relationships in fk , A( : , : , k ) , let S be the set of all occurrences of form i → j in A( : , : , k ) . We compute the ratio of trust relationships(RAT ) , on which status theory doesn’t hold as Eq ( 18 ) :
P ( i,j)∈S ϕ(FR(j , k ) − FR(i , k ) )
RAT =
( 18 ) where |S| is the number of trust relationships . ϕ(x ) is a function defined as :
|S|
ϕ(x ) = if x > 0 if x ≤ 0

The RAT and Reciprocity(RCT ) for trust relationships in each facet and original networks in Epinions and Ciao datasets are reported in Table 6 . The reciprocity in trust relationships for each facet is significantly reduced compared to the original trust networks for both datasets . The RAT for each facet is much less than that of the original network . As mentioned above , 23.5 % and 24.1 % pairs of reciprocal links are heterogeneous in Epinions and Ciao , respectively . With the help of mTrust , status theory becomes stronger in the trust networks with reciprocated links .
6 . RELATED WORK
In recent years , the notion of trust has attracted more and more attention from computer science communities . [ 25 , 5 ] investigated the connection between user similarity ( such as ratings of movies ) and trust . They found a strong and significant correlation between trust and similarity . The more similar two people are , the greater the trust between them is .

Guha et al . developed a formal framework of trust propagation schemes [ 6 ] . It first separates trust and distrust matrix and then performs operations on them to obtain the transitive trust between two nodes . In [ 20 ] , the authors propose a method to model and compute the bias or the truthfulness of a user in trust networks . The bias of users are their propensity to trust/distrust other users . They claimed that their model conforms well to other graph ranking algorithms and social theories such as the balance theory . In [ 14 ] , the authors propose a classification approach to predict if a user trusts another user using features derived from his/her interactions with the latter as well as from the interactions with other uses . study how trust and distrust relations among users in social networks can be predicted using various topological features of a social network [ 12 ] .
In addition , Leskovec et al .
Trust network is an important characteristic of product review sites , where users rely on their trust networks to seek advice and make decisions . In [ 16 ] , several methods for incorporating trust networks are proposed to improve the performance of collaborative filtering . Matsuo and Yamamoto study and modeled the bidirectional effects between trust relations and product rating [ 18 ] . Lu et al . propose a generic framework for incorporating social context information to improve review quality prediction [ 15 ] . However , these works assume binary trust relationships between users . Another direction of related research is the prediction of tie strength . Tie strength prediction differs from trust relationship prediction . The former focuses on modeling the strength of existed links rather than link existence . Based on interaction data , a supervised method is proposed in [ 9 ] to distinguish strong ties from weak ties by predicting binary relationship strength between users . Xiang et al . develop a latent variable model to estimate relationship strength from interaction activities and user similarities [ 24 ] . In this model , relationship strength is modeled as the hidden effect of user similarities and it also impacts the nature and frequency of online interactions . Au et al . investigated strength of social influence in trust networks [ 1 ] . It shows that the strength of trust relation correlates with the similarity among the users . A modified matrix factorization technique is used to estimate strengths of trust relations .
This work assumes single and homogeneous trust relationships between users . However , we show that trust inherently has multiple facets and people may place trust differently to different people .
7 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we study multi faceted trust between users in the domain of product review sites . A fine grained approach , mTrust , is proposed to capture multi faceted trust relationships . We apply mTrust to tasks such as rating prediction , facet sensitive ranking , and strengthening status theory . Experiments on two real world datasets show that mTrust effectively capture multi faceted trust and can be applied to improve the performance of rating prediction , facet sensitive ranking , and status theory .
There are new research directions to be investigated . First , mTrust does not consider temporal information related to trust networks and product ratings . When a longer time span is studied ( eg , a year ) , it would be wise to include temporal effects on trust between users . Second , the notion of multi faceted trust may be applicable for other domains , eg , following relationships in Twitter . Finally , sophisticated models can be explored to estimate the strengths of multi faceted trust to advance research and development on trust propagation and trust relationships prediction .
