ABSTRACT It is well known that different types of social ties have essentially different influence between people . However , users in online social networks rarely categorize their contacts into “ family ” , “ colleagues ” , or “ classmates ” . While a bulk of research has focused on inferring particular types of relationships in a specific social network , few publications systematically study the generalization of the problem of inferring social ties over multiple heterogeneous networks . In this work , we develop a framework for classifying the type of social relationships by learning across heterogeneous networks . The framework incorporates social theories into a machine learning model , which effectively improves the accuracy of inferring the type of social relationships in a target network , by borrowing knowledge from a different source network . Our empirical study on five different genres of networks validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework . For example , by leveraging information from a coauthor network with labeled advisor advisee relationships , the proposed framework is able to obtain an F1 score of 90 % ( 8 28 % improvements over alternative methods ) for inferring manager subordinate relationships in an enterprise email network .

INTRODUCTION
Our real social networks are complex and consist of many overlapping parts . Nobody exists merely in one social network . People are connected via different types of social ties in different networks . For example , in an enterprise email network , where people are connected by sending/receiving emails to/from others , the relationships between people can be categorized as manager subordinate , colleague , etc . ; in a mobile communication network , the relationship types could include family , colleagues , and friends . It is well known that the different types of social ties have essentially different influence between people . A graduate ’s research topic may be mainly influenced by his or her advisor , while other parts of his everyday life will be more influenced by their close friends . Awareness of these different types of social relationships can benefit many applications . For example , if we could have extracted friendships between users from a mobile communication network , we can leverage the friendships for a “ word of mouth ” promotion of a new product .
However , in most online networks ( eg , Facebook , Twitter , LinkedIn , YouTube , and Slashdot ) , such information ( relationship type ) is usually unavailable . Users may easily add links to others by clicking “ friend request ” , “ follow ” or “ agree ” , but do not often take the time to create labels and maintain their friend list . Indeed , one survey of mobile phone users in Europe shows that only 16 % of users have created contact groups on their mobile phones [ 10 , 27 ] ; our preliminary statistics on LinkedIn data also shows that more than 70 % of the connections have not been well labeled . A few efforts have been made to infer social ties . For example , Crandall et al . [ 4 ] investigate the problem of inferring friendships between people from co occurrence in time and space . Wang et al . [ 30 ] aim to discover advisor advisee relationships from the publication network . Diehl et al . [ 6 ] try to identify social ties ( eg , managersubordinate ) by learning a ranking function with predefined features . However , most of these works focus on mining particular types of relationships in a specific domain . For example , [ 30 ] defines two heuristic rules as constraints and tries to discover advisoradvisee relationships by propagating the constraints in a graphical model . However , the method is difficult to extend to other domains . Another challenge is that different networks are very unbalanced . In some networks , such as Slashdot , it might be easy to collect some labeled relationships ( eg , trust/distrust relationships between users ) . However , in most other networks , it may be infeasible to obtain the labeled information and thus difficult to accurately infer the social relationships . One potential opportunity is that in the real world , different networks are intertwined with , instead of separated from , each other . Can we leverage the correlations between different networks to help infer the types of social ties ?
Motivating Examples To clearly illustrate the problem , Figure 1 gives an example of inferring social ties across a product reviewers’ network and a mobile communication network . In Figure 1 , the left sub figure is the input to our problem : a reviewer network , which consists of reviewers and relationships between reviewers ; and a mobile network , which is comprised of mobile users and their communication information ( calling or texting message ) .

Figure 1 : Example of inferring social ties across two heterogeneous networks : a reviewer network and a mobile communication network . right sub figure shows the output of our problem : the inferred social ties in the two networks . In the reviewer network , we infer the trust/distrust relationships and in the communication network , we identify friendships , colleagues , and families . The middle of Figure 1 is the component of knowledge transfer for inferring social ties in different networks . This is the key objective of this work . The fundamental challenge is how to bridge the available knowledge from different networks to help infer the different types of social relationships .
The problem is non trivial and poses a set of unique challenges . First , what are the fundamental factors that form the structure of different networks ? Second , how can we design a generalized framework to formalize the problem in a unified way ? Third , as real social networks are getting larger with hundreds of millions of nodes , how to scale up the model learning algorithm to adapt to the growth of large real networks ?
Results In this work , we aim to conduct a systematic investigation of the problem of inferring social ties across heterogeneous networks . We precisely define the problem and propose a transferbased factor graph ( TranFG ) model . The model incorporates social theories into a semi supervised learning framework , which can be used to transfer supervised information from a source network to help infer social ties in a target network .
We evaluate the proposed model on five different genres of networks : Epinions , Slashdot , Mobile , Coauthor , and Enron . We show that the proposed model can significantly improve the performance ( averagely +15 % in terms of F1 Measure ) for inferring social ties across different networks comparing with several alternative methods . Our study also reveals several interesting phenomena for social science :
• Social balance is satisfied well on friendship ( or trust ) networks ; but not ( < 20 % with a large variance ) on user communication networks ( eg , mobile communication network ) . • Users are more likely ( +10% +98 % higher than chance ) to have the same type of relationship with a user who spans a structural hole . Disconnected users have an even higher likelihood .
• It was validated that social status is satisfied in many networks . We further discover that several frequent forms of triads have a similar distribution in different networks ( Coauthor and Enron ) .
• Opinion leaders are more likely ( +71% +84 % ) to have a higher social status than ordinary uses .
Organization Section 2 formulates the problem ; Section 3 introduces the data set and our observations over different networks . Section 4 explains the proposed model and describes the algorithm for learning the model ; Section 5 gives the experimental setup and Section 6 presents the results ; finally , Section 7 discusses related work and Section 8 concludes .
2 . PROBLEM DEFINITION
In this section , we first give several necessary definitions and then present the problem formulation . To simplify the explanation , we frame the problem with two social networks : a source network and a target network , although the generalization of this framework to multiple network setting is straightforward .
Let G = ( V , EL , EU , X ) denote a partially labeled social network , where EL is a set of labeled relationships and EU is a set of unlabeled relationships with EL ∪ EU = E ; X is an |E| × d attribute matrix associated with edges in E with each row corresponding to an edge , each column an attribute , and an element xij denoting the value of the jth attribute of edge ei . The label of edge ei is denoted as yi ∈ Y , where Y is the possible space of the labels ( eg , family , colleague , classmate ) .
Input : The input to our problem consists of two partially labeled networks GS ( source network ) and GT ( target network ) with T | . In other words , the number of labeled relationships |EL in the source network is more larger than that of the target network , with an extreme case of |EL
S | ≫ |EL
T | = 0 .
In real social networks , the relationship could be undirected ( eg , friendships in a mobile network ) or directed ( eg , managersubordinate relationships in an enterprise email network ) . To keep things consistent , we will first introduce the problem in the context of undirected network and then discuss how to extend the proposed framework to the directed ones . In addition , the label of a relationship may be static ( eg , the family member relationship ) or change over time ( eg , the manager subordinate relationship ) . In this work , we focus on static relationships .
Learning Task : Given a source network GS with abundantly labeled relationships and a target network GT with a limited number of labeled relationships , the goal is to learn a predictive function f : ( GT |GS ) → YT for inferring the type of relationships in the target network by leveraging the supervised information ( labeled relationships ) from the source network .
Without loss of generality , we assume that for each possible type yi of relationship ei , the predictive function will output a probability p(yi|ei ) ; thus our task can be viewed as obtaining a triple ( ei , yi , p(yi|ei ) ) to characterize each link ei in the social network . There are several key issues that make our problem formulation different from existing works on social relationship mining [ 4 , 6 , 29 , 30 ] . First , the source network and the target network may be very different , eg , a coauthor network and an email network . What are the fundamental factors that form the structure of the networks ? Second , the label of relationships in the target network and that of the source network could be different . How reliably can we infer the labels of relationships in the target network using the information provided by the source network ? Third , as both the source and the target networks are partially labeled , the learning framework should consider the labeled information as well as the unlabeled information .
3 . DATA AND OBSERVATIONS
3.1 Data Collection
We try to find a number of different types of networks to investigate the problem of inferring social ties across heterogenous networks . In this study , we consider five different types of networks : Epinions , Slashdot , Mobile , Coauthor , and Enron . Table 1 lists statistics of the five networks . All data sets and codes used in this work are publicly available.1
Epinions is a network of product reviewers . Each user on the site can post a review on any product and other users would rate the review with trust or distrust . In this data , we created a network of reviewers connected with trust and distrust relationships . The data set consists of 131,828 nodes ( users ) and 841,372 edges , of which about 85.0 % are trust links . 80,668 users received at least one trust or distrust edge . Our goal on this data set is to infer the trust relationships between users .
Slashdot is a network of friends . Slashdot is a site for sharing technology related news . In 2002 , Slashdot introduced the Slashdot Zoo which allows users to tag each other as “ friends ” ( like ) or “ foes ” ( dislike ) . The data set is comprised of 77,357 users and 516,575 edges of which 76.7 % are “ friend ” relationships . Our goal on this data set is to infer the “ friend ” relationships between users . Mobile is a network of mobile users . The data set is from [ 7 ] . It consists of the logs of calls , blue tooth scanning data and cell tower IDs of 107 users during about ten months . If two users communicated ( making a call or sending a text message ) with each other or co occurred in the same place , we create an edge between them . In total , the data contains 5,436 edges . Our goal is to infer whether two users have a friend relationship . For evaluation , all users are required to complete an online survey , in which 157 pairs of users are labeled as friends of each other .
Coauthor is a network of authors . The data set , crawled from Arnetminer.org [ 28 ] , is comprised of 815,946 authors and 2,792,833 coauthor relationships . In this data set , we attempt to infer advisor advisee relationships between coauthors . For evaluation , we created a smaller ground truth data in the following ways : ( 1 ) collecting the advisor advisee information from the Mathematics Genealogy project2 and the AI Genealogy project3 ; ( 2 ) manually crawling the advisor advisee information from researchers’ homepages . Finally , we have created a data set with 1,534 coauthor relationships , of which 514 are advisor advisee relationships . It consists of 136,329 emails between 151 Enron employees . Two types of relationships , ie , manager subordinate and colleague , were annotated between these employees . The data set was provided by [ 6].Our goal on this data set is to infer manager subordinate relationships between users . There are in total 3,572 edges , of which 133 are manager subordinate relationships .
Enron is an email communication network .
Please note that for the first three data sets ( ie , Epinions , Slashdot , and Mobile ) , our goal is to infer undirected relationships ( friendships or trustful relationships ) ; while for the other two data sets ( ie , Coauthor and Enron ) , our goal is to infer directed relationships ( the source end has a higher social status than the target end , eg , advisor advisee relationships and manager subordinate

As a first step , we engage in some high level investigation of how different factors influence the formation of different social ties in different networks . Generally , if we consider inferring particular social ties in a specific network ( eg , mining advisor advisee relationships from the publication network ) , we can define domainspecific features and learn a predictive model based on some training data . The problem becomes very different , when handling multiple heterogeneous networks , as the defined features in different networks may be significantly different . To solve this problem , we connect our problem to several basic social psychological theories and focus our analysis on the network based correlations via the following statistics :
1 . Social balance [ 8 ] . How is the social balance property satis fied and correlated in different networks ?
2 . Structural hole [ 3 ] . Would structural holes have a similar behavior pattern in different networks ?
3 . Social status [ 5 , 11 , 20 ] . How do different networks satisfy the properties of social status ?
4 . “ Two step flow ” [ 18 ] . How do different networks follow the
“ two step flow ” of information propagation ?
Social Balance Social balance theory suggests that people in a social network tend to form into a balanced network structure . Figure 2 shows such an example to illustrate the structural balance theory over triads , which is the simplest group structure to which balance theory applies . For a triad , the balance theory implies that either all three of these users are friends or only one pair of them are friends . Figure 3 shows the probabilities of balanced triads of the three undirected networks ( Epinions , Slashdot , and Mobile ) . In each network , we compare the probability of balanced triads based on communication links and that based on friendships ( or trust relationships ) . For example , in the Mobile network , the communication links include making a call or sending a message between users . We find it interesting that different networks have very different balance probabilities based on the communication links , eg , the balance probability in the mobile network is nearly 7 times higher than that of the slashdot network , while based on friendships ( or trustful relationships ) the three networks have relatively similar balance probabilities ( with a maximum of +28 % difference ) .

Figure 4 : Structural hole . Probabilities that two connected ( or disconnected ) users ( A and B ) have the same type of relationship with user C , conditioned on whether user C spans a structural hole or not . It is clear that ( 1 ) users are more likely ( averagely +70 % higher than chance ) to have the same type of relationship with C if C spans a structural hole ; and ( 2 ) disconnected users are more likely than connected users to have the same type of relationship with a user who spans a structural hole ( except the mobile network ) .
Structural Hole Roughly speaking , a person is said to span a structural hole in a social network if he or she is linked to people in parts of the network that are otherwise not well connected to one another [ 3 ] . Arguments based on structural holes suggest that there is an informational advantage to have friends in a network who do not know each other . A sales manager with a diverse range of connections can be considered as spanning a structural hole , with a number of potentially weak ties [ 9 ] to individuals in different communities . More generally , we can think about Web sites such as eBay as spanning structural holes , in that they facilitate economic interactions between people who would otherwise not be able to find each other .
Our idea here is to test if a structural hole tends to have the same type of relationship with the other users . We first employ a simple algorithm to identify structural hole users in a network . Following the informal description of structural holes [ 3 ] , for each node , we count the number of pairs of neighbors who are not directly connected . All users are ranked based on the number of pairs and then top 1 % users4 with the highest numbers are viewed as structural holes in the network . Figure 4 shows the probabilities that two users ( A and B ) have the same type of relationship with another user ( say C ) , conditioned on whether user C spans a structural hole

Figure 6 : Social status . Distribution of five most frequent formations of triads with social status . Given a triad ( A , B , C ) , let us use 1 to denote the advisor advisee relationship and 0 colleague relationship . Thus the number 011 to denote A and B are colleagues , B is C ’s advisor and A is C ’s advisor . or not . We have two interesting observations : ( 1 ) users are more likely ( on average +70 % higher than chance ) to have the same type of relationship with C if C spans a structural hole ; ( 2 ) disconnected users are more likely than connected users to have the same type of relationship with a user classified as spanning a structural hole . One exception is the mobile network , where most mobile users in the data set are university students and thus friends frequently communicate with each other .
Social Status Another social psychological theory is the theory of status [ 5 , 11 , 20 ] . This theory is based on the directed relationship network . Suppose each directed relationship labeled by a positive sign “ + ” or a negative sign “ ” ( where sign “ + ” / “ ” denotes the target node has a higher/lower status than the source node ) . Then status theory posits that if , in a triangle on three nodes ( also called triad ) , we take each negative edge , reverse its direction , and flip its sign to positive , then the resulting triangle ( with all positive edge signs ) should be acyclic . Figure 5 illustrates four examples . The first two triangles satisfy the status ordering and the latter two do not satisfy it . We conducted an analysis on the Coauthor and the Enron networks , where we aim to find directed relationships ( advisor advisee and manager subordinate ) . We found nearly 99 % of triads in the two networks satisfy the social status theory , which was also validated in [ 20 ] . We investigate more by looking at the distribution of different forms of triads in the two networks . Specifically , there are in total 16 different forms of triads [ 20 ] . We select five most frequent forms of triads in the two networks . For easy understanding , given a triad ( A , B , C ) , we use 1 to denote the advisor advisee relationship and 0 colleague relationship , and three consecutive numbers 011 to denote A and B are colleagues , B is C ’s advisor and A is C ’s advisor . It is striking that although the two networks ( Coauthor and Enron ) are totally different , they share a similar distribution on the five frequent forms of triads ( as plotted in Figure 6 ) .

Figure 7 : Opinion leader . OL Opinion leader ; OU Ordinary user . Probability that two types of users have a directed relationship ( from higher social status to lower status , ie , manager subordinate relationship in Enron and advisor advisee relationship in Coauthor . It is clear that opinion leaders ( detected by PageRank ) are more likely to have a higher social status than ordinary users .
Opinion Leader The two step flow theory is first introduced in [ 18 ] and further elaborated in literature [ 15 , 14 ] . The theory suggests that ideas ( innovations ) usually flow first to opinion leaders , and then from them to a wider population . In the enterprise email network , for example , managers may act as opinion leaders to help spread information to subordinates .
Our basic idea here is to examine whether “ opinion leaders ” are more likely to have a higher social status ( manager or advisor ) than ordinary users . To do this , we first categorize users into two groups ( opinion leaders and ordinary users ) by PageRank [ 26]5 . With PageRank , we estimate the importance of each user according to the network structure , and then select as opinion leaders with the top 1 % users who have the highest PageRank scores and the rest as ordinary users . Then , we examine the probabilities that two users ( A and B ) have a directed social relationship ( from higher socialstatus user to lower social status user ) such as advisor advisee relationship or manager subordinate relationship . Figure 7 shows some interesting discoveries . First , in both the Enron and Coauthor networks , opinion leaders ( detected by PageRank ) are more likely ( +71% +84 % ) to have a higher social status than ordinary users . Second and also more interestingly , in Enron , it is likely that ordinary users have a higher social status than opinion leaders . Its average likelihood is much larger ( 30 times ) than that in the Coauthor network . The reason might be in the enterprise email network ( Enron ) , some managers may be inactive , and most managementrelated communications were done by their assistants .
Summary According to the statistics above , we have the following intuitions :
1 . Probabilities of balanced triads based on communication links are very different in different networks , while the balance probabilities based on friendships ( or trustful relationships ) are similar with each other .
2 . Users are more likely ( +25% +152 % higher than chance ) to have the same type of relationship with a user who spans a structural hole .
3 . Most triads ( nearly 99 % ) satisfy properties of the social status theory . For the five most frequent formations of triads , the Coauthor and the Enron networks have a similar distribution . 4 . Opinion leaders are more likely ( +71% +84 % higher than chance ) to have a higher social status than ordinary users .

4 . MODEL FRAMEWORK
We propose a transfer based factor graph ( TranFG ) model for learning and predicting the type of social relationships across network . We first describe the model in the context of a single network , and then explain how to transfer the supervised information provided by one network to another network . 4.1 The Predictive Model
Given a network G = ( V , EL , EU , X ) , each relationship ( edge ) ei is associated with an attribute vector xi and a label yi indicates the type of the relationship . Let X = {xi} and Y = {yi} . Then we have the following formulation :
P ( Y |X , G ) =
P ( X , G|Y )P ( Y )
P ( X , G )
( 1 )
Here , G denotes all forms of network information . This probabilistic formulation indicates that labels of edges depend on not only local attributes associated with each edge , but also the structure of the network . According to Bayes’ rule , we have
P ( Y |X , G ) =
P ( X , G|Y )P ( Y )
P ( X , G )
∝ P ( X|Y ) · P ( Y |G )
( 2 ) where P ( Y |G ) represents the probability of labels given the structure of the network and P ( X|Y ) denotes the probability of generating attributes X associated to all edges given their labels Y . We assume that the generative probability of attributes given the label of each edge is conditionally independent , thus we have
P ( Y |X , G ) ∝ P ( Y |G ) Y
P ( xi|yi )
( 3 ) i where P ( xi|yi ) is the probability of generating attributes xi given the label yi . Now , the problem is how to instantiate the probability P ( Y |G ) and P ( xi|yi ) . In principle , they can be instantiated in different ways , for example according to the Bayesian theory or Markov random fields . In this work , we choose the latter . Thus by the Hammersley Clifford theorem [ 12 ] , the two probabilities can be defined as :
P ( xi|yi ) =
P ( Y |G ) =
1 Z1
1 Z2 exp{ d
X j=1
αj gj(xij , yi)} exp{X
X
µkhk(Yc)} c k
( 4 )
( 5 ) where Z1 and Z2 are normalization factors . Eq 4 indicates that we define a feature function gj(xij , yi ) for each attribute xij associated with edge ei and αj is the weight of the jth attribute . It can be defined as either a binary function or a real valued function . For example , for inferring advisor advisee relationships from the publication network , we can define a real valued feature function as the difference of years when authors vi and vj respectively published his first paper . Such a feature definition is often used in Conditional Random Fields [ 17 ] and Maximum Entropy model [ 23 ] . Eq 5 represents that we define a set of correlation feature functions {hk(Yc)}k over each clique Yc in the network . Here µk is the weight of the kth correlation feature function . The simplest clique is an edge , thus a feature function hk(yi , yj ) can be defined as the correlation between two edges ( ei , ej ) , if the two edges share a common end node . We also consider triads as cliques in the TranFG model , in that several social theories we discussed in §3 are based on triads .
If we are given a single network G with labeled information Y , learning the predictive model is to estimate a parameter configuration θ = ( {α} , {µ} ) to maximize the log likelihood objective function O(θ ) = logPθ(Y |X , G ) , ie ,
θ⋆ = arg max O(θ )
( 6 )
4.2 Learning across Heterogeneous Networks We now turn to discuss how to learn the predictive model with two heterogeneous networks ( a source network GS and a target network GT ) . Straightforwardly , we can define two separate objective functions for the two networks . The challenge is then how to bridge the two networks , so that we can transfer the labeled information from the source network to the target network . As the source and target networks may be from arbitrary domains , it is difficult to define correlations between them based on prior knowledge .
To this end , we propose a transfer based factor graph ( TranFG ) model . Our idea is based on the fact that the social theories we discussed in §3 are general over all networks . Intuitively , we can leverage the correlation in the extent to which different networks satisfy the different social theories to transfer the knowledge across networks . In particular , for social balance , we define triad based features to denote the proportion of different balanced triangles in a network ; for structural hole , we define edge correlation based features , ie , correlation between two relationships ei and ej ; for social status , we define features over triads to respectively represent the probabilities of the seven most frequent formations of triads ; for opinion leaders , we define features over each edge .
Finally , by incorporating the social theories into our predictive model , we define the following log likelihood objective function over the source and the target networks :
O(α , β , µ ) = OS ( α , µ ) + OT ( β , µ )
=
|VS | X i=1 + X k d
αj gj ( xS
X j=1 µk( X c∈GS ij , yS i ) +
|VT | X i=1 d′ X j=1
βj g′ j ( xT ij , yT i )
( 7 ) hk(Y S c ) + X c∈GT hk(Y T c ) )
− log Z where d and d′ are numbers of attributes in the source network and the target network respectively . In this objective function , the first term and the second term define the likelihood respectively over the source network and the target network ; while the third term defines the likelihood over all common features defined in the two networks . The common feature functions are defined according to the social theories . Such a definition implies that attributes of the two networks can be entirely different as they are optimized with different parameters {α} and {β} , while the information transferred from the source network to the target network is the importance of common features that are defined according to the social theories . Finally , we define four ( real valued ) balance based features , seven ( real valued ) status based features , four ( binary ) features for opinion leader and six ( real valued ) correlation features for structural hole . More details about feature function are given in Appendix .
Model Learning and Inferring The last issue is how to learn the TranFG model and how to infer the type of unknown relationships in the target network . Learning the TranFG model is to estimate a parameter configuration θ = ( {α} , {β} , {µ} ) to maximize the log likelihood objective function O(α , β , µ ) . We use a gradient
Input : a source network GS , a target network GT , and the learning rate η
Output : estimated parameters θ = ( {α} , {β} , {µ} ) Initialize θ ← 0 ; Perform statistics according to social theories ; Construct social theories based features hk(Yc ) ; repeat

Similar gradients can be derived for parameter αj and βj .
As the graphical structure can be arbitrary and may contain cycles , we use loopy belief propagation ( LBP ) [ 24 ] to approximate the gradients . It is worth noting that to leverage the unlabeled relationships , we need to perform the LBP process twice in each iteration , one time for estimating the marginal distribution of unknown variables yi = ? and the other time for marginal distribution over all cliques . Finally with the gradient , we update each parameter with a learning rate η . The learning algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1 . We see that in the learning process , the algorithm uses an additional loopy belief propagation to infer the label of unknown relationships . After learning , all unknown relationships are assigned with labels that maximize the marginal probabilities .
5 . EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
The proposed framework is very general and can be applied to many different networks . For experiments , we consider five different types of networks : Epinions , Slashdot , Mobile , Coauthor , and Enron . On the first three networks ( Epinions , Slashdot , and Mobile ) , our goal is to infer undirected relationships ( eg , friendships ) , while on the rest two networks ( Coauthor and Enron ) , the goal is to infer directed relationships ( eg , advisor advisee relationships ) .
Comparison Methods We compare the following methods for inferring the type of social relationships .
SVM : similar to the logistic regression model [ 19 ] , SVM uses

PFG : the method is also based on CRF , but it employs the unlabeled data to help learn the predictive model . The method is proposed in [ 29 ] .
TranFG : the proposed approach , which leverages the label information from the source network to help infer the type of relationship in the target network .
We also compare with the method TPFG proposed in [ 30 ] for mining advisor advisee relationships in the publication network . This method is domain specific and thus we only compare with it on the Coauthor network .
In all experiments , we use the same feature definitions for all methods . On the Coauthor network , we do not consider some domain specific correlation features6 .
Evaluation Measures To quantitatively evaluate the performance of inferring the type of social relationships , we conducted experiments with different pairs of ( source and target ) networks , and evaluated the approaches in terms of Precision , Recall and F1 Measure . All codes were implemented in C++ , and all experiments were performed on a PC running Windows 7 with Intel ( R ) Core ( TM ) 2 CPU 6600 ( 2.4GHz and 2.39GHz ) and 4GB memory . The efficiency of the proposed TranFG model is acceptable . For example , it took about five minutes to train a TranFG model over the Epinions and the Slashdot networks .
6 . RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
In this section , we first evaluate the performance of the proposed approach and the comparison methods . Next , we analyze how social theories can help improve the prediction performance . Finally , we give a qualitative case study to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach .

6.1 Performance Analysis
We compare the performance of the four methods for inferring friendships ( or trustful relationships ) on four pairs of networks : Epinions ( S ) to Slashdot ( T ) , Slashdot ( S ) to Epinions ( T ) , Epinions ( S ) to Mobile ( T ) , and Slashdot ( S ) to Mobile ( T).7 In all experiments , we use 40 % of the labeled data in the target network for training and the rest for test . For transfer , we consider the labeled information in the source network . Table 2 lists the performance of the different methods on the four test cases . Our approach shows better performance than the three alternative methods . We conducted sign tests for each result , which shows that all the improvements of our approach TranFG over the three methods are statistically significant ( p ≪ 001 )
Table 3 shows the performance of the four methods for inferring directed relationships ( the source end has a higher social status than the target end ) on two pairs of networks : Coauthor ( S ) to Enron ( T ) and Enron ( S ) to Coauthor ( T ) . We use the same experimental setting as that for inferring friendships on the four pairs of networks , ie , taking 40 % of the labeled data in the target network for training and the rest for test , while for transfer , analogously , we consider the labeled information from the source network . We see that by leveraging the supervised information from the source network , our method clearly improves the performance ( about 15 % by F1 score on Enron and 10 % on Coauthor ) .
The method PFG can be viewed as a non transferable counterpart of our method , which does not consider the labeled information from the source network . From both Table 2 and Table 3 , we can see that with the transferred information , our method can clearly improve the relationship categorization performance . Another phenomenon is that PFG has a better performance than the other two methods ( SVM and CRF ) in most cases . PFG could leverage the unlabeled information in the target network , thus improves the performance . The only exception is the case of Epinions ( S ) to Slashdot ( T ) , where it seems that users in Slashdot have a relatively consistent pattern and merely with some general features such as in degree , out degree , and number of common neighbors , a classification based method ( SVM ) can achieve very high performance .
Factor contribution analysis We now analyze how different social theories ( social balance , social status , structural hole , and two
7We did try to use Mobile as the source network and Slashdot/Epinions as the target network . However as the size of Mobile is much smaller than the other two networks , the performance was considerably worse .

Figure 10 : Performance of inferring directed relationship with and w/o the status based transfer by varying the percent of labeled data in the target network . step flow ( opinion leader ) ) can help infer social ties . For inferring friendships , we consider social balance ( SB ) and structural hole ( SH ) based transfer and for inferring directed friendships , we consider social status ( SS ) and opinion leader ( OL ) based transfer . Here we examine the contribution of the different factors defined in our TranFG model . Figure 8 shows the average F1 Measure score over the different networks , obtained by the TranFG model for inferring friendships and directed relationships . In particular , TranFG SB represents that we remove social balance based transfer features from our model and TranFG All denotes that we remove all the transfer features . It can be clearly observed that the performance drops when ignoring each of the factors . We can also see that for inferring friendships the social balance is a bit more useful than structural hole , and for inferring directed relationships the social status factor is more important than the factor of opinion leader . The analysis also confirms that our method works well ( further improvement is obtained ) when combining different social theories .
Social balance and structural hole based transfer . We present an in depth analysis on how the social balance and structural hole based transfer can help by varying the percent of labeled training data in the target network . We see that in all cases except Slashdotto Epinions , clear improvements can be obtained by using the social balance and structural hole based transfer , when the labeled data in the target network is limited ( ≤ 50% ) . Indeed , in some case such as Epinions to Slashdot , merely with 10 % of the labeled relationships in Slashdot , our method can obtain a good performance ( 88 % by F1 score ) . Without transfer , the best performance is only 70 % ( obtained by SVM ) . We also find that structural balance based transfer is more helpful than structural hold based transfer for inferring friendships in most cases with various percents of labeled relationships . This result is consistent with that obtained in the factor contribution analysis .
A different phenomenon is found in the case of Slashdot toEpinions , where all methods can obtain a F1 score of 94 % with only 10 % of the labeled data . The knowledge transfer seems not helpful . By a careful investigation , we found simply with those features ( Cf . Appendix for details ) defined on the edges , we could achieve a high performance ( about 90% ) . The structure information indeed helps , but the gained improvement is limited .
Social status and opinion leader based transfer . Figure 10 shows an analysis for inferring directed relationships on the two cases ( Enron to Coauthor and Coauthor to Enron ) . Here , we focus on testing how social status and opinion leader based transfer can help infer the type of relationships by varying the percent of labeled relationships in the target network . In both cases ( Coauthorto Enron and Enron to Coauthor ) , the TranFG model achieves consistent improvements . For example , when there is only 10 % of labeled advisor advisee relationships in the Coauthor network , without considering the status and opinion leader based transfer , the F1 score is only 24 % . By leveraging the status and opinion leader based transfer from the email network ( Enron ) , the score is doubled ( 47% ) . Moreover , we find that the social status based transfer is more helpful than the opinion leader based transfer with various percents of the labeled data .
6.2 Case Study
Now we present a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model . Figure 11 shows an example generated from our experiments . It represents a portion of the Coauthor network . Black edges and arrows respectively denote labeled colleague relationships and advisor advisee relationships in the training data . Colored arrows and edges indicate advisor advisee and colleagues relationships detected by three methods : SVM , PFG and TranFG , with red color indicating mistake ones . The numbers associated with each author respectively denote the number of papers and the score of h index .
We investigate more by looking at a specific example . SVM mistakenly classifies three advisor advisee relationship and two col fl

Red colored edges indicates wrong predictions . league relationships . SVM trains a local classification model without considering the network information . PFG considers the network information as well as the unlabeled data , thus obtains a better result . Our proposed TranFG model further corrects two mistakes ( “ Fait Leonardi ” and “ Ausiello Laura ” ) by leveraging properties of social status and opinion leader . For example , the results obtained by PFG among “ Azar ” , “ Amos ” and “ Leonardi ” form a triad of ( “ 011 ” ) . Although it satisfies the property of social status , the probability of such triad is much lower ( 0.4 % vs . 24.6 % ) than the form ( “ 100 ” ) . However , the limitation of the training data leads PFG to result in a bias mistake ( 5.8 % vs . 126 % ) TranFG smoothes the inferring results by transferring knowledge from the source ( Enron ) network .
7 . RELATED WORK
Inferring social ties is an important problem in social network analysis . Liben Nowell et al . [ 21 ] present a unsupervised method for link prediction . Xiang et al . [ 33 ] develop a latent variable model to estimate relationship strength from interaction activity and user similarity . Backstrom et al . [ 2 ] propose a supervised random walk algorithm to estimate the strength of social links . Leskovec et al . [ 19 ] employ a logistic regression model to predict positive and negative links in online social networks . Hopcroft et al . [ 13 ] study the extent to which the formation of a reciprocal relationship can be predicted in a dynamic network . However , most existing works focus on predicting and recommending unknown links in social networks , but ignore the type of relationships .
Recently , there are several works on inferring the meanings of social relationships . Diehl et al . [ 6 ] try to identify the managersubordinate relationships by learning a ranking function . Wang et al . [ 30 ] propose an unsupervised probabilistic model for mining the advisor advisee relationships from the publication network . Crandall et al . [ 4 ] investigate the problem of inferring friendship between people from co occurrence in time and space . Eagle et al . [ 7 ] present several patterns discovered in mobile phone data , and try to use these patterns to infer the friendship network . However , these algorithms mainly focus on a specific domain , while our model is general and can be applied to different domains . More importantly , our work takes the first step to incorporate social theories for inferring social ties across heterogeneous networks .
Our work is related with link prediction , which is one of the core tasks in social networks . Existing work on link prediction can be broadly grouped into two categories based on the learning methods employed : unsupervised link prediction and supervised link prediction . Unsupervised link predictions usually assign scores to potential links based on the intuition the more similar the pair of users are , the more likely they are linked . Various similarity measures of users are considered , such as the Adamic and Adar measure [ 1 ] , the preferential attachment [ 25 ] , and the Katz measure [ 16 ] . A survey of unsupervised link prediction can be found in [ 21 ] . Recently , [ 22 ] designs a flow based method for link prediction . There are also a few works which employ supervised approaches to predict links in social networks , such as [ 31 , 2 , 19 ] . The main difference between existing work on link prediction and our effort lies in that existing work mainly focuses on specific domains , while our proposed model combines social theories ( such as structural balance , structural hole , and social status ) into a transfer learning framework and can be easily applied to different domains .
8 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we study the novel problem of inferring social ties across heterogeneous networks . We precisely define the problem and propose a transfer based factor graph ( TranFG ) model . The model incorporates social theories into a semi supervised learning framework , which is used to transfer supervised information from the source network to help infer social ties in the target network . We evaluate the proposed model on five different genres of networks . We show that the proposed model can significantly improve the performance for inferring social ties across different networks comparing with several alternative methods . Our study also reveals several interesting phenomena .
The general problem of inferring social ties represents a new and interesting research direction in social network analysis . There are many potential future directions of this work . First , some other social theories can be further explored and validated for analyzing the formation of different types of social relationships . Next , it is also interesting to study how to further correct the inferring mistakes by involving users into the learning process ( eg , via active learning ) . Another potential issue is to validate the proposed model on some other social networks .

Appendix There are two categories of features . The first category includes local features defined for each specific network , and the second includes transfer features defined based on the social theories . Tables 4 7 give a summary of local feature definitions for the five networks . For a more detailed description of the feature definitions , please refer to literature [ 6 , 7 , 19 , 29 ] .
For the transfer features , in Epinions , Slashdot and Mobile , we define four ( real valued ) balance triad based features and six ( realvalued ) structural hole based features . In the Coauthor and Enron , we define seven ( real valued ) social status based features and four ( binary ) opinion leader based features .
