ABSTRACT Word of mouth has proven an effective strategy for promoting products through social relations . Particularly , existing studies have convincingly demonstrated that word ofmouth recommendations can boost users’ prior expectation and hence encourage them to adopt a certain innovation , such as buying a book or watching a movie . However , less attention has been paid to studying the posterior effect of word of mouth recommendations , ie , whether or not wordof mouth recommendations can influence users’ posterior evaluation on the products or services recommended to them , the answer to which is critical to estimating user satisfaction when proposing a word of mouth marketing strategy . In order to fill this gap , in this paper we empirically study the above issue and verify that word of mouth recommendations are strongly associated with users’ posterior evaluation . Through elaborately designed statistical hypothesis tests we prove the causality that word of mouth recommendations directly prompt the posterior evaluation of receivers . Finally , we propose a method for investigating users’ social influence , namely , their ability to affect followers’ posterior evaluation via word of mouth recommendations , by examining the number of their followers and their sensitivity of discovering good items . The experimental results on real datasets show that our method can successfully identify 78 % influential friends with strong social influence .

INTRODUCTION
Word of mouth recommendation , the process that an individual passes personal attitude to another ( eg , encouraging a potential customer to buy a product ) , has proven in decades to be an effective way to influence the latter ’s decision making . It was found that , for example , in the shopping site Amazon1 an increase in book reviews , which is a kind of online word of mouth recommendations , results in an increase in relative sales [ 7 ] . Consequently , word ofmouth marketing has been quickly developing via a variety of media including messages , blogs , microblogs and emails . In recent years , the integration of social network services and online sharing communities has gained a great success on a large number of web sites , such as Douban2 and Goodreads3 , where millions of users cannot only rate books , music and movies , but also share their ratings and reviews with friends or followers . On those social network sites , the phenomenon that users recommend favorites to friends and followers plays an important role in shaping users’ behaviors and their collections . Therefore , a deep understanding of word of mouth recommendations could be a key to designing a successful marketing strategy in online sharing communities . 1wwwAmazoncom 2wwwDoubancom 3wwwGoodreadscom
The pervasive usage of word of mouth leads to a highly interesting research topic to understand its intrinsics . In decades various models , such as linear threshold , cascade model and spreading model , have been developed to explain why and how a word of mouth message encourages a receiver to adopt a certain innovation ( eg , a new product ) . It is widely believed that the reason encouraging a receiver to adopt an innovation is that a word of mouth message can raise his/her prior expectation on the concerned innovation , ie , how valuable , useful and usable he/she expects the product to be . For example , when facing the question “ to buy a BluRay player or an HD DVD player ” , a person would more likely choose the former if many of his/her friends have already possessed BluRay players , which often provides a strong evidence in the quality of BluRay players .
However , less attention has been paid to investigating the posterior effect of word of mouth recommendations on a user ’s posterior evaluation , ie , whether or not a wordof mouth recommendation influences the evaluation ( eg , a rating ) of the user on a product after he/she actually buys and experiences it . Without such knowledge , it is almost impossible to estimate user satisfaction , which is strongly related to user loyalty , before a word of mouth marketing strategy is proposed .
Intuitively , posterior evaluation depends only on how a product matches users’ need , and is unlikely related to whether or not a friend has recommended it before . Nonetheless , in this paper we find a counter intuitive phenomenon that a word of mouth recommendation surprisingly causes a change in the posterior evaluation of users . Upon this finding , we propose a framework to quantitatively measure social influence , ie , the ability of an individual to affect a certain follower ’s posterior evaluation , and further develop a method for identifying individuals with great social influence . By properly estimating individuals’ social influence , it is possible to leverage word of mouth recommendations in social networks to improve user satisfaction . In general , the main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :
1 . This paper studies the relationship between word ofmouth recommendations and users’ posterior evaluation and find a counter intuitive phenomenon that word of mouth recommendations are correlated to a raise in users’ posterior evaluation .
2 . Through elaborately designed hypothesis tests , we prove , for the first time , that word of mouth recommendations can significantly prompt users’ posterior evaluation .
3 . We propose a framework to quantitatively measure individuals’ social influence by examining the number of their followers and their sensitivity of discovering good items .
4 . We develop a method for identifying influential friends with strong social influence . Upon experiments on real datasets , we demonstrate that our method can identify up to 78 % influential friends .
The rest sections are organized as follows : Section 2 summarizes existing studies on word of mouth recommendations . Section 3 describes how we find the phenomenon that word of mouth recommendations are correlated to a raise in users’ posterior evaluation . Section 4 proposes two hypotheses to the reason that causes the phenomenon . The hypotheses are further tested in Section 5 . In Section 6 we demonstrate that an influential individual can be identified with his/her sensitivity on good items and the number of followers .
2 . RELATED WORKS
There is a long history of research focusing on the phenomenon , mechanics and usage of word of mouth recommendations . Earlier research observed the phenomenon that a word of mouth can effectively affect the receiver ’s decision making [ 16 ] . Consequently , word of mouth marketing , the strategy for promoting products with word of mouth recommendations , has been rapidly developing to encourage purchase by increasing a potential customer ’s prior expectation on the concerned product . The media of word of mouth recommendation is not limited to traditional oral conversation , but extended to online book reviews [ 7 ] , emails [ 20 ] , blogs [ 1 ] , tweets [ 4 ] , etc .
The wide usage of word of mouth has attracted great research attention to explain its intrinsic mechanics , which becomes practically possible with the availability of tremendous data from modern online communities [ 11 ] . Richardson and Domingos modeled the network value of individuals in social network when a word of mouth marketing is proposed [ 12 , 24 ] . Lescovec empirically analyzed email promotions in a person to person network and figured out how purchase probability increases with incoming recommendations from friends [ 20 ] . Various models have been developed to explain the mechanism how a word of mouth message encourages a receiver to adopt a certain innovation , such as linear threshold [ 15 ] , cascade model [ 13 ] and spreading model [ 23 , 31 , 8 ] .
So far , lots of existing studies have been focusing on quantitatively estimating social influence of single nodes in social networks with topological and behavioral methods [ 26 ] . In many papers , it is believed that influence is related with the topological roles of the nodes in social networks , and can thus be calculated by link analysis , such as PageRank , HITS and LeaderRank [ 22 ] . More other studies attempted to estimate social influence by mining user behavior history to examine the effect of an individual on another ’s prior expectation and further decision making in a variety of scenarios , such as blogs [ 1 ] , tweets [ 4 ] , tags [ 14 ] , books [ 17 ] and product reviews [ 3 ] . In addition , researchers have found that social influence could vary across different topics and items . Romero et al . found that tags of different types and topics spread in different mechanics on Twitter [ 25 ] , Song and Tang found social influence can be of different strengths and directions given different topics [ 28 , 29 ] , and Cui et al . calculated social influence on item level granularity with a modified matrix factorization algorithm [ 10 ] .
Other research results focus on influence maximization , the task to find a small set of seed nodes to trigger a viral marketing that can reach a maximal range of nodes on an underlying social network , given the way information flows ( eg , defining the successful rate to propagate an innovation through every edge ) . Such a set of influential individuals are preferred when a merchant proposes a viral marketing . Many solutions have been developed to iteratively select seeds with a greedy algorithm , which guarantees a near optimal selection , such as Kempe et al . et al . [ 21 ] .
[ 19 ] and Leskovec
Researchers also paid attention to discover influence hidden behind the correlation between a user ’s actions and his friends’ behaviors . However , it is difficult to tell whether the correlation comes from influence or homophily , since the discovery of causality relation between variables is always a hard job and requires careful experimental design [ 18 ] . Crandall pointed out that influence and similarity can interplay [ 9 ] . Anagnostopoulos excluded influence with a high probability through an empirical analysis on the photo tagging website Flickr [ 2 ] .
Sociologist analyzed the motive that why an individual sends a word of mouth recommendation in social networks . Many hints revealed that whether or not a word of mouth recommendation is presented mostly depends on the degree a recommender himself perceives the valuable , usefulness and usability of the referred product [ 6 ] . Wasko found reasons to share opinions also include reputation building or enjoyable feeling [ 30 ] . Those findings help us simplify our model in Section 51
Although extensive studies have focused on addressing the prior expectation of word of mouth recommendations , less attention has been paid to investigating how word of mouth recommendations affect users’ posterior evaluation . Bone found that a word of mouth comment from authority could bias users’ post usage performance judgments [ 5 ] , ie , users’ posterior evaluation . However , a more common question , ie , whether or not an ordinary user ’s word of mouth recommendation can affect his/her friends’ posterior evaluation , is still unclear . We intend to answer it in this study .
3 . PRELIMINARY STUDY
In this section , we demonstrate the counter intuitive phenomenon that word of mouth recommendations can cause significant posterior effect on users . More specifically , wordof mouth recommendations can obviously prompt users’ posterior evaluation . 3.1 Data collection
We collect data from the aforementioned two online communities , Douban and Goodreads , where users can rate books and movies , and follow or make friends with other users . Friends are treated as mutual followers . The collected data contain user activities before Aug 2010 when we crawled the two web sites . We started crawling from the member lists of several hottest discussion groups on those web sites , and iteratively expanded to users who follow , or are followed by , the crawled ones . Among the 1 , 014 , 890 Douban users and 912 , 973 Goodreads users crawled , we remove inactive users who have rated less than 5 items and followed less than 5 other users , since their inactivity may lead to unreliable statistics . The detailed information about the datasets are presented in Table 1 . In both datasets , the distribution of item popularity ( how many times an item is collected ) is observed in a power law as shown in Fig 1 .
On Douban , a user clicks the “ recommend ” button on an item ’s page to recommend it . Afterwards , all followers will get a notification of the recommendation . A total of 165 , 905(15.2 % ) Douban items are recommended by at least one user , as shown in Fig 2 . On Goodreads , when a user rates a book , all followers will get a recommendation message like “ Adam loves Harry Potter 7 ” . If a user rates an

In order to make ratings from different users comparable , we transform all ratings into Z scores as follows , which will be used in the remained sections if no further specification is given . ru,i =

( 1 )
Ru,i − ¯Ru
σu where ru,i is the Z score , corresponding to Ru,i that is the observed rating user u posted on item i ; ¯Ru and σu are the mean and deviation among all ratings posted by user u , respectively . 3.2 Higher ratings on items with recommen dations
Firstly , we take a glance at the ratings of two sample movies The Pursuit of Happyness and Lost in Translation on Douban . The former movie has been rated by over 200 , 000 users with a mean rating of 4.2 out of 5 stars , ranked top 30 % , whilst the latter gets a relatively low mean rating of 3.9 , ranked top 50 % . Fig 3 shows the rating distributions of these two movies and Table 2 reports ratings from 7 users who have rated both movies , where ratings with word ofmouth recommendation are underlined . An obvious trend can be revealed that with word of mouth recommendations Douban users are more likely to present a higher rating to the recommended movies , indicating that they enjoy recommended movies more than unrecommended ones . This trend is even clearer on the lower rated movie Lost in Translation . Specifically , the probability to rate it with 5 stars increases to 4 times if a recommendation is present .
To examine whether or not the above observed trend reflects a general tendency , we report the probability distributions of all ( normalized ) ratings with and without word ofmouth recommendations on the two collected datasets . As

Figure 3 : The probability distributions of Douban user ratings of a high rated movie The Pursuit of Happyness ( left ) and a low rated movie Lost in Translation ( right ) . shown in Fig 4 , an individual is more likely to present a high rating ( less likely a low rating ) to an item with a wordof mouth recommendation , compared with an item without . Besides , the mean ratings without recommendations are almost zero in both Fig 4(a ) and 4(b ) , which is straightforward given the way we normalize ratings . In contrast , the mean ratings with recommendations are raised by 0.176 and 0.081 in two datasets respectively . Upon such observations , we can assert that as compared with an item without a word of mouth recommendation , an item recommended by a friend is tended to be given a higher rating , implying that a word of mouth recommendation is correlated to a raise in user posterior evaluation .
An obvious explanation is that a recommendation implies the high quality of an item , which straightforwardly leads to a higher rating . Fig 5(a ) reveals that an item recommended at least once has a much larger collection count ( solid curve ) than than an item without any recommendation ( dash curve ) , and the collection count of an item is strongly related to its recommendation count . Furthermore , the mean rating of items with at least one recommendation ( solid curve and dash curve ) is higher than that of items without recommendations ( dash dot curve ) , as is shown in Fig 5(b ) , although the ratings seem not correlated to the recommendation counts .
However , the above explanation only considers whether or not an item is recommended and ignores a possibly key factor that who recommends it . Therefore , in the following we examine the difference between the rating of an item recommended by the rater ’s friends , and that of an item recommended by a stranger that the rater never knows . Fig 5(b ) shows that a rating of an item with a word of mouth recommendation ( solid curve ) is even higher than that of an

In a word , the tendency should not be simply explained with “ a recommended item is preferred ” , since word of mouth recommendations play an indispensable role in influencing user ratings .
4 . POSTERIOR EVALUATION MODELS
In this section we propose two possible models in order to formally explain the phenomenon observed in the previous section , whose validity and effectiveness will be further tested in the next section .
In the first model , a word of mouth recommendation and a higher rating of an item both attribute to certain common but unknown factors . In the other model , a word of mouth recommendation directly influences the rater to present a higher rating . The key difference between these two models lie in whether or not there is a causality relation between a word of mouth recommendation and an increase of the average user rating of an item .
The first model , which can be easily thought of , indicates that an individual ’s higher rating and his/her friend ’s rec

Figure 5 : The popularity and ratings wrt recommendation count of items on Douban . ommendation are both results of a group of unknown factors , including item quality , shared interests and any other reason . Take item quality for example . A recommendation can be viewed as a strong hint regarding the quality of the recommended item . If an item is recommended , it is more probable that the item is good enough to worth a higher rating . Another example is shared interests . It is observed in social networks that friends often share common interests more or less . If a friend of a user loves a movie and thus recommends it , it is quite probable that the movie also matches the user ’s taste , and thus a higher rating can be expected . Without loss of generality , we abstract such a model in Fig 6(a ) , where a single variable c denotes a combination of all common factors . In this model , an individual ’s higher rating , denoted as r , and whether his/her friend recommends , denoted as m . , are independent results from common unknown factors . Later on , we refer to this model as the independent model .
The second explanation which sounds more consequential is that a friend ’s word of mouth recommendation is a direct cause of an individual ’s higher rating : m . directly influences r , as shown in Fig 6(b).4 For instance , the existence of a word of mouth recommendation may bring extra benefit to the receiver ( eg , reading a book that a friend recommends

Throughout the paper , this model is referred to as the influential model . Note that we do not assume that a word of mouth recommendation is the only factor of user posterior evaluation .
5 . MODEL VERIFICATION
In this section , we examine which of the two aforementioned models is supported by the real data using statistical hypothesis tests . 5.1 Designing statistical hypothesis tests
According to Fig 6(a ) and Fig 6(b ) , in order to judge which model is more appropriate to explain the real data , we need to examine the conditional independence between m . and r given c . Unfortunately , such a conditional independence cannot be directly examined since the hidden variable c is unobservable . To circumvent this problem , we introduce the recommender ’s rating , denoted as r . , to modify the models . In some cases an individual u rates an item previously = 1 ) , r . recommended by his friend ( ie , m . denotes the rating that the friend posted to the item . In other cases an individual u rates an item with no friend recommendation ( ie , m . denotes the rating posted to the item by a randomly chosen friend of u who might have recommended the item to u . The modified independent model is shown in Fig 6(c ) . Such a modification is reasonable from two aspects : 1 ) r . depends on c symmetrically as r in the original independent model ; 2 ) m . due to a common practice that whether or not a user recommends an item is determined by his/her rating on this item [ 6 , 30 ] . In the modified independent model , whether m . and r are independent conditioned on r . is equivalent with whether they are independent conditioned on c , according to Bayesian net fully depends on r .

)
.
) . Since m . and r given r . work property . In addition , for the influential model where m . is a direct factor node of r , the dependence of r on m . always hold no matter any other variables are observed , as shown in Fig 6(d ) . Therefore , we can judge which of the independent model and the influential model is more appropriate by examining the conditional independence between and r given r . m . Now we design a statistical hypothesis test to examine the conditional independence between m . . In our test , each data point is a triple m , r , rfi We first divide the observed data points into distinct partitions such that the data points in each partition share a unique or similar r . value and therefore follow , and can well approximate , the conditional probability distribution p(m . , r|r . ) if the partition size is large enough for convergence . For this purpose , we discretize the real valued r . into distinct values in two ways , namely , equal interval partitioning or equal frequency partitioning . For the equal interval partitioning , the values of r . in each partition are confined within a fixed small interval . We discard partitions containing less than 100 data points due to their low statistical reliability . For the equalfrequencies partitioning , each partition has a fixed number of data points . We ignore partitions where the interval of r . is too large ( greater than 0.05 ) to guarantee the values of r . in the same partition are close enough.5 For each partition , we test the independence between p(m|r and p(r|r . can take only two values , namely , 0 and 1 , p(m|r ) if and only if p(r|m . = 1 , r . = 0 , r . ) for any given r . ) is identical to p(r|m . ) can be examined by testing the empirical measure of two samples , {r|m . = 1 , r.} , which serve as good estimators when the sample size is large enough . Specifically , we employ two different statistical hypothesis test methods to examine : the location t test to examine whether there exists a significant difference between the means of the two samples , and the Kolmogorov Smirnov test to examine whether there exists a significant difference between the empirical distribution functions of the two samples . The null hypothesis in our test is that there exists no statistically significant difference between p(r|m . ) and p(r|m . . If the null hypothesis holds , it implies that given a certain value of r . , r identically distributes , regardless of the values of m . and therefore the independent model is supported . On contrary , the alternative hypothesis that the two samples are significantly different disproves the conditional independence and supports the influential model . We test the null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance level against the alternative hypothesis in all partitions for a consistent conclusion . We will declare the influential model holds if tests in almost all partitions reject the null hypothesis , and vice versa . In practice we report the reject ratio as a final result , ie the percentage of partitions where statistical hypothesis tests reject the null hypothesis .

In summary , the statistical hypothesis test is conducted as follows : 5The discretization of recommender rating r . is valid . Our normalization preprocess from integer ratings to real number Z scores guarantees that the Z score space of the whole dataset is still countable . Therefore , discretizing Z scores does not greatly violate value dependence .

5.2 Results of statistical hypothesis tests In our test , we only consider the ratings falling into the range [ −3 , 3 ] that accounts for most of the ratings from the Douban and Goodreads datasets . As a consequence , we obtain 186 , 054 data points with m . = 1 and 2 , 278 , 023 with m . = 0 for the Douban dataset . For Goodreads , the numbers of the data points are 6 , 759 , 850 and 2 , 899 , 793 , respectively .
Fig 7 illustrates the test result . When we divide Goodread s dataset into partitions with a fixed size of 20 , 000 data points , the Kolmogorov Smirnov test rejects the null hypothesis in 461(98.5 % ) partitions among 468 ones , and the t test rejects in 97.2 % of all partitions . Similarly , when the Goodreads dataset is divided into partitions with an equal interval of 0.03 , which results in an average size of around 48 , 000 data points in each partition as shown on the axis label , the Kolmogorov Smirnov test rejects the null hypothesis in 155 partitions among 185 ones , covering 83.8 % partitions and 97.5 % data points , while the t test rejects in 152(82.2 % ) partitions and 97.5 % data points .
Test results are obvious positive , reading that on both datasets and with both partitioning ways , the two adopted statistical hypothesis tests consistently reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis in a majority of partitions . The percentage of partitions where the null hypothesis is rejected increases with the number of data points contained in each partition , because larger samples can better establish a reliable result . When the partition size is large enough , the tests on almost all partitions consistently reject the null hypothesis , strongly supporting the influential model .
The fact that tests on Douban dataset fail to reject the null hypothesis in all partitions might attribute to the imbalance and size of Douban dataset . The Douban dataset is much more imbalanced than the Goodreads dataset , given less than 14 % data points are observed with m . = 1 . Besides , the number of Douban data points tested is less than one fourth of that of Goodreads dataset , therefore it is reluctant to afford a large amount of large partitions to establish reliable statistics results . With the obvious trend that a higher reject ratio comes with a larger size of partition , tests on Douban is expected to reach a almost hundred percent reject ratio with a larger dataset .
In summary , the two sample tests in most partitions reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis that r behaves differently with different m . is observed , which suggests that the influential model correctly captures the causality relation hidden in the real data . That is to say , the posterior evaluation of a user directly depends on whether or not a friend has previously recommended the concerning item to him/her . values even when r .
6 . IDENTIFYING INFLUENTIAL FRIENDS In the previous section , we have shown that word of mouth recommendations can influence users’ posterior evaluation on the items they have experienced , which are specifically reflected by the increase of ratings presented by the receivers of the recommendations . Now it is of high interest to know what kind of persons are influential via their word of mouth recommendations and to identify the influential friends for each user . 6.1 Social influence measurement
Before proceeding , we need to quantify the raise in posterior evaluation brought by each word of mouth recommendation . We use U− u,i to denote the rating on the item i from the user u without recommendations from his friends and U + u,i to denote the rating with recommendations . Then the raise caused by word of mouth recommendation can be calculated by xu,i = U + u,i
− U− u,i
. u,i and U−
( 2 )
Unfortunately , we cannot observe U + u,i simultaneously . To address this problem , we consider only the cases where U + u,i can be observed , ie , the user u rated the item i after the item has been recommended by his/her friends at least once6 . For the unobserved U− u,i , we estimate its value with ˆru,i , the expected rating a user would have posted without recommendations from his friends . In practice , ˆru,i can be calculated with well studied collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms . Actually , any recommendation algorithm can be used with the only constraint
6For ease of identifying the influential source , in practice we ignore ratings posted with two or more friend recommendations , which are only a small portion of our observations . fu,v =

. i∈Iuv ˆxv,i |Iuv| that the used algorithm should not leverage the knowledge about the friendships . In this paper , we employ the probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm [ 27 ] , which has proven an effective and accurate algorithm especially for the sparse cases . For the sake of convenience , we also replace the U + u,i with ru,i and the raise in posterior evaluation caused by word of mouth recommendation can be written as
ˆxu,i = ru,i − ˆru,i .
( 3 )
For the probabilistic matrix factorization algorithm , we train it with the training set consisting of only the ratings posted without recommendations . In this way , the trained model estimate the unobserved ratings ˆru,i without the knowledge about friendships . Under such consideration , the two training datasets obtained for Douban and Goodreads contain 23 , 417 , 433 and 16 , 698 , 014 ratings , respectively . With the trained model , we estimate ˆru,i for each observed ru,i and calculate the raise in posterior evaluation caused by word of mouth recommendations using Eq ( 3 ) . Then , for any edge ( u , v ) which represents the friendship between two users u and v in the friendship network , we can measure the influence of u on v as the average raise in posterior evaluation over all items Iuv recommended to v by u and rated by v after the recommendation . Specifically , the social influence of u on v is calculated as where |Iuv| denotes the number of items in Iuv .
Given social influence calculated on all edges , salient asymmetry is observed that there usually exists an individual , between a pair of mutually connected friends , having a much greater social influence upon the other than what the other has on him . We quantify this phenomenon with the ratio of social influence on each pair of bidirectional edges , ie , max(fu,v ,fv,u ) min(fu,v ,fv,u ) . In 83 % Douban pairs and 77 % Goodreads pairs7 , there exists an individual whose social influence on the other is at least as twice as that in the reverse direction . As indicated by this phenomenon , the influence among two friends often acts in an one way manner , although two friends can recommend favorite products to each other and thus have the potential to influence each other . Furthermore , we label ( u , v ) an influence edge , if fu,v is larger than 0.1 and |Iuv| is no less than 5 . In this case , u serves as the influential side and v influenced side . Please note that those roles are assigned in a particular edge rather than a global setting . For the two used datasets , 0.095 % and 2.19 % edges are labeled as influence edges which involve 0.078 % and 7.23 % users , respectively . 6.2
Identification of influential friends
Now we check what correlates with the direction of influence among friends . Intuitively , there are possibly two kinds of factors , namely , the social positions of users in the friendship network and their personal characteristics independent on other individuals . Specifically , for the first kind of factors , we consider the out degree8 , PageRank and Lead7We ignore edges with |Iuv| < 5 whose f could be unreliable . 8We also analyze in degree . Since Douban and Goodreads user user networks are both observed with high reciprocity , the feature in degree has almost the same result as outdegree . erRank . For the second kind of factors , we consider the collection size , collection frequency ( number of items collected per day ) and sensitivity . Note that sensitivity , proposed in this paper , represents an individual ’s ability to quickly discover new valuable contents . Specifically , the sensitivity Su of a user u is defined as
.
Su = i∈I(u ) |{v : i ∈ I(v ) , T ( v , i ) > T ( u , i)}|
. i∈I(u ) |{v : i ∈ I(v)}|
,
( 5 ) where I(u ) denotes the set of items collected by user u and T ( u , i ) is the date when u collects item i . The sensitivity of a user can be explained as the percentage of other users who rates an item later than him/her . For example , if an individual u is the tenth one among all the 100 users who collect The King ’s Speech and the 20th among the 50 users collecting Black Swan , the sensitivity of u can then be calculated as ( 90 + 30)/(100 + 50 ) = 08 u,v
With respect to each feature t , we examine the influentialside to influenced side ratio Rt u,v on each influence edge pointing to v from u . Take the out degree as example , Rout−degree = kout u /kout . Fig 8 shows the probability distribution of logarithm of Rout−degree . It can be observed that the influential side of an influence edge is more probable to have a higher out degree and sensitivity than the influenced side , reflected by the majority population of positive values of logarithm ratio ( deep grey area in figure ) . The ratios with respect to other features also provide evidence on the effectiveness of these features when identifying the influential friends . and Rsensitivity u,v v u,v
A more direct method for discriminating the effectiveness of these features is the accuracy in predicting which individual is the influential side in such a pair of friends , that are ( a ) mutually connected so that either might serve as the influential side , and ( b ) one edge between them is labeled as an influence edge . The results are shown in Table 3 . We can see that almost all the considered features can correctly predict most of the pairs . This implies that a more active individual , from either the social perspective or the personal perspective , is more probable to be the influential side among two friends . We can also see that out degree and sensitivity play the most important role in detecting influential sides . This tells us that an influential friend is more eager to explore new items and followed by many other users .

Focusing on out degree and sensitivity , we detail the experimental results . For each pair of mutually connected individuals u and v , with one and only one labeled influence edge u,v = fu − fv ( u , v ) , we define the gap between u and v as Gf with respect to each feature f , where fu is the value of feature f of user u . Given a threshold δ for the gap , we predict

Figure 8 : The out degree and sensitivity of the influential and influenced sides in bidirectionally connected user pairs . Douban ( left ) and Goodreads ( right ) . edge ( u , v ) as an influence edge if Gf u,v > δ , or edge ( v , u ) v,u = −Gf as an influence edge if Gf u,v > δ . Otherwise , we leave the pair unpredicted . Different gap thresholds lead to different prediction accuracy , ie , the percentage of correctly predicted pairs among all predicted pairs , and cover rate , namely , the percentage of predicted pairs among all pairs . Generally speaking , a larger gap leads to a lower cover rate and a higher accuracy of prediction . This reflects that a tighter judge condition results in more confidence . That is to say , the more imbalanced that two friends are in their out degrees or sensitivity , the more probable that the influence comes from the more social and sensitive side to the other . Fig 9(a ) depicts the accuracy and the cover rate for the two tested datasets . When the cover rate is 100 % , the out degree succeeds at predicting 69.17 % or 71.16 % of all predicted pairs for the two datasets . The accuracy of the feature sensitivity is slightly higher than the out degree , being 69.41 % or 7767 % Note that the accuracy of both features are significantly higher than a random predictor with an expected accuracy of 50 % .
Note that the out degree characterizes the social position of an individual , while the sensitivity describes his/her personal characteristics . An interesting question is that whether these two kinds of features can complement each other when identifying the influential friends . In order to answer this question , we combine these two features to predict the influential side of each influence edge . Intuitively , an influential friend may have both higher out degree and higher sensitivity . Therefore , we integrate these two features into one by combining their influential to influenced ratios as follows
Rcombined u,v
= ( Rsensitive u,v
)λ(Rout−degree u,v
)
( 1−λ ) ,
( 6 ) u,v where the coefficient λ takes a real value in the range [ 0 , 1 ] . Then , we predict the influential side as the one with a larger Rcombined . Fig 9(b ) presents the prediction results with varied λ and the gap threshold δ = 0 . We can see that the prediction accuracy has a single maximum with respect to the value of λ for the two tested datasets . This indicates that a proper combination of out degree and sensitivity can better distinguish an influential side than using only one of these two features . Therefore , it is necessary to combine the social position of individuals and their personal characteristics when identifying the influential friends for social recommendations . y c a r u c c A y c a r u c c A

7 . CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS
In this paper , we empirically analyzed the effects of wordof mouth recommendations on real world online social networks and content sharing communities . Specifically , our analysis indicates that word of mouth recommendations cannot only improve the prior expectation of users , who receive the recommendations , on the recommended items , but also raise their posterior evaluation . We further verified that the raise of the posterior evaluation is directly caused by word of mouth recommendations , through elaborately designed statistical hypothesis tests . Furthermore , we quantified the raise of posterior evaluation by comparing the real ratings presented by receivers of the word of mouth recommendations and the estimated ratings obtained by a classical collaborative filtering recommendation method . The latter are actually employed to approximate the ratings in the case without word of mouth recommendations . Based on the quantification , we proposed a method for investigating a user ’s social influence , ie , the ability of the user to affect a follower ’s posterior evaluation , by examining his/her sensitivity of discovering good items and the number of his/her followers . Through experiments on the Douban and Goodreads datasets , we demonstrated that our method can successfully identify up to 78 % influential friends .
This paper provides a new research perspective , ie , the posterior evaluation , instead of the prior expectation which has been widely researched into . This new perspective is important for devising online word of mouth recommendation methods , aiming to enhance users’ satisfaction and loyalty . However , it is still an open problem to identify the potential individuals whose opinions can influence their social con tacts . In addition , it is of high interest to investigate how social influence propagates in social networks and how multiple word of mouth recommendations accumulate , which are critical to trigger a viral marketing cascade . Whether or not social influence changes across different topics is another interesting problem . Our future work will focus on these important research issues .
In addition , our findings are helpful to developing new applications . For example , shopping sites can promote a product to potential customers by asking their influential friends to make online word of mouth recommendations , instead of using an automatic recommendation system . More importantly , such a marketing strategy might have the potential to improve product sales and overcome the sparsity problem in personalized recommendation , as long as it is carefully designed to avoid fraudulent recommendations .
