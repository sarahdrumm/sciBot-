ABSTRACT We propose a novel structure , the data sharing graph , for characterizing sharing patterns in large scale data distribution systems . We analyze this structure in two such systems and uncover small world patterns for data sharing relationships . Using the data sharing graph for system characterization has potential both for basic science , because we can identify new structures emerging in real , dynamic networks ; and for system design , because we can exploit these structures when designing data location and delivery mechanisms . We conjecture that similar patterns arise in other large scale systems and that these patterns can be exploited for mechanism design .

1 . INTRODUCTION Studies show that the graph in which nodes are Web pages and edges are the associated hyperlinks has small world properties [ 1 , 2 ] . However , this static property is ‘wired’ in the Web structure and does not reflect usage patterns . Usage patterns are captured by the aggregate file popularity distribution which has been shown to follow a Zipf law for the Web [ 3 ] . However , this latter metric does not capture the mapping between users and the subset of files in which each of them is interested : the overall popularity of an individual file appears as an aggregate over all users in the system . We study the relationships that form among users based on the data subsets in which they are interested . We capture and quantify these relationships by modeling the system as a data sharing graph . To this end , we propose a new measure that captures common user interests in data and justify its utility with studies on two data distribution systems : the Web and a highenergy physics collaboration . Our main finding that small world patterns form in the data sharing graph . We conjecture that similar patterns occur in other systems and that to build efficient , decentralized data location and data delivery mechanisms . these patterns can be exploited is
2 . THE DATA SHARING GRAPH We define the data sharing graph of a system as a graph whose nodes are the data consumers in that system , such as users or their machines’ IP addresses . Edges connect pairs of nodes whose activity satisfies a similarity criterion , C : for example , they connect nodes that access at least m common files during a time interval T . We shall later refine this definition on two concrete examples : the Web and a physics collaboration . We use these data sharing graphs to identify data sharing patterns and to evaluate how they vary with C and T . 2.1 The Web Data Sharing Graph For the study of Web traces , we consider a node as an IP address . An edge connects two nodes that fetched at least p same pages or accessed at least s common servers during a T seconds interval . We vary m from 1 to 500 , s from 1 to 10 , and T from 2 minutes to 4 hours . We use the Boeing proxy traces [ 4 ] as a representative sample for the data access pattern in the Web . These traces represent a five day record of all HTTP requests ( more than 20M requests per day ) from a large organization ( Boeing ) to the Web . 2.2 D0 Data Sharing Graph The D0 Experiment [ 5 ] is a collaboration consisting of thousands of physicists at more than 70 institutions in 18 countries . These physicists mine a PetaByte ( c.2003 ) of measured and simulated data . A typical job analyzes and produces new data files . We analyzed logs for the first six months of 2002 , amounting to about 23,000 job runs submitted by more than 300 users and involving more than 2.5 millions requests for about 200,000 distinct files . A node in the D0 data sharing graph is a D0 user . An edge connects two users if they accessed at least one common file during a T day interval . We vary T from one day to a month . 2.3 Data Sharing Graph Characteristics We discover that both these data sharing graphs display smallworld properties . Two characteristics differentiate small world graphs when compared to random graphs of the same size : first , a small average path length , typical of random graphs ; second , a significantly larger clustering coefficient that is independent of graph size . The clustering coefficient captures how many of a node ’s neighbors are connected to each other . One can picture a small world as a graph constructed by loosely connecting a set of almost complete subgraphs . Social networks , in which nodes are people and edges are relationships ; the Web , in which nodes are pages and edges are hyperlinks ; and neural networks , in which nodes are neurons and edges are synapses or gap junctions , are a few of the many examples of small world networks [ 6 ] . The table presents the average path length and the clustering coefficient ( averaged over multiple intervals of equal length ) of data sharing graphs defined by a few different similarity criteria . We compare these metrics with those of random graphs of similar sizes .
