ABSTRACT Physical disabled access is something that most museums consider very seriously . Indeed , legal requirements to do so . However , online disabled access is still a relatively novel field . Most museums have not yet considered the issues in depth . The Human Computer Interface for their websites is normally tested with major browsers , but not with specialist browsers or against the relevant accessibility and validation standards . We consider the current state of the art in this area and mention an accessibility survey of some museum websites .

1 . INTRODUCTION A cartoon in The New Yorker magazine on 5 July 1993 showed a picture of a dog at a computer talking to his friend and saying :
On the Internet , nobody knows you’re a dog .
– Peter Steiner
A significant number of people using the Internet in general and the web in particular have some form of disability that may affect their use of the technology . Of course the World Wide Web Consortium ( W3C ) is aware of the issues [ 9 ] but many sectors still have little awareness of the access problems to their websites . Museums normally pride themselves on the accessibility of their physical buildings but many have yet to make an equivalent effort for their online facilities , despite the fact that legislation is in the offing or already exists in most developed countries .
2 . EXAMPLE MUSEUM WEBSITES It is instructive to consider some museum sites where accessibility has been considered . This is now an aspect that is assessed in the Museums and the Web conference Best of the Web awards Copyright is held by the author . WWW 2003 , May 20 24 , 2003 , Budapest , Hungary . ACM . in the issues
[ wwwarchimusecom/mw2003/best ] As an example , the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County the US [ wwwnhmorg ] has been an exemplary website from the point of view of accessibility . This was largely because someone who is very knowledgeable of involved designed and organized it in house over a number of years . Perhaps the most interesting thing about this and other websites designed with accessibility in mind is that they need look no different on a modern graphical web browser from any other professionally designed website . This demonstrates that designing with accessibility in mind does not mean one has to compromise what is on offer for the able bodied user with good web browsing facilities . The British Museum COMPASS database of a selection of the museum ’s best objects [ wwwthebritishmuseumacuk/compass ] includes a prominent ‘TEXT ONLY’ link at the top of its homepage for disabled users to gain easy access to the available facilities . The information for the graphical and text based information is served from the same database , thus ensuring that both are in step and up to date . The Tate Gallery in London initiated the i Map Project in associated with a major exhibition on Matisse and Picasso in 2002 [ wwwtateorguk/imap ] This was designed to give access for visually impaired people via the web using raised images allowing them to be touched if printed on a special printer . Thus even art galleries that are obviously very visually oriented in general can make efforts to reach out to the blind .
3 . SURVEY RESULTS The Bobby validator [ bobbywatchfirecom ] , which can check for WAI compliance [ 9 ] and also the US Government Section 508 compliance [ wwwsection508gov ] has been used to evaluate the accessibility and usability of 25 UK and 25 international museum and related websites with respect to their disabled accessibility ( and hence usability ) [ 3,5,6 ] . Bobby evaluates web pages for accessibility to users with disabilities . It checks for the presence or absence of particular features , or their characteristics , although it does not explicitly check HTML syntax . The W3C validator is recommended for checking HTML itself [ validatorw3org ] The results of this survey can be found in [ 6 ] . As well as the mechanical check using Bobby , a visual analysis was carried out manually using information provided by Bobby and also with textual browsing ( eg , using an audio browser ) and partial sightedness in mind . Generally the sites faired quite badly with a significant number exhibiting some serious accessibility problems . The overall results for Bobby are shown in Table 1 , extracted from [ 6 ] . Priority 1 errors are most serious and must be corrected to meet the WAI guidelines [ 9 ] . Priority 2 errors should be corrected if possible and Priority 3 errors may be corrected .

4 . OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION An excellent guide with museums specifically in mind is the EdResources.Net Universal Access website by Jim Angus [ wwwedresourcesnet/universalaccess ] This interesting comparison of the accessibility of three museum websites , as well as links to online web page validation services and further relevant resources . In the UK , MAGDA , the Museums & Galleries Disability Association [ wwwmagdaorguk ] is dedicated to improving access to UK museums and galleries for people with disabilities as well as disseminating current best practice . It also provides an online forum for museum and gallery professionals to enable online discussion [ groupsyahoocom/group/magdamail ] The number of books explicitly covering web accessibility has been very limited until recently , but at least three are now available . [ 7 ] was the first book in the area known to the author . [ 8 ] is written by a range of experts , including legal aspects in some detail for example , and as such is perhaps the most authoritative book in this area to date . [ 4 ] , the most recent book , may be more approachable for some web designers . It is hoped that more books in this important subject area will be produced in the future .
5 . CONCLUSION This poster is intended to help raise awareness of the issues concerning disabled access online , especially in the context of museums that are increasingly developing their online resources with ever more sophisticated web technologies . For people with learning disabilities , visual disabilities , and reading text can be completely inaccessible . While in recent years software developers have created electronic screen readers that convert text to speech , few impairments , print based of these programs offer effective control over how the text is displayed and read , nor do they provide flexible reading features . Therefore , for those with visual impairments , learning disabilities , reading disabilities , or language proficiency problems , even electronic text can be difficult to decipher . The World Wide Web poses additional barriers ; while the web provides a great deal of useful , educational information , its reading levels , page design , and emphasis on graphics can make it inaccessible or unusable for some . There is much room for improvement in the reading and speaking qualities of screen readers . The museum website accessibility survey mentioned here [ 6 ] has shown that in order to develop better accessibility the emphasis must be on improved web page coding practice . The coding aspects of web pages is extremely important in ensuring wide accessibility of websites that will be useful to all , both able bodied and disabled alike . This is possible with care and thought , but most web design professionals have yet to attain the skills to do this . It is hoped that this paper will at least raise some awareness and interest in the issues involved , particularly for museums and other public bodies that pride themselves in their accessibility . The Museophile initiative [ wwwmuseophilecom ] , a spinout from South Bank University , aims to help museums online in areas such as e commerce , discussion forums and accessibility . In particular , for online information on web accessibility for museums , see : http://accessmuseophilenet
An expanded paper including fuller details is also available [ 3 ] .
