ABSTRACT Group recommender systems usually provide recommendations to a fixed and predetermined set of members . In some situations , however , there is a set of people ( N ) that should be organized into smaller and cohesive groups , so it is possible to provide more effective recommendations to each of them . This is not a trivial task . In this paper we propose an innovative approach for grouping people within the recommendation problem context . The problem is modeled as a coalitional game from Game Theory . The goal is to group people into exhaustive and disjoint coalitions so as to maximize the social welfare function of the group . The optimal coalition structure is that with highest summation over all social welfare values . Similarities between recommendation system users are used to define the social welfare function . We compare our approach with K Means clustering for a dataset from Movielens . Results have shown that the proposed approach performs better than K Means for both average group satisfaction and Davies Bouldin index metrics when the number of coalitions found is not greater than 4 ( K ≤ 4 ) for a population size of 12 ( N = 12 ) .

INTRODUCTION
Recommendation systems perform personalized recommendation of items that are of potential interest for such a user [ 1 ] . Based on the previously evaluated items , a recommendation system builds a user ’s profile . The similarity of such profile with other users’ profiles ( collaborative filtering ) is thus used to recommend items to the user [ 4 ] .

In some contexts , where groups of people share location or interests , recommendation for individuals may be not that appropriate . Recommending a restaurant for a business lunch , recommendation of a travel destination for a group of friends or a movie recommendation for a family are examples of scenarios where recommendation for a group is more appropriate . In such case , preferences of all group members are considered in order to perform recommendation . Among the difficulties that arise is the fact that group members may have different preferences or even conflicting ones . In order to solve this problem , the approach that has received most attention in scientific literature is the aggregation of individual preferences [ 11 , 9 ] .
Most group recommender systems assumes a fixed and predetermined set of members . In some situations , however , it is not appropriate or even not possible to previously establish a group . In the context of recommender systems , a set of people may be organized into smaller and cohesive groups , so it is possible to provide more effective recommendations to each of them .
There are other reasons that support the idea behind the generation of casual groups : ( i ) people often change their minds , which may justify eventual regrouping and ( ii ) technological issues might constrain the number of groups as well as the group size .
In this paper we propose an approach for grouping people in order to enable proper recommendation . The problem is modeled as a coalitional game from Game Theory . The goal is to group people into disjoint coalitions in such a way the social welfare function of the group is maximized . The optimal coalition structure is thus that with highest summation over all social welfare values . The social welfare function is defined upon the already known similarities between users’ profiles . This means that more homogeneous groups tend to receive better recommendations .
There are some related work concerning group formation in the scientific literature [ 3 , 5 ] . In [ 13 ] , for instance , personality and confidence are used to define coalitions and achieve agreements within the group . The authors claim that the approach seeks to reproduce the behavior of real users during negotiation of items for consumption , trying to identify group leaders and testing the number of people they are able to convince . The author further believes that user ’s personality determines whether its choices are more assertive and cooperative in regards to the group . Another approach [ 5 ] automatically discovers communities of interest ( eg a group of individuals who share and exchange ideas of particular interest ) and produces recommendations for them .
945 For that , it considers ontology based profiles . Each profile measures the user ’s interest in the ontology concepts . Then , these interests are used to form clusters of ontology concepts . As a result , relationships between users on different levels are formed providing a multi level interest network which allows for finding multiple communities of interest . [ 3 ] proposes an algorithm which identifies groups of users whose preferences are similar and recommends items for these groups . Groups of different granularities are created by an algorithm for automatic detection of communities based on modularity . Experimental results show that the quality of the recommendation for the group increases linearly with the number of groups created .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 reviews group recommender systems . Section 3 reviews the Cooperative Game Theory , since it is the theoretic basis of the proposed approach . In Section 4 , we provide a formal definition to the problem of group formation as a coalitional game . Section 5 describes the experiments performed discuss the results . Finally , in Section 6 we present some concluding remarks and further work .
2 . GROUP RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
Although recommendation systems traditionally recommend items for individual users , there is an increasing amount of research focused on recommendation for groups of users [ 12 , 9 ] . In such case , recommendations aim to satisfy a group of users with potentially conflicting interests .
The need for choosing a method of aggregation to generate recommendations is the key characteristic of group recommendation . Although different aggregation strategies differ in the way they manipulate and represent users’ preferences , virtually all of them adopts one of three schemes : ( 1 ) aggregates a single set of individual recommendations , ( 2 ) builds a unique representation model for the group , or ( 3 ) aggregate the ratings/preferences for particular items .
Regarding the problem of groups formation in the context group recommender systems , a group may be characterized as [ 3 , 2 ] :
• Established Group : a number of people who have explicitly decided to be part of a group , due to some long term shared interest ;
• Occasional Group : a number of people doing something together occasionally . Members have a common purpose at a particular time ;
• Random Group : a number of people who share the same environment at a particular time , with no clear motivation to be tied ;
• Automatically Identified Group : groups that are automatically detected considering members’ preferences and/or available resources .
A large set of different aggregation functions for individual preferences defined in the Social Choice Theory are known in the literature of group recommender systems . Average is one of the most well known aggregation strategies . It assumes equal importance to group members and computes the average of the group evaluation for the items . The disadvantage of this strategy is due to the heavy reliance on group size . For groups with fewer members , for instance , each member opinion has a greater impact on the average . The Average function seeks to find the central tendency of a sample ( equation 1 ) . u∈g
ˆp(g , i ) =
1 |g|
ˆp(u , i )
( 1 ) where ˆp(u , i ) is the predicted evaluation for each user u and every item i . ˆp(g , i ) is the final prediction value of item i to the group .
Each aggregation strategy has advantages and disadvantages , so some comparison criteria has been defined [ 9 ] . One of them consists in to maximize the average group satisfaction . Previously , it is necessary to calculate the average individual satisfaction for recommended items ( equation 2 ) .
S(u , R ) =
1 |R|
ˆp(u , i )
( 2 ) where R is the set of recommended items and ˆp(u , i ) is the predicted evaluation value of user u for item i ∈ R .
The value of the average group satisfaction to recommen dation R is computed by Equation 3 . i∈R u∈g
S(g , R ) =
1 |g|
S(u , R )
( 3 ) where g is the user group and S(u , R ) is the average sat isfaction of each group member for recommendation R .
3 . COOPERATIVE GAME THEORY
In Game Theory [ 15 ] , a cooperative game [ 14 ] is a game where a group of players , a coalition C , may enforce cooperative behavior . The game is thus a competition between coalitions of players rather than a competition between individual players . A cooperative game comprises a set of n players ( typically n > 2 ) and Ag = {1 , n} as the set of all these players . The subsets of Ag are possible coalitions . The great coalition is a coalition where C = Ag .
Formally , a cooperative is a tuple
G = Ag , v , where Ag is a set of players and v : 2Ag → R is called the characteristic function of the game . The characteristic function of the game assigns to each possible coalition a numeric value that intuitively represents the utility ( or payoff ) that can be distributed among coalition members .
If the entire system is known as single designer , the performance of individual players may not be relevant . Instead , it is concerned with maximizing the system ’s social welfare , ie , maximizing the summation over individual coalitions .
A coalition structure is a partition of the full set of players Ag on mutually disjoint coalitions . From the set Ag = {1 , 2 , 3} , for instance , seven different coalitions
{1},{2},{3},{1 , 2},{2 , 3},{3 , 1},{1 , 2 , 3}
946 and five different coalition structures
{{1},{2},{3},{{1},{2 , 3}},{{2},{1 , 3}},{{3},{1 , 2}},{{1 , 2 , 3}} . may be provided . Given a coalitional game G = Ag , v , an optimal coalition structure CS∗ associated to G is given by :
∗
CS
= arg where
CS ∈ partitions de Ag max
V ( CS )
( 4 )
C∈CS
V ( CS ) = v(C )
( 5 ) consists of the summation over the utility for each coali tion from a given coalition structure .
4 . PROBLEM FORMALIZATION
Let I = {i1 , i2 , , in} and U = {u1 , u2 , , uk} be the set of all items and all users , respectively . Consider a set G of all groups with at least two members that may be formed by U and so , |G| = 2k − k − 1 . Consider , finally , g ∈ G and |g| defined as the number m of group members g . If , for instance , a group consists of users u1 , u2 and u3 , thus this can be expressed as g = {u1 , u2 , u3} and |g| .
Let us assume p(u , i ) as the evaluation for the item i usersupplied u , and p(u , i ) = 0 , if user u did not evaluate the item i . Consider ˆp(u , i ) as the predictive assessment of item i for user u . The predicted evaluation ˆp(u , i ) is obtained from a prediction function ˆp which considers , in turn , the similarity between items s : I × I → R or the similarity between users s : U × U → R .
Backtracking technique is used to find all possible combinations of users to form groups . The algorithm performs in O(2n ) .
The social welfare function to compute the payoff for each group is shown in Equation 6 :
( sim(ui , uj ) ) n2−n f = nα +
,
( 6 ) where n is the number of group members and sim(ui , uj ) is the cosine similarity between two members ( Equation 7 ) :
2 ui · uj uiuj sim(ui , uj ) = cos(θ ) =
( 7 ) The result of the similarity lies in the interval [ −1 , 1 ] , where −1 means users have opposite profiles , 1 means same profiles , and 0 indicates independence or orthogonality . Intermediate values indicate some similarity or dissimilarity levels . Similarity is calculated between all group members so to provide a similarity matrix , which is symmetric and the values of main diagonal equals to 1 . The summation is performed over the n2 − n2 values above the main diagonal . The arithmetic mean favors groups with greater similarity between group members .
The factor nα is used to enable the variation on how the size of the group weights its payoff . A higher α encourages the formation of larger groups and so , coalition structures with fewer elements . Conversely , lower α values encourages the formation of smaller groups and thus , coalition structures with more elements . For α = 1 group payoff is independent of the group size . n(cid:92 )
Recommendation procedure selects items belonging to the intersection of the lists with rating predictions for each group member , individually ( Equation 8 ) :
H =
{i | ˆp(u , i ) = ∅ , i ∈ I}
( 8 ) u=1
In such approach , the game should answer the question Which coalitions can be formed ? . As a consequence , the system assumes the role of single designer and does not need to deal with other cooperative games issues like How the payoff should be distributed among the coalition members ?
Backtracking is once again used to find the whole set of coalition structures in order to find that which maximizes the summation over the payoff of all its coalitions ( CS∗ ) . This performs in O(2k ) , with k being the number of possible coalitions .
As an illustrative example , consider the table 1 which contains six individual preferences and their ratings for five different items .

5 . EXPERIMENTS
Experiments have been performed in order to compare the proposed approach with K Means clustering algorithm . 5.1 Dataset
The MovieLens 1 datasets are widely used in group recommendation research even though they do not actually provide information on groups . This is due to the complete lack of other well established and more suitable bases with groups information . The chosen dataset consists of 943 users , 1,682 movies and 100,000 movie ratings in the [ 1 , 5 ] interval .

We note a strong negative correlation of 0.97 between the α value and the number of groups provided by the proposed approach , which confirms the rationale of Equation 6 ( Table 4 ) .
Table 2 shows that better satisfaction ( utility ) and DB index values are achieved with lower values of α , which suggests that smaller groups ensures greater similarity between group members . For K ≤ 4 and α ≥ 1 , 004 , the proposed approach has achieved better results if compared to K means clustering . This is shown if we compare both satisfaction ( utility ) and DB index values of last 7 ( seven ) lines of Table 2 ( 2.1 ≤ K ≤ 3.7 , considering the nearest integer ) with the first 3 ( three ) lines of Table 3 ( 2 ≤ K ≤ 4 ) .

5.2 Experimentation setup
A list of rating predictions to every movie not yet seen by neither user in a group has been generated from individual evaluations p(u , i ) existent in the dataset . The rating predictions were generated by means of a collaborative filtering algorithm based on KNN ( K Nearest Neighbor ) [ 7 ] . Figure 1 shows distribution histogram . Predictions have a mean value of 4.01 and low standard deviation of 041 In order to generate the optimal coalition structure ( CS∗ ) , 10 sets of 12 users of the MovieLens dataset have been randomly generated . n = 12 was the largest number of users with which all method ’s iterations could be performed in a reasonable time , due to time complexity issue . The value of α was varied empirically in the range of 0.999 and 1.010 for each iteration .
K Means [ 10 ] has been similarly applied to the same 10 sets of 12 users for comparison purposes . Initial centroids were chosen randomly and K was varied in the interval of 2 to 6 for each iteration . 5.3 Evaluation metrics
A metric for clustering evaluation known as Davies Bouldin index ( DB ) [ 8 ] was used ( Equation 9 ) :
σi + σj d(ci , cj )
( 9 ) n i=1
DB =
1 n max i=j where n is the number of clusters , cx is the centroid of the cluster x , σx is the average distance of all the elements in cluster x to centroid cx , and d(Ci , ji ) is the distance between the centroid Ci and cj .
Good clustering produces clusters with low intra cluster distance ( high internal similarity between cluster elements ) and high inter cluster distances ( low similarity between clusters ) . Better clustering algorithms produces lower DaviesBouldin index values . 5.4 Experimentation results

6 . CONCLUSION
This paper proposes an approach based on the generation of coalitional structures in a cooperative game to maximize the total social welfare of the groups of users formed in the context of group recommender systems . Coalitions formation is performed by means of a payoff function which considers the similarity between members of the coalition , concerning items ratings previously provided in the recommendation system , and a weighting factor for the coalition size .
Experiments with a MovieLens dataset were used to compare this approach with the state of the art K Means clustering . The results show better performance of the proposed approach in the formation of larger coalitions , considering two different metrics : the average group satisfaction and Davies Bouldin index , which is commonly used to evaluate mainstream clustering algorithms . Furthermore , the approach does not depend on previously established K value to provide clustering , an important known limitation of K Means .
Results show the feasibility of the proposal to provide group formation for further recommendation tasks in contexts where there are no reason to predefine groups .
Future work intend to extend experimentation with real users of the MyPopCorn2 recommendation system , an application that runs on Facebook . Friendship levels between group members might be used to compute the payoff of the coalition structure .
Another future work is related to the comparison of the approach proposed in this paper with other clustering methods such as the Hierarchical Clustering [ 6 ] .
Finally , a further work intends to deal with the fairness of the recommendation provided to the formed group . The research hypothesis is that it could be done by finding the set of items to be recommended that better approximates the the Shapley value of each group member .
