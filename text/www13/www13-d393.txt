ABSTRACT The Internet has become an important source for media content . Content types are not limited to text and pictures but also include video and audio . Currently audiovisual media is presented as it is . However , these media do not integrate the huge amount of related information , which is available on the Web . In this paper we present the Chrooma+ approach to improve the user experience of media consumption by enriching media content with additional information from various sources in the Web . Our approach focuses on the aggregation and combination of this related information with audiovisual media . This approach involves using new HTML5 technologies and with WebVTT a new annotation format to display relevant information at definite times . Some of the advantages of this approach are the usage of a rich annotation format and extensibility to include heterogeneous information sources .

1 . INTRODUCTION Recently , the market of media is changing dramatically . The Web becomes a more important way of distributing audiovisual content or text based information . In addition , the increasing spread of Internet connections with high bandwidth facilitates the delivery of media content , such as video or audio , to end users . We define end users as people consuming media in front of any device capable of displaying media , such as TVs , computers and mobile devices . Simultaneously , the Internet offers a rich source of information to enrich this media content .
More than half the users who are online are dealing with video platforms like YouTube [ 1 , 3 ] . While these platforms are limited to show only video content , the Chrooma+ approach describes how to enrich media content with widgets containing related information such as text , pictures , videos or maps . We consider video content as the visual part of a video whereas the metadata of the video is the other part . The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate our approach by using Web technologies such as HMTL5 which offers the opportunity to stream video easily via HTTP [ 2 ] .
This paper is structured as follows : We provide an overview of our demonstration . This section will also examine the technical aspects , including the HTML5 features used , the research on WebVTT [ 5 ] and our current prototype , which we will present during demonstration sessions . Finally , we offer an outlook to further developments .
2 . DEMONSTRATION The mission of the Chrooma+ project is to build a platform that facilitates the time oriented composition of media streams with HTML components or widgets . One of the current approaches to enrich media with additional information is popcornjs1 In contrast to popcorn.js , where all annotations are described in custom JavaScript files , we are using a separate WebVTT file . Therefore , it is highly adjustable and provides support for extensions . Currently , the annotations have to be written manually , but our project partners are working on an automatic annotation framework .
2.1 VIDEO WITH HTML5 The new video element in HTML5 offers the opportunity to display enriched media . While many browsers support the video element itself by now , support for video codecs varies heavily . Therefore , the opportunity of including several <source> elements is important for the accessibility of content . This demo exhibits media enrichment , by means of the <track> element by including explicitly timed annotations . The support of the <track> element is under development . Currently this feature is supported by Chrome 23+ [ 4 ] , IE 10 , Opera 12.10 and Safari 6 [ 6 ] . Additionally , Mozilla is working on the support in Firefox . Apart from this , there is no support in mobile browsers .
The HTML code example listed below shows the exemplary use of the <video> and <track> element in our demo . The track element with the attribute “ kind ” set to “ metadata ” is not displayed by browsers , but accessible for JavaScript components through the text track API . Thus , it does not collide with regular subtitles . We intend to display the annotations at explicit timestamps . Therefore , we use a JavaScript event provided by the <track> element . The “ oncuechange ” event is fired when a

<video id="demo" controls >
<source src="demovideo.webm" type="video/webm"> <source src="demovideo.mp4" type="video/mp4"> <track src="metadata.vtt" label="Metadata" kind="metadata" default>
</video>
2.2 ANNOTATIONS WITH WEBVTT The approach to use the HTML5 <video> and <track> element was chosen because as yet there is no support in browsers for a video format which can contain additional metadata in one container . We use an external annotation format combined with supported standard video formats . This offers the possibility to adapt our approach to many scenarios . Furthermore , the use of WebVTT provides the option to use JSON to describe annotations . A sample data structure extracted from the demonstration annotation is illustrated in Figure 1 . The flexibility of JSON enables the creator of annotations to properly specify the information and provides the capability to use plugins .
The WebVTT file contains several cues consisting of an optional identifier , an explicit timestamp and the cue payload , which can contain any text content . The timestamp is given in “ hh:mm:ss.ttt ” format , describing the hours , minutes , seconds and thousandths of a second in prescribed order .
2.3 PRESENTATION OF OUR DEMO A first implementation of our approach is the core of our demonstration2 . We are presenting a promotion video from the Chemnitz University of Technology , which is annotated and then combined with several widgets showing related information . Based on jQuery we implemented a script , which uses the “ oncuechange ” event to synchronize the video with the annotations from the metadata file . The specified information is processed and displayed as a widget in a predefined way . The position of the widgets must not be on top of the video . They can also be placed next to it . In further developments end users shall be able to move the widgets . The demonstration uses several Web service APIs to enrich media . One example service is Google Maps , which is used to search for a specified location and display this location on a

Additionally , we included information from Wikipedia to provide the users with an advanced possibility to inform themselves about the topic . Furthermore , a connector for Google+ was implemented , which facilitates the opportunity to create a relation between individuals seen in the video and their social profiles . Figure 1 shows the architecture of our implementation and the result of media enrichment .
3 . LESSONS LEARNED AND OUTLOOK Our first experiments show that the composition of video and related Web content using HTML5 techniques works . First user interviews for gathering requirements for our new platform show high interest in the topic . The combination of WebVTT and widgets is challenging , as the loading behavior of some widgets has to be taken into account . We are currently working on a video mashup platform that allows users to specify the video streams and corresponding Web content . This results in an enriched media stream improving the user experience in media consumption .
