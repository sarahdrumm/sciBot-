ABSTRACT Microblog has become an increasing valuable resource of upto date topics about what is happening in the world . In this paper , we propose a novel approach of detecting realtime events in microblog streams based on bursty sentiments detection . Instead of traditional sentiment orientation like positive , negative and neutral , we use sentiment vector as our sentiment model to abstract subjective messages which are then used to detect bursts and clustered into new events . Experimental evaluations show that our approach could perform effectively for online event detection . Although we worked with Chinese in our research , the technique can be used with any other language .

INTRODUCTION
Millions of users are sharing their views and discussing current issues through microblog every day , which makes microblog become a new valuable social media for public opinion mining . Unlike traditional social media , microblog which messages emerge in high rate contains massive volume and too much noise , making it much more challengeable to detect online events in real time streams .
An effective way to detect events is using bursty features in data streams and rich research has been conducted on this area . Early in 2002 , for example , Kleinberg proposed a formal approach to extract meaningful documents based on modeling the stream using an infinite state automaton in which bursts appear naturally as state transitions[2 ] . And in [ 1 ] , a new temporal representation for text streams based on bursty features combining with TFIDF was proposed . All those methods , which are very useful on long documents like news or blogs , may encounter disadvantages in microblog which only contains 140 words . First , it will take a long time to detect bursty features in massive messages . Second , noisy messages contain many bursty variation of Chinese words which those approaches may not recognize effectively .

Figure 1 : The framework of our model
Sentiment analysis(aka opinion mining ) extracts subjective information from documents using natural language processing , computational linguistics and text analytics techniques . There is a strong correlation between bursty events and public moods , which means that there are always bursty sentiments with in the bursty events . For example , scared and sad emerge in large numbers if there is an earthquake . Inspired by this , we can detect new events by monitoring sentiment states in microblog streams . It is unnecessary to detect other bursty features , which makes online event detection available on massive data streams .
To the best of our knowledge , the work most related to ours is Nguyen ’s study[3 ] , which also detected bursty events based on sentiments . The two methods , however , have some fundamental differences . Nguyen ’s method focused on long documents while we targets at microblog messages . Besides , we use a sentiment vector model in our early work in [ 4 ] with hierarchical structure to abstract subjective messages and the framework of our proposed model is different from theirs .
The rest of this paper is organized as follows . we present our model and event detection methods in Section 2 , and report some selected empirical study results in Section 3 .
2 . MODEL AND METHODS 2.1 Problem Definitio
Let D = {dt1
1 , dt2
2 , dt3
3 ,··· } is the microblog stream where i , and S =< S1 , S2,···S m > ti means the post time of message dti is the sentiment vector proposed in [ 4 ] where Sj represents a sentiment . So the sentiment vector of a message d can be defined as Sd =< δ1 d = 1 if the message d contains sentiment Sk and δk d = 0 otherwise . For a period T and a certain sentimen Si , we define DT d as the messages sets which contains sentiment Sk , and Bk =< d > where δk d,·· ·δ m d∈DT δk
Sk = d , δ2
.
781 2 , ···b k . bk 1 , bk p > as the bursty periods of sentiment Sk where bk j means the jth detected bursty period of sentiment Sk . ei is the event set where ei = {wi1 , wi2,··· , wip} Let E = is an event presenting by words . So our purpose is to detect new events in microblog stream D by using the features of bursty sentiments S . 2.2 Method Description
The framework of our method is illustrated in Figure 1 . We first detect bursty sentiments in data streams . Then , we use the subjective messages to detect new events after three modules : Named Entity Recognition , Clustering and Co event Detection . Finally , Bayesian Classification is performed to recycle the candidate messages into final events . 221 Bursty Sentiment Detection We use the sentiment vector model proposed in our early work in [ 4 ] to perform sentiment abstraction . The model contains 284 Chinese words including new Internet words and common emoticons , and is automatically classified into 37 categories . For the messages containing no sentiments , like objective microblogs , we put them into a candidate set setC1 . For those subjective messages , we perform Principal Component Analysis to detect the main sentiments in time window T . For each main sentiments Sk , we detect its bursty periods Bk and the corresponding messages set Dbk Sk using Kleinberg ’s methods proposed in [ 2 ] . 222 Event Detection based on Sentiment Messages For each Dbk Sk , Named Entity Recognition is performed , and the messages with no time , location will be put into candidate set setC2 . We then use spectral clustering to detect the events in each Dbk Sk . Here , we think the named entities weight higher than the other words , and use a parameter λ to adjust the weights while computing similarity between two messages as Sim(di , dj ) = λSimNE + ( 1− λ)Simothers . Finally , we integrate co occurrence events . Event e1 in sentiment Si and event e2 in Sj will be merged as one event only if ∃k , st(bi k ) > θ1 and ( e1·e2)/(||e1||·||e2|| ) > θ2 where θ1 and θ2 are thresholds . 223 Recycling Messages in candidate setC1 and setC2 also contain some information about events , especially the objective messages in setC1 . In order to make precise event abstraction , we build a Naive Bayes classifier to absorb the information in the candidate sets . The event messages we have detected above could be considered as the training corpus . And a messages d in candidate sets belongs to an existing event eionly if the P ( ei|d ) > θ3 . k ∩bj k∪bj k)/(bi
3 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 3.1 Dataset
We worked with Chinese microblogs in SINA . By using API , we collected 3,923,641 messages from July 25th to Aug . 15 , 2012 during the London Olympic Games . 3.2 Results and Discussions
In order to make real time event detection , we set the time window T = 1 hour . Figure 2 shows the changes of two typical sentiments by hour . Here , we use the proportion of
0.25 s t n e m i t n e S
0.2
Happy Angry f
0.15 t o e g a n e c r e P
0.1
0.05

Figure 2 : Changes of two typical sentiments by hour a certain sentiments in all subjective messages rather than the absolute number . We can see that the sentiment happy almost burst each day , yet angry burst only in certain times . In fact , each time China got a medal , there was a growth in sentiment happy and we really detected all the medal events during the Games . We selected top − 5 events for each time window as hot events . As manually examining all the events is prohibitively expensive , we chose 50 time periods randomly to evaluate the effects of our proposed model and the average precision is 86.3 %
The framework of our model is quite efficient .
In fact , almost 62 % messages are objective messages , so most messages will be put into candidate set setC1 until recycling in the last module . Besides , although there are 37 categories of sentiments in our sentiment vector model , only around 5 types are main sentiment after the process of principal component analysis on average . So it will not take a long time to detect bursts .
