ABSTRACT Political campaigning and the corresponding advertisement money are increasingly moving online . Some analysts claim that the US elections were partly won through a smart use of ( i ) targeted advertising and ( ii ) social media . But what type of information do politicized users consume online ? And , the other way around , for a given content , eg a YouTube video , is it possible to predict its political audience ? To address this latter question , we present a large scale study of anonymous YouTube video consumption of politicized users , where political orientation is derived from visits to “ beacon pages ” , namely , political partisan blogs . Though our techniques are relevant for targeted political advertising , we believe that our findings are also of a wider interest .

INTRODUCTION
In the run up to the US presidential elections 2012 , political campaigning happened increasingly through social media and social networks . Such campaigning goes beyond maintaining a Facebook page or a Twitter account ; it tries to target individual users who are likely to be responsive to the political message . For a given type of apolitical content , say , a YouTube video of a cute kitten , is it possible to predict the political leaning of its audience ?
We use a large data set of anonymous browsing behavior to analyze “ the political YouTube user ” . We infer a user ’s likely political orientation through visited political blogs . Using such a set of labeled users , we study the problem of predicting which audience , in terms of political orientation , watches a given YouTube video . We do this not with political campaign videos in mind , but rather to unearth relationships with , say , the music genre of a music video . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study of online browsing and video consumption from the angle of political orientation .
2 . RELATED WORK
The importance of targeting political online ads to “ the right users ” has been recognized by politicians , in particular in the United

States [ 6 , 12 , 5 , 13 ] and parties have undergone painstaking efforts to collect huge amounts of data “ by hand ” [ 8 ] , gathering details about individual voters . In our work , we take an algorithmic approach to data collection . The problem of classifying YouTube videos using tags according to political leaning of the viewership is related to political text classification in general . This problem has been studied before in the context of party programs and labeled text sets [ 9 , 14 ] , news articles [ 4 ] and hyper text documents [ 3 ] and users [ 11 , 15 ] . Though certain elements such as using tokens as features are shared with these works , the data set and overall setting are completely different .
3 . DATA SET
The anonymous browsing data was collected through a toolbar of a large internet company . For users who give their explicit consent , this toolbar logs all of the browser ’s page views , including redirect page views caused when , eg , clicking a search result on a search engine . For secure HTTPs connections , no dynamic URL parameters and only the static URL prefix is stored . The user based sample we collected contained all logged page views for 13 months ( March 2011 April 2012 ) for millions of distinct users . For simplicity , we always equate an anonymous toolbar ID with an individual user . We removed users with less than 1,000 or more than 2,000,000 page views as the former are likely to use another “ main ” computer and the latter are likely internet cafes , virus infected computers or other abnormal cases . We also removed users who , based on their IP address were located outside the United States of America . For all page views to youtube.com/watch?v= we extracted the corresponding video id . Using YouTube ’s API we obtained the video ’s title , tags and category .
As the political leaning of blogs read online largely aligns with the leaning of the user reading them [ 10 ] , we obtained the handcrafted lists of blogs annotated with a political leaning from [ 1 ] and the Wonkosphere Blog Directory1 . Re directs were corrected and abandoned blogs removed . In the end 1,099 blogs ( 644 right , 387 left , 68 center ) remained . We then used these blogs to label users as “ L ” if ( i ) all of their political page views2 were on left leaning blogs and ( ii ) these views occurred on at least two distinct sites . The labeling as “ R ” was analogous . We labeled a user as “ C ” if no more than 70 % of his political page views on political blogs were on sites of either a left or right leaning . All other users were considered unlabeled . The final user counts were 18.3k , 1.1k , 4.0k , for L , C , and R respectively . Users without a ground truth label were dropped from further analysis . 1http://wonkospherecom/directoryhtm 2We trained a token based URL classifier to tell political from apolitical blog pages as huffingtonpost.com and other sites also host non political , celebrity related content .

Among brand advertisers , online video advertising is one of the fastest growing segments , together with mobile and social media advertising . In the political domain the corresponding targeting problem translates to : given a video , can we predict the political leaning of its online audience ? Here , we limit our scope to YouTube , the biggest online video platform . For each video watched directly on wwwyoutubecom/watch , rather than re branded channels , we counted how many labeled users watched it . Note that embedded video views via barackobama.com/videos/ or mittromney.com/videos/ are not contained in this set . For videos with at least 50 distinct users we computed the fraction of L , C and R users . There were 10,659 such videos . Macro averaged across all videos , political or not , the fractions were 73.6%L , 17.1%C and 9.3%R , differing considerably from the overall user distribution . The videos with highest L , C and R fractions were bit.ly/ AexUVS , bit.ly/nH2UI and bit.ly/xdzHtX respectively , of which only the last one is actually political . With advertising opportunities in mind , we were more interested in apolitical videos , eg political trends concerning music videos . Finding such correlations is similar to the work described in [ 2 ] and the targeting of reruns “ TV Land ” for political advertising [ 6 ] . Thus , we removed videos with popular political tags containing “ obama ” , “ republican ” , “ politic ” and a dozen others . We split the set of apolitical videos into 9,972 training videos and 500 test videos . For the training set we trained three separate linear SVM regression models to predict each of the L , C and R fractions given only its category as well as its title tokens and tags , ignoring tokens appearing in less than 10 videos . To better understand the prediction performance , we also evaluated a simple baseline model which always predicts the average value for each of L , C and R .

( a ) Performance , both absolute error and RMSE , for the linear SVM regression models for the L fraction for the biggest categories . All values are for the same , category agnostic classifier with the category as one of its features . top “ L ” top “ C ” tit:beyonce tag:r&b tag:soul tag:whitney tag:viral tit:temptations tit:houston tit:spongebob tit:mating tag:boyz tag:country tag:rock tag:nashville tag:car cat:autos tag:jason tag:ray tit:live tit:road tit:mom top “ R ” tit:mp4 tag:marine tag:land tag:marines tit:commercial tag:navy tag:every tag:were tag:israel tit:haggard
( b ) The 10 strongest positive features from each of the three linear SVM models . R&B music appears indicative of a left leaning , while interest in military videos indicates a right leaning .
Table 1a summarizes the performance of our L model , with the other two models performing comparably . Overall the reductions in root mean squared error ( RMSE ) , compared to the baseline , are L : 7.67 → 7.14 , C : 5.28 → 5.07 , R : 5.89 → 5.55 , all fairly small . This bad news for the classifier is , arguably , good news for society as it indicates that general YouTube videos are not polarized enough to be easily told apart . However , there are peculiar differences across video categories , with the “ Education ” category having a relative improvement of 22 % in RMSE over the baseline for L , with 13 % for C and 8 % for R . Apart from the overall regression performance , we analyzed which features were indicative of a given leaning . Table 1b shows the 15 strongest positive features for each of the linear SVM models . A “ tag : ” prefix indicates a tag , “ tit : ” a title and “ cat : ” a category token .
We conclude by noting that videos matching the string “ kitten ” follow the overall L C R background distribution for videos . Reassuringly , kittens appear to be apolitical and universally adored . However , adding features may make such seemingly innocuous information reveal sensitive personal attributes too [ 7 ] .
