ABSTRACT We demonstrate that psychological models of utility discounting can explain the pattern of increased hits to weather websites in the days preceding a predicted weather disaster . We parsed the HTTP request lines issued by the web proxy for a mid sized enterprise leading up to a hurricane , filtering for visits to weather oriented websites . We fit four discounting models to the observed activity and found that our data matched hyperboloid models extending hyperbolic discounting .

INTRODUCTION
In behavioral economics and psychology , researchers use the term “ discounting ” to describe the phenomenon whereby a subject decreases its valuation of a potential reward as a function of increasing delay or increasing uncertainty . For instance , when presented with a choice between two rewards that differ in delay , human and animal subjects tend to select the reward that is delivered sooner , sometimes even when it has a lower objective utility [ 5 ] . In this paper we examine the fit of four common discounting models to our experimental data , which is derived directly from network protocol logs reflecting human driven behavior on an enterprise network . This data was collecting during the weekend leading up to the local touchdown of Hurricane Sandy , and is an instance of human network usage activity leading up to imminent natural disaster . Hence , our analysis seeks to model human information seeking behavior leading up to a crisis .

[ 8 ] , we believe a fundamental understanding of the psychological phenomena at work could lead to better predictions about behavior during rare events , such as natural disasters , complementing work that relies on user behavior to detect trends [ 7 ] . While hyperbolic discounting has been used previously to describe various economic phenomena [ 3 ] , we claim novelty in using it to explain network traffic .
2 . METHODOLOGY
2.1 Human data
Hurricane Sandy touched down on the Northeast coast of the United States early in the morning on Monday , October 29 , 2012 . We collected the HTTP request lines issued by the web proxy for a mid sized enterprise from 6 pm Friday , October 26 , 2012 until 9 am Monday , October 29 , 2012 . These request lines were attributable to 1207 distinct users of the enterprise network who were active during this time period . We filtered this corpus of request lines for GET requests to 19 popular weather related websites . We assume that this filtered corpus is representative of and proportional to the total weather forecast seeking behavior of the enterprise userbase during the observed time period . 2.2 Analysis
We restrict our analysis of the dataset described in Section 2.1 to between 10 am and 11 pm on the days of collection , being the period of greatest activity . For each hour in question , we counted the number of distinct users to issue an HTTP request , and divided by the total number of users . The result is a mean probability that a user will seek out weather information within a particular hour . We interpret this probability as being proportional to the mean perceived utility of learning about the weather at the hour in question . We assume that the users knew that the last chance to do so prior to the hurricane would be late Sunday evening .
A discounting factor ρ(D ) at some delay D allows us to compute the subjective value V ( D ) of a reward A by setting V ( D ) = Aρ(D ) . So , if P ( D ) is the probability drawn from the distribution of our userbase at D , then P ( D ) ∝ Aρ(D ) . Thus , P ( D ) = µρ(D ) where µ is a constant of proportion

The following discounting equations allow us to compute V ( D ) = µρ(D ) . The traditional model used in economics to predict discounting behavior [ 5 ] posits time consistent , exponential discounting :
V = µekD
( 1 )
Here k parameterizes the discounting rate , and ρ(D ) = ekD is the exponential discounting factor . However , more recent experimental results in behavioral economics [ 3 ] and psychology [ 2 ] suggest that both humans and animals discount rewards in a time inconsistent manner . Researchers commonly use hyperbolic discounting [ 4 ] to model this behavior :
V = µ/(1 − kD )
( 2 )
Evidence in the literature suggests that ( 2 ) is not sufficiently sensitive to changes in perceived value over differing delays to explain discounting behavior in humans [ 1 ] . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are extensions to hyperbolic discounting that introduce a sensitivity parameter s that models the sensitivity to the scaling of delay [ 1 ] or the delay itself [ 6 ] , respectively .

These findings support the notion that traffic patterns before important events can be explained by some utility discounting model , though which is best is still uncertain . These results may be extended to predict traffic before deadlines , and be used to anticipate factors such as website load .

We fit each of the above models to the dataset described in Section 2.2 , providing parameter estimates for equations ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) . Also note that ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) reduce to ( 2 ) when s = 1 , so deviation from 1 as well as a better coefficient of determination ( R2 ) in the learned model is needed to justify the added model complexity .
3 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table 1 displays the learned parameters for each of the models , as well as their associated R2 statistics . Figure 1 plots the best fit curves for models ( 1 ) through ( 4 ) against the observed data . Based on a purely qualitative assessment , note that while all of the curves capture the general trend of the observed valuations , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are much more visually successful at capturing the leveling off behavior of the data with increasing delay until 10pm Sunday . Additionally , we see that among the two parameter models , ( 2 ) outperforms ( 1 ) according to their R2 statistics , as well as having a better visual fit to data in Figure 1 . However , both three parameter models ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) exhibit very similar curves and similar R2 statistics . This confirms previous research indicating the difficulty in quantitatively deciding between these two models [ 5 ] . Whether their better fit is worth their additional complexity is a matter of taste . delayed reinforcement . In M . L . Commons , J . E . Mazur , J . A . Nevin , and H .
