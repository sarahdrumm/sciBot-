ABSTRACT Complex networks of real world systems are believed to be controlled by common phenomena , producing structures far from regular or random . These include scale free degree distributions , small world structure and assortative mixing by degree , which are also the properties captured by different random graph models proposed in the literature . However , many ( non social ) real world networks are in fact disassortative by degree . Thus , we here propose a simple evolving model that generates networks with most common properties of real world networks including degree disassortativity . Furthermore , the model has a natural interpretation for citation networks with different practical applications .

INTRODUCTION
Networks are the simplest representation of complex systems of interacting parts . Examples of these are ubiquitous in practice , including large social networks [ 5 ] , information systems [ 18 ] and cooperate ownerships [ 22 ] , to name just a few . Despite a seemingly plain form , real world networks reveal characteristic structural properties that are absent from regular or random systems [ 23 , 2 ] . Thus , networked systems are believed to be controlled by common phenomena .
Scale free degree distributions [ 2 ] , small world phenomena [ 23 ] , degree mixing [ 14 ] ( ie , degree correlations at links’ ends ) and existence of communities [ 6 ] ( ie , densely linked groups of nodes ) are perhaps among most widely analyzed properties of large real world networks . Note that community structure implies assortative ( i.e , positively correlated ) mixing by degree [ 16 ] , which can be seen as a tendency of hubs ( ie , highly linked nodes ) to cluster together . The above are also the properties captured by many random graph models proposed in the literature [ 9 , 11 , 13 , 24 ] .
However , most ( non social ) networks deviate from this figure . Biological and technological networks are in fact degree disassortative ( ie , negatively correlated ) , while different information networks often reveal no clear degree mixing [ 14 , 7 ] ( see Figure 1 ) . Thus , we here propose an evolving random graph model based on the link copying mechanism [ 9 ] . Each newly added node explores the network using the burning process in [ 11 ] , while links of the visited nodes are copied independently of the latter . The model generates scale free small world networks with community structure and also degree disassortativity . Furthermore , it has a natural interpretation for citation networks . The above process imitates an author of a paper including references into the bibliography ( ie , its citation dynamics ) , which enables different practical applications in bibliometrics ( see Section 32 )
The rest of the paper is structured as follows . Section 2 introduces the proposed ( Citation ) model , while a thorough analysis is given in Section 3 . Section 4 concludes the paper .
2 . THE CITATION MODEL Let a network be represented by a simple graph G(N , L ) , where N is the set of nodes , |N| = n , and L is the set of links , |L| = m . Next , let Γi be the set of neighbors of node i ∈ N and let ki be its degree , ki = |Γi| . Last , let k be the mean degree and kN the mean neighbor degree .
Proposed graph model is based on the burning process of Forest Fire model [ 11 ] , which we introduce first . Due to simplicity , the model is presented for undirected networks .

Figure 2 : Schematic representation of linking dynamics of different graph models . ( a ) In Forest Fire model [ 11 ] , newly added node i selects an ambassador a ( blue node ) uniformly at random and links to it ( solid arrow ) . Next , some of its neighbors are taken as the ambassadors ( eg , y and z ) and the process repeats . ( b ) Butterfly model [ 13 ] forms links only with some fixed probability ( dashed arrows ) . ( c ) In Copying model [ 9 ] , node i links to a and also to some of its neighbors x , y , z ( green nodes ) . ( d ) Proposed Citation model forms links only with the neighbors of the ambassador a ( eg , x and y ) , however , i can still link to a .
Let p be the burning probability , p ∈ [ 0 , 1
2 ) ( see below ) . Initially , the network consists of a single node , while for each newly added node i , the burning process proceeds as follows . ( 1 ) i chooses an ambassador a ∈ N uniformly at random
( we say that i burns a ) and links to it .
( 2 ) i randomly selects ( at most ) xp neighbors of a that were not yet burned a1 , . . . , axp ∈ Γa and links to them . ( xp is sampled from a geometric distribution with mean p 1−p . )
( 3 ) a1 , . . . , axp are taken as the ambassadors of i ( step ( 2) ) . Since each node can be visited at most once , the burning process surely converges . Thus , to generate a network with n nodes , the model repeats the above procedure n− 1 times . Forest Fire model produces shrinking diameters and densification phenomena observed in temporal networks [ 11 ] . Furthermore , generated networks are scale free and smallworld , and reveal a pronounced community structure . However , in contrast to many real world networks , the model gives degree assortative networks ( see Section 3 ) .
The model also has a natural interpretation for citation networks . Burning process imitates an author of a paper including references into the bibliography ( ie , citation dynamics ) . Author first reads a related paper , or selects the paper that triggered the research , and cites it ( step ( 1) ) . Author then considers its bibliography for other related papers ( step ( 2) ) . Some of these are further considered and also cited , while the author continues as before ( step ( 3) ) . Nevertheless , Forest Fire model fails to reproduce some of the properties of citation networks ( eg , degree mixing ) .
Note that the described process assumes that authors read , or at least consider , all the papers they cite . However , this is indeed not the case [ 17 ] . For example , seminal work on random graphs conducted by Erd¨os and R´enyi [ 4 ] is perhaps among most widely cited papers in network science literature . Although , presumably , only a smaller number of authors have actually read the original paper . As the work is widely discussed elsewhere , most authors have just copied the reference from another paper . On the other hand , authors also do not cite all the papers they read , though related to their work . This can be simply due to space limitations . Nevertheless , a paper can still be read thoroughly , with many of its references further considered and cited .
Examples suggest that the papers that authors read or cite are selected due to two , not necessarily dependent , processes . We thus propose a Citation model that adopts the above burning procedure to traverse the network , while the links are formed according to another independent process .
Let q be the linking probability , q ∈ [ 0 , 1 ) ( see below ) . Initially , the network consists of a single link , while for each newly added node i , the model proceeds as follows . ( 1 ) i chooses an ambassador a ∈ N uniformly at random .
( 2 ) i randomly selects ( at most ) xp neighbors of a that were not yet burned a1 , . . . , axp ∈ Γa .
( 3 ) i randomly selects ( at most ) xq neighbors of a that were not yet linked j1 , . . . , jxq ∈ Γa and links to them .
( 4 ) a1 , . . . , axp are taken as the ambassadors of i ( step ( 2) ) .
Details are the same as before . Again , the process surely converges , while the entire procedure is repeated n−2 times . Let s be the mean number of burned nodes ( ie , ambasp 1−p ambassadors on each step , thus , sadors ) . A node selects

A node will fail to form any link ( ie , become isolated ) with probability ( 1−q)s . Although isolated nodes are a common property of real world networks , they are often ignored in practice or the network is even reduced to the largest connected component . Thus , for the analysis here , we repeat the procedure until the largest component has n nodes . q 1−q links on each step , expected network degree is ( with 1−(1 − q)s correction for isolated nodes )

Although equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are only valid in the limit of large network size , the bounds are rather tight for large enough n ( see Figure 3 ) . Thus , given network degree k and fixed q , one can solve the system for p , which can be used for parameter estimation in practice ( see Section 32 )
Citation model generates small world networks with scalefree degree distribution and community structure ( see Section 31 ) Furthermore , in contrast to Forest Fire model , resulting networks are degree disassortative . We stress that the key factor here is that newly added nodes do not ( necessarily ) link to their ambassadors , which in fact produces degree assortativity . Since a node copies the links of its ambassadors , linking to them obviously promotes assortativity . However , in the absence of an explicit process introducing assortativity , ( scale free ) networks are expected to be degree disassortative [ 8 ] . The analysis in Section 3 thus also includes a variant of Forest Fire model denoted Butterfly model , where a node links to its ambassadors only with probability q ( considered in [ 13] ) , as well as a variant of the proposed Citation model denoted Copying model , where a node links to each ambassador [ 9 ] ( for details see Figure 2 ) .
Other authors have proposed models very similar to ours [ 21 ,
9 , 11 , 13 , 24 ] . Nevertheless , these either do not adopt the burning process to traverse the network or the model necessarily links the nodes to their ambassadors , which results in degree assortativity . More precisely , the set of the linked nodes is always a subset of the nodes burned ( or vice versa ) . However , in the case of Citation model , these two sets can intersect arbitrarily , while they can also be disjoint .
3 . EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
Section 3.1 conducts an empirical analysis of Citation model and several alternatives proposed in the literature ( see Section 2 ) . Next , networks constructed with different models are compared against a larger citation network ( Section 32 ) 3.1 Analysis of the model
Figure 4 shows basic statistics of the networks generated with different graph models for parameters p and q shown ( see Section 2 ) . Most notably , only the proposed Citation model gives degree disassortative networks measured by the mixing coefficient r ∈ [ −1 , 1 ] [ 14 ] ( see Figures 4(b ) and 4(g) ) . r is simply a Pearson correlation coefficient of degrees at links’ ends . Thus , r 0 for Citation model , while r * 0 for Forest Fire and Butterfly models . Observe that Copying model also generates networks with r < 0 for very large p and q , however , these are much denser than comparable real world networks ( see Figures 4(a ) and 4(f) ) .
On the other hand , all models give small world networks with short mean distance between the nodes l [ 1 ] ( see Figures 4(c ) and 4(h ) ) and high transitivity measured by the clustering coefficient C ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] [ 23 ] ( see Figures 4(d ) and 4(i) ) . Note that C increases with p , while q has little effect on C . Furthermore , all models generate networks with clear community structure according to modularity Q ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] [ 15 ] , where Q is estimated using a fast multi stage optimization [ 3 ] ( see Figures 4(e ) and 4(j) ) . Although Q decreases with increasing p or q in the case of Citation and Copying models , the values are somewhat comparable to those observed in real world networks . Forest Fire and Butterfly models , however , appear to overestimate Q for selected p and q .
Networks constructed with Citation model also reveal scalefree degree distributions [ 2 ] ( see Figure 5(a) ) , thus , the model generates most common properties of real world networks . 3.2 Cora citation network
Due to a natural interpretation for citation networks ( see Section 2 ) , the proposed model has different practical applications in bibliometrics . We here analyze author citation dynamics based on the famous Cora dataset [ 12 ] that contains computer science papers collected from the web , and also the references automatically parsed from the bibliogra

We extract a citation network with n = 23166 , while other statistics are reported in Table 1 .
Table 1 also includes the networks generated with Citation and Forest Fire models , where parameters p and q were estimated as described in Section 2 . Note that Citation model well matches the disassortative mixing regime in Cora citation network ( observe also a similar trend in Figure 5(b) ) , while Forest Fire model gives degree assortative networks . ( For comparison based on other network properties see [ 19] . ) Recall that s in equation ( 1 ) can be seen as the number references actually read by an author of some paper . Thus , the fraction of papers considered by the authors , relative to the number of all papers cited , can be estimated to 2s/k = 066 The value is much larger than expected [ 17 ] , however , the results are largely influenced by an automatic sampling procedure [ 12 ] ( ie , on average , only k/2 = 3.85 references of each paper are also included in the network ) .
4 . CONCLUSION
The paper proposes a simple graph model that generates networks with most common properties of real world networks and , in contrast to many other models , dissasortative degree mixing . The model also has a natural interpretation for citation networks with different practical applications .
Due to simplicity , the analysis in the paper is based on undirected networks . However , this presents a serious limitation , especially for citation networks considered here . Future work will extend the analysis to directed and also other types of networks , while more reliable datasets will be used for the analysis of author citation dynamics ( based on DBLP and WoS data ) . Furthermore , the model will be rigorously compared against others with similar characteristics [ 20 ] .
