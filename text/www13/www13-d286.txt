ABSTRACT Watching online videos is part of the daily routine of a considerable fraction of Internet users nowadays . Understanding the patterns of access to these videos is paramount for improving the capacity planning for video providers , the conversion rate for advertisers , and the relevance of the whole online video watching experience for end users . While much research has been conducted to analyze video access patterns in user generated content ( UGC ) , little is known of how such patterns manifest in mainstream media ( MSM ) portals . In this paper , we perform the first large scale analysis of video access patterns in MSM portals . As a case study , we analyze interaction logs across a total of 38 Brazilian MSM portals , including six of the largest portals in the country , over a period of eight weeks . Our analysis reveals interesting static and temporal video access patterns in MSM portals , which we compare and contrast to the access patterns reported for UGC websites . Overall , our analysis provides several insights for an improved understanding of video access on the Internet beyond UGC websites .

INTRODUCTION
Online video is changing the way people interact and collaborate on the Web . Today , users can easily share a highquality video directly from any Internet enabled device with millions of viewers . On the other hand , Internet video consumption has risen drastically over the last years . Indeed , a report from June 2010 estimated that 69 % of all Internet users watch or download videos online , while 14 % have posted videos [ 12 ] . Taking advantage of this trend , people have been adopting it in many applications , like product and

For businesses , this presents an opportunity to make information sharing more attractive and to reach out to the right audience .
Online video can be classified according to its providers . In particular , mainstream media ( MSM ) comprises videos shared by specialized providers ( like online press , news portals , and entertainment portals ) in their own website . In turn , user generated content ( UGC ) includes videos shared by Internet users usually through video sharing websites or social media , such as YouTube1 and Vimeo.2 Much research has been devoted to analyzing the patterns of interaction between users and the videos posted in UGC websites ( eg , [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 14] ) . In particular , UGC videos are known to be typically short and biased towards categories such as “ Music ” and “ Comedy ” [ 5 ] . On the other hand , little is known about video access patterns in MSM portals , primarily since detailed interaction logs from such portals are not generally available or are restricted to a few players in the online video sharing market , such as content distributors .
In this paper , we present an analysis of access patterns in Brazilian MSM portals , collected in association with the largest online video distribution platform in Latin America . Brazil is one of the 10 largest online video markets worldwide . Brazilian online viewing audience reached 43 million unique viewers in December 2012.3 In addition , the online video penetration in Brazil peaked at 82 % of its Internet users . Despite the increasing figures , there is still margin for growth as video penetration is slightly below the worldwide average of nearly 84 % .
Our analysis is based on aggregate data from a total of 38 Brazilian MSM portals , including six of the largest portals in the country , and reveals interesting static and temporal access patterns . Regarding static patterns , in line with previous research , we observe that the distribution of views per video presents a truncated long tail , indicating a lower thanexpected amount of unpopular videos . In contrast , MSM portals typically have much longer videos than UGC websites . In addition , the most popular video categories in UGC websites— “ Music ” and “ Comedy ” —are not as dominant in MSM portals . Regarding temporal patterns , we observed cyclic hourly and daily access patterns to MSM videos over our considered 8 week time frame . We also noted the preva

1085 lence of very low values for video retention . Finally , studying how views evolve over time , we concluded that the average video life span depends on the video category but , in general , it is very short .
Thus , the main contributions of this paper are :
1 . A thorough characterization of static and temporal video access patterns in major MSM portals ;
2 . A comparison of the observed patterns with those pre viously reported for UGC video sharing websites .
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows .
In Section 2 , we overview the related literature on the analysis of online video sharing . In Section 3 , we discuss the methodology underlying the analysis conducted in Section 4 . Finally , in Section 5 , we present our concluding remarks and provide some directions for future work .
2 . RELATED WORK
The work presented in this paper relates to a broad spectrum of research on online video sharing , ranging from network traffic characterization for capacity planning at a lower level ( eg , [ 8 , 9 , 13 , 15 ] ) to social network analysis at a higher level ( eg , [ 2 , 3 , 6 , 7 , 11 , 14] ) . Specifically , our work can be better placed somewhere in between these two extremes , by focusing on the characterization of video access patterns at the application ( as opposed to the network ) level .
Acharya et al . [ 1 ] were among the first to analyze video access patterns on the Web , in a period when online video watching was not as widespread as it is today . In particular , they analyzed the access patterns to 139 videos from a small scale experiment in a Swedish university over a 6month period between 1997 and 1998 . As a result of this analysis , they observed cyclic access patterns , with the video watching activity dropping during weekends compared to weekdays . They also observed a temporal locality in the access patterns , and a low retention for 45 % of all videos , the majority of which being stopped after only 5 % of their duration . In Sections 3 and 4 , we conduct a similar temporal analysis , however at a much larger scale , covering millions of videos published by major Brazilian MSM portals .
In recent years , with the emergence of social media on the Web , several studies have been conducted to analyze video access patterns in UGC websites , notably YouTube ( eg , [ 4 , 5] ) . For instance , Cheng et al . [ 5 ] analyzed a 3 month crawl of YouTube from early 2007 , comprising a total of 2.6 million videos , 22.9 % of which falling in the “ Music ” category , the most popular of YouTube ’s 12 defined categories . In their study , they observed that short clips make the majority of videos on YouTube , with 97.8 % of all videos spanning less than 5 minutes . Regarding the distribution of views per video , their analysis showed that it follows a truncated power law rather than a standard Zipf ’s distribution [ 10 ] , indicating a lower than expected amount of unpopular videos ( ie , the long tail ) . In addition , by tracking a total of 43 thousand videos for a period of seven weeks , they observed that a total of 70 % have a decaying popularity growth as time passes , denoting a short life span .
Regarding the comparison of UGC and non UGC content , Cha et al . [ 4 ] performed a large scale analysis of content production on YouTube , in contrast to specialized nonUGC video providers , such as Netflix , LOVEFiLM , and Yahoo! Movies . Their analysis revealed a substantially larger growth rate of content production in UGC compared to nonUGC websites . On the other hand , the distribution of videos per publisher between the two scenarios showed a similar power law behavior , with the exception that the median production of a non UGC publisher ( eg , a movie director ) is naturally capped by the temporal and monetary constraints imposed by the movie industry . Their analysis also showed that the median duration of a UGC video is two orders of magnitude shorter than that of a non UGC video . In this paper , we also analyze video access patterns in non UGC websites . However , to the best of our knowledge , ours is the first analysis focused on general purpose MSM portals as opposed to specialized non UGC video providers . In addition , we analyze both the content production and consumption on MSM portals , as will be discussed in Sections 3 and 4 .
3 . EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY
To understand the behavior of users accessing MSM portals , as a case study , we have analyzed records of Internet users interacting with some of the leading Brazilian MSM portals . The data for our case study was collected in association with Samba Tech.4 Samba Tech is the largest online video platform in Latin America , providing solutions in video management and distribution for customers including large media groups , soccer teams , news websites , educational institutes and e commerce channels in Brazil .
Samba Tech provides to its customers a platform for online video hosting , management , and distribution . Websites using the platform can also adopt Samba Tech ’s embedded player . We have collected user interactions while accessing videos delivered by Samba Tech during a period of 8 weeks , from June to August , 2012 . The data was collected by a script in Samba Tech ’s embedded player . Every user action on the player in a customer ’s web page results in an API call to a server . The server aggregates all events , from different websites , in a database .
For each user accessing a video at a given time , we have logged what we call a session . In particular , a session comprises all user interactions with the player ( eg , play , pause , resume , and video progress ) and general information about the video being watched ( eg , category , publication date , and duration ) . We also converted all access times , originally logged as GMT , to the local time zone . All user data was collected entirely anonymously . The video content and the video provider ’s identity were also anonymized during the collection process .

Table 1 describes the salient statistics of the collected dataset . The dataset includes user interactions recorded continuously over a period of 8 weeks , from June 24th , 2012 ( Sun ) to August 18th , 2012 ( Sat ) , so as to enable the observation of both static as well as temporal factors over a
4http://wwwsambatechcom
1086 long timespan . Moreover , it is noteworthy that the collected dataset comprises the entire log of the user interactions recorded over the duration of this study , as opposed to a sample of it . In particular , the dataset comprises around 110 million sessions , 43 million unique users and 127 thousand unique videos , with a mean duration of around 7 minutes . The relatively high standard deviation of video durations reveals the heterogeneity of the content posted on the considered general purpose MSM portals . As we will show in Section 4.1 , such a high variability is primarily due to the presence of videos from multiple distinct categories .
4 . EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
In this section , we perform a thorough analysis of the interaction logs collected from major Brazilian MSM portals , as described in Section 3 . In particular , this analysis aims to answer the following research questions :
Q1 . Which access patterns emerge from analyzing a static snapshot of MSM portals aggregated over time ?
Q2 . Which temporal patterns can be inferred by analyzing user interactions at different points in time ?
To address these research questions , we perform two broad sets of analyses . In particular , in Section 4.1 , we perform a static analysis of our collected dataset , in which the whole dataset is analyzed in aggregate , regardless of temporal aspects . In Section 4.2 , we complement our static picture of Brazilian MSM portals with a temporal analysis , aimed to investigate user access patterns at different points across the 8 week timespan of our collected dataset .
4.1 Static Analysis
In this section , we address research question Q1 , by analyzing a static snapshot of our 8 week dataset , in order to uncover its salient access patterns . In particular , we analyze the distribution of video access requests in light of various user and video properties , such as category and duration . In addition , we contrast the uncovered patterns to those reported in the literature for users interacting with videos on UGC websites . 411 Video Categories The topical nature of a video is a determinant factor to understand its access patterns . In particular , the videos hosted in the Samba Tech platform can be assigned to one of nine fixed categories . Such an assignment is optionally performed by the video provider when the video is uploaded . Figures 1 and 2 show , respectively , the distribution of videos and views per category in our dataset .
From Figure 1 , we first observe that 53.6 % of all videos ( 68,098 from a total of 127,068 ) have not been assigned to any category . In turn , the categories with the most videos are : “ Politics ” ( 17.1% ) , “ Entertainment ” ( 14.3% ) , “ Sports ” ( 11.1% ) , and “ Science ” ( 23 % ) These categories are also popular in UGC video sharing websites , such as YouTube . On the other hand , while “ Music ” and “ Comedy ” are among the most popular categories on YouTube ( 22.9 % and 12.1 % , respectively ) [ 6 ] , they appear with relatively fewer assignments in our dataset ( less than 1% ) . Arguably , such a discrepancy is justified by the absence of music providers in our dataset and by the presumable preference of UGC users to share music and comedy content . i s o e d v f o r e b m u n s w e v i

Figure 2 : Number of views per category .
T
From Figure 2 , we observe that the number of views per category does not necessarily correspond to the number of videos per category . Indeed , the category with the most videos , “ Politics ” , received less views than categories such as “ Entertainment ” and “ Sports ” . “ Entertainment ” was the category with the most views overall ( 35.9% ) , arguably because videos from this category usually have a strong “ viral effect ” , tending to be more shared . Considering the ratio of views per video , the categories “ Music ” and “ People ” stand out from the others with 11,536.59 and 7,202.93 , respectively .
412 Video Duration Statistics reported for YouTube have shown that it is mostly comprised of short video clips ( 20.6 % of the videos have less than one minute of duration and 17.1 % have 3 to 4 minutes ) [ 6 ] . In contrast , as previously shown in Table 1 , the mean video duration in our entire dataset is 433.5s , ie , just above 7 minutes . Moreover , the mean duration of a video is closely related to its category , as shown in Figure 3 . In the figure , mean duration is expressed in seconds , with error bars denoting a 95 % confidence interval for the mean . From Figure 3 , we observe that videos from the “ Pets ” category and those without an assigned category have the longest duration ( over 600s ) compared to videos in other categories . “ Entertainment ” and “ Politics ” have also a long mean duration , probably because most of the videos in these categories are short documentaries , reports , or parts of entire TV shows . In contrast , “ Comedy ” , “ Music ” , and “ Sports ” comprise much shorter videos on average , corresponding to short news reports , ads , or music clips . The predominance

T of short videos in these categories also resembles the scenario observed with YouTube , where these categories are among the most popular ones [ 6 ] . 413 Views There is no authentication requirement for most users accessing videos in the analyzed MSM portals . However , we can still keep track of which videos have been watched by a user over a period of time by resorting to cookies . Based upon this tracked data , Figure 4 shows the complementary cumulative distribution function ( CCDF ) of the number of views per user in our dataset .

Figure 4 : Number of views per user ( CCDF ) .
From Figure 4 , we observe that all users watched at least one video ( ie , the x and y axes start from 1 ) . The CCDF distribution reveals a long tail of users that watched a small number of videos , whereas a small fraction of users watched substantially more videos . Indeed , less then 10 % of the users watched at least ten videos and much less than 1 % watched at least one hundred videos . Complementary to this observation , Figure 5 shows the CCDF of the number of views per video .
From Figure 5 , we observe a less steep distribution , where more than 10 % of all videos received at least one hundred views . In contrast , much fewer videos received more than a thousand views . While also showing a long tail of modestly watched videos , this distribution does not follow Zipf ’s

In light of research question Q1 , on the access patterns derived from a static snapshot of our 8 week dataset , the analysis in this section reveals an interesting parallel with previous studies on video access patterns in UGC websites , most notably YouTube . In particular , regarding the popularity of video categories , we observed a distinguishingly lower prevalence of “ Music ” and “ Comedy ” videos in the analyzed MSM portals , the two most popular categories in YouTube [ 6 ] . We have also observed that the average video length in these MSM portals depends heavily on the video category , whereas the majority of YouTube videos is relatively much shorter , regardless of their category . Finally , in line with previous research [ 1 , 6 ] , we have observed a truncated long tail in the distribution of views per video , which does not follow Zipf ’s law .
4.2 Temporal Analysis
In the previous section , we analyzed our entire dataset In this secin aggregate , considering only static aspects . tion , we seek to answer research question Q2 , by focusing on the analysis of access patterns over time . In particular , our analysis comprises three broad dimensions : the evolution of access patterns , video retention , and video life span . Note that this analysis is only made possible because of the large time frame covered by our collected dataset . 421 Access Patterns The frequency and time when users watch videos online may vary according to their particular daily routine . Indeed , it is possible to uncover some common temporal access patterns by analyzing our interaction data over time . For instance , Figure 6 shows the number of views ( accesses ) per day over the entire analyzed interval of 8 weeks ( 56 days ) . The first day in the interval ( June 24th , 2012 ) is a Sunday , whereas the last day ( August 18th , 2012 ) is a Saturday . The mean number of views per day in the period is 1,848,972.21 , with extreme values of 1,094,646 and 2,416,967 .
From Figure 6 , we first observe that there is a clear cyclic pattern of accesses to MSM videos . In particular , for the analyzed interval , the number of views during weekdays is almost twice as much as the daily views during weekends . We

Figure 6 : Number of views per day over 8 weeks . can also observe that , with the exception of July 28th and 29th , more videos were viewed on Saturdays than on Sundays . Actually , Sunday is the day with the smallest average number of views during the week ( 1370790,87 ) , whereas Thursday is the day with the largest average ( 2087578,37 ) To better understand access patterns over time , we have further analyzed the distribution of views at a finer granularity . To this end , Figure 7 shows the number of views per hour of the day . While we have analyzed the distribution for the entire dataset ( 8 weeks ) , for the sake of clarity , we show the results for a 7 day period between July 15th ( Sunday ) and 21st ( Saturday ) , which represents a typical week in our dataset , with the other weeks showing a similar behavior .
From Figure 7 , we observe that the distribution of views per hour of the day follows an expected and well defined pattern . In particular , there is an accelerated rise in views from 7am to 12am . Then the number of views grows slowly , presenting some peaks and troughs . The highest peak usually occurs between 7pm and 8pm . After that , accesses decline quickly until about 6am , when they reach the lowest value . This pattern of access is observed invariably in other days . Figure 8 shows the distribution of views per hour of the day for the four most popular categories . We can see that the common pattern shown in Figure 7 is also observed in the distributions of individual categories . However , it is possible to infer some specific patterns . For example , for category “ Sports ” , the number of views is much higher on Monday and Thursday than on the other days of the week . This can be explained by the fact that the main soccer games in Brazil occur on Sunday and Wednesday , which result in more views on the immediately following days .
422 Retention The number of accesses a video has received reflects its popularity , but not necessarily how much a user liked it . To estimate the video rating for a user , we calculate the video retention as the time a user spends watching the video divided by the video duration . We use the session time—ie , the time difference between the last logged session event and the first one—as an approximation of viewing time . Figure 9 shows the CCDF of retention values for all sessions . From the figure , we observe that only about 25 % of all sessions have a retention greater than 01 In other words , most users watch less than 10 % of the content of each video .

Figure 8 : Number of views per hour of the day and category over 7 days . than 20 % of sessions with 0.1 of retention , while category “ Entertainment ” has almost 30 % of sessions with at least 10 % of retention . 423 Life Span In Section 413 , we analyzed the distribution of views aggregated over the whole interval of 8 weeks comprised by our dataset . In that analysis , only the total views received by a video ( or the total views granted by a user ) were considered . In this section , we examine how this amount of views is distributed over time .
To understand the evolution of views , it is necessary to track the accesses received by videos since their publication . To this end , we consider only videos that have been published in the first week of our collection ( from June 24th to 30th ) , and track the number of views of these videos daily from the day of publication until the last day of our data collection ( August 18th ) . Figure 11 shows the life span distribution ( CDF ) of these videos , measured in terms of the number of views received per day since the publication of each video .
From Figure 11 , we observe that about 37 % of the views received by a video occur within the same day of its publication ( represented by 0 on the x axis ) , 67 % occur until the end of the first day of publication , 85 % are achieved before the 5th day , and 90 % are achieved before the 9th day . Clearly , the evolution of views follows a logarithmic function . Most

Figure 11 : Video life span ( CDF ) . views occur as soon as a video is published , while less views are received on the subsequent days over a few weeks . In addition , only very few videos continue to be watched after one month of their publication , which indicates that the life span of MSM videos is usually very short .
A breakdown of the results in Figure 11 across the four most representative categories is shown in Figure 12 , which

Figure 13 : Video life span per category ( CDF ) over the first week .
From Figures 12 and 13 , we observe the same logarithmic pattern exhibited in Figure 11 . However , the most distinguishing difference is the convergence rate . In particular , about 77 % of the views for videos from the category “ Sports ” occur on the first day of their publication , whereas videos from the category “ Science ” achieve only about 29 % of the views in the same period . In fact , it takes almost 16 days for videos from the category “ Science ” to reach 77 % of their total views .
In light of research question Q2 , we have analyzed several video access patterns emerging over the time frame covered by our dataset . By analyzing views by day , we have observed that there is a cyclic access pattern and that the number of views during weekdays is much greater than during the weekends . A cyclic pattern also occurs in the daily distribution of views . We have also noted that the video retention varies slightly between categories but , in general , it takes low values for most users . Analyzing how views evolve over time , we conclude , as already reported by Cheng et al . [ 5 ] for YouTube videos , that the video life span is usually very short , with videos from some categories receiving most of their views on the first day after publication , while videos from other categories usually taking longer to reach the same percentage of their total accesses . Lastly , video providers can use this information to estimate how often content has to be released or to predict access statistics . It is also important to consider the differences between categories in how views evolve after a video publication .
5 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper , we have presented an extensive analysis of video access patterns in mainstream media ( MSM ) portals . Due to the limited availability of public data , little is known regarding access patterns to MSM videos . However , using data collected in association with Samba Tech , we could have a privileged perspective of user interactions while accessing some of the largest Brazilian MSM portals . In our analysis , we aimed to investigate which access patterns could be identified by considering a static snapshot of the collection and which temporal patterns could be inferred by observing user interactions over time .
Our static analysis revealed interesting patterns that can be compared with previous studies on video access patterns in UGC websites . We observed that the two most popular categories in YouTube are among the least prevalent in MSM portals . We have also noted that the average video duration in MSM portals depends heavily on the video category and that YouTube videos are relatively much shorter than MSM ones . Analyzing the distribution of views per video , we have observed a truncated long tail , which does not follow Zipf ’s law . Investigating the access to MSM videos over time , we have found some recurring patterns . In particular , a cyclic access pattern was observed by analyzing how views evolve by hour and by day . We have also noted the prevalence of very low values for video retention . Finally , studying how views evolve over time , we have concluded that video life span depends on video category but , in general , it is very short .
The access patterns revealed by static and temporal analyses have a broad applicability and can be used by MSM portals to improve service quality and enhance users’ experience . The static investigation has brought general information about user behavior and preferences . The temporal analysis , on the other hand , may allow providers to better know when to publish and replace a given content . It is also possible to use this information to estimate users’ reaction after content publishing . In fact , there are many applications that may benefit from our results , such as contenttargeted advertising , recommendation , service personalization , etc . As future work , we plan to expand our analysis to investigate social aspects of MSM portals , such as how the users of such portals relate to one another , in terms of the similarity of their access patterns .
