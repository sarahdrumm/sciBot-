ABSTRACT Web search is an integral part of our daily lives . Recently , there has been a trend of personalization in Web search , where different users receive different results for the same search query . The increasing personalization is leading to concerns about Filter Bubble effects , where certain users are simply unable to access information that the search engines’ algorithm decides is irrelevant . Despite these concerns , there has been little quantification of the extent of personalization in Web search today , or the user attributes that cause it .
In light of this situation , we make three contributions . First , we develop a methodology for measuring personalization in Web search results . While conceptually simple , there are numerous details that our methodology must handle in order to accurately attribute differences in search results to personalization . Second , we apply our methodology to 200 users on Google Web Search ; we find that , on average , 11.7 % of results show differences due to personalization , but that this varies widely by search query and by result ranking . Third , we investigate the causes of personalization on Google Web Search . Surprisingly , we only find measurable personalization as a result of searching with a logged in account and the IP address of the searching user . Our results are a first step towards understanding the extent and effects of personalization on Web search engines today .

INTRODUCTION
Web search services like Bing and Google Web Search ( Google Search ) are an integral part of our daily lives ; Google Search alone receives 17 billion queries per month from US users [ 52 ] . People use Web search for a number of reasons , including finding authoritative sources on a topic ,

The search results that are returned , and their order , have significant implications : ranking certain results higher or lower can dramatically affect business outcomes ( eg , the popularity of search engine optimization services ) , political elections ( eg , US Senator Rick Santorum ’s battle with Google [ 18] ) , and foreign affairs ( eg , Google ’s ongoing conflict with Chinese Web censors [ 46] ) .
Recently , major search engines have implemented personalization , where different users searching for the same terms may observe different results [ 1 , 34 ] . For example , users searching for “ pizza ” in New York and in Boston may receive different , but locally relevant restaurant results . Personalization provides obvious benefits to users , including disambiguation and retrieval of locally relevant results .
However , personalization of Web search has led to growing concerns over the Filter Bubble effect [ 9 ] , where users are only given results that the personalization algorithm thinks they want ( while other , potentially important , results remain hidden ) . For example , Eli Pariser demonstrated that during the recent Egyptian revolution , different users searching for “ Tahrir Square ” received either links to news reports of protests , or links to travel agencies [ 26 ] . The Filter Bubble effect is exacerbated by the dual issues that most users do not know that search results are personalized , yet users tend to place blind faith in the quality of search results [ 25 ] . Concerns about the Filter Bubble effects are now appearing in the popular press [ 35 , 38 ] , driving growth in the popularity of alternative search engines that do not personalize results ( eg , duckduckgocom ) Unfortunately , to date , there has been little scientific quantification of the basis and extent of search personalization in practice .
In this paper , we make three contributions towards remedying this situation . First , we develop a methodology for measuring personalization in Web search results . Measuring personalization is conceptually simple : one can run multiple searches for the same queries and compare the results . However , accurately attributing differences in returned search results to personalization requires accounting for a number of phenomena , including temporal changes in the search index , consistency issues in distributed search indices , and A/B tests being run by the search provider . We develop a methodology that is able to control for these phenomena and create a command line based implementation that we make available to the research community .
Second , we use this methodology to measure the extent of personalization on Google Web Search today . We recruit 200 users with active Google accounts from Amazon ’s Mechanical Turk to run a list of Web searches , and we measure the differences in search results that they are given . We control for differences in time , location , distributed infrastructure , and noise , allowing us to attribute any differences observed to personalization . Although our results are only a lower bound , we observe significant personalization : on average , 11.7 % of search results show differences due to personalization , with higher probabilities for results towards the bottom . We see the highest personalization for queries related to political issues , news , and local businesses .
Third , we investigate the causes of personalization , covering user provided profile information , Web browser and operating system choice , search history , search result click history , and browsing history . We create numerous Google accounts and assign each a set of unique behaviors . We develop a standard list of 120 search queries that cover a variety of topics pulled from Google Zeitgeist [ 14 ] and WebMD [ 48 ] . We then measure the differences in results that are returned for this list of searches . Overall , we find that while the level of personalization is significant , there are very few user properties that lead to personalization . Contrary to our expectations , we find that only being logged in to Google and the location ( IP address ) of the user ’s machine result in measurable personalization . All other attributes do not result in level of personalization beyond the baseline noise level .
We view our work as a first step towards measuring and addressing the increasing level of personalization on the Web today . All Web search engines periodically introduce new techniques , thus any particular findings about the level and causes of personalization may only be accurate for a small time window . However , our methodology can be applied periodically to determine if search services have changed . Additionally , although we focus on Google Search in this paper , our methodology naturally generalizes to other search services as well ( eg , Bing , Google News ) .
2 . BACKGROUND
We now provide background on Google Search and overview the terminology used in the remainder of the paper .
2.1 A Brief History of Google
Personalization on Google Search . Google first introduced “ Personalized Search ” in 2004 [ 17 ] , and merged this product into Google Search in 2005 [ 1 ] . In 2009 , Google began personalizing search results for all users , even those without Google accounts [ 15 ] . Recently , Google started including personalized content from the Google+ social network into search results [ 33 ] . For example , users may see Web pages which were shared or “ +1’d ” by people in their Google+ circles alongside normal Google search results .
There is very little concrete information about how Google personalizes search results . A 2011 post on the official Google blog states that Google Search personalizes results based on the user ’s language , geolocation , history of search queries , and their Google+ social connections [ 32 ] . However , the specific uses of search history data are unclear : the blog post suggests that the temporal order of searches matters , as well as whether users click on results . Similarly , the specific uses of social data from Google+ are unknown . coughs

Google Accounts . As the number and scope of the services provided by Google grew , Google began unifying their account management architecture . Today , Google Accounts are the single point of login for all Google services . Once a user logs in to one of these services , they are effectively logged in to all services . A tracking cookie enables all of Google ’s services to uniquely identify each logged in user . As of May 2012 , Google ’s privacy policy allows betweenservice information sharing across all Google services [ 45 ] .
Advertising and User Tracking . Google is capable of tracking users as they browse the Web due to their large advertising networks . Roesner et al . provide an excellent overview of how Google can use cookies from DoubleClick and Google Analytics , as well as widgets from YouTube and Google+ to track users’ browsing habits [ 31 ] .
2.2 Terminology
In this study , we use a specific set of terms when referring to Google Search . Each query to Google Search is composed of one or more keywords . In response to a query , Google Search returns a page of results . Figure 1 shows a truncated example page of Google Search results for the query “ coughs . ” Each page contains ≈10 results ( in some cases there may be more or less ) . We highlight three results with red boxes in Figure 1 . Most results contain ≥ 1 links . In this study , we only focus on the primary link in each result , which we highlight with red arrows in Figure 1 .
In most cases , the primary link is organic , ie , it points to a third party website . The WebMD result in Figure 1 falls into this category . However , the primary link may point to another Google service . For example , in Figure 1 the “ News for coughs ” link directs to Google News .
A few services inserted in Google Search results do not include a primary link . The Related Searches result in Figure 1 falls into this category . Another example is Google Dictionary , which displays the definition of a search keyword . In these cases , we treat the primary link of the result as a descriptive , static string , eg , “ Related ” or “ Dictionary . ”
3 . METHODOLOGY
In this section , we describe our experimental methodology . First , we give the high level intuition that guides the design of our experiments , and identify sources of noise that can urban outfitters

Figure 2 : Example of result carry over , searching for “ hawaii ” then searching for “ urban outfitters . ” lead to errors in data collection . Second , we describe the implementation of our experiments . Lastly , we introduce the queries we use to test for personalization .
3.1 Experiment Design
Our study seeks to answer two broad questions . First , what user features influence Google ’s search personalization algorithms ? This question is fundamental : outside of Google , nobody knows the specifics of how personalization works . Second , to what extent does search personalization actually affect search results ? Although it is known that Google personalizes search results , it is not clear how much these algorithms actually alter the results . If the delta between “ normal ” and “ personalized ” results is small , then concerns over the Filter Bubble effect may be misguided .
In this paper , we focus on measuring Google Search , as it is the most popular search engine . However , our methodology is Web service agnostic , and could be repeated on other search engines like Bing or Google News Search .
At a high level , our methodology is to execute carefully controlled queries on Google Search to identify what user features trigger personalization . Each experiment follows a similar pattern : first , create x Google accounts that each vary by one specific feature . Second , execute q identical queries from each account , once per day for d days . Save the results of each query . Finally , compare the results of the queries to determine whether the same results are being served in the same order to each account . If the results vary between accounts , then the changes can be attributed to personalization linked to the given experimental feature . Note that we run some experimental treatments without Google accounts ( eg , to simulate users without Google accounts ) .
Sources of Noise . Despite the simplicity of the highlevel experimental design , there are several sources of noise that can cause identical queries to return different results .
• Updates to the Search Index : Web search services constantly update their search indices . This means that the results for a query may change over time .
• Distributed Infrastructure :
Large scale Web search services are spread across geographically diverse datacenters . Our tests have shown that different datacenters may return different results for the same queries . It is likely that these differences arise due to inconsistencies in the search index across datacenters . • Geolocation : Search engines use the user ’s IP ad x e d n

Time Between Subsequent Searches ( Minutes )
Figure 3 : Overlap of results when searching for “ test ” followed by “ touring ” compared to just “ touring ” for different waiting periods . dress to provide localized results [ 51 ] . Thus , searches from different subnets may receive different results .
• A/B Testing : Web search services sometimes conduct A/B testing [ 24 ] , where certain results are altered to measure whether users click on them more often . Thus , there may be a certain level of noise independent of all other factors .
The Carry Over Effect . One particular source of noise comes from the influence of one search on subsequent searches . In other words , if a user searches for query A , and then searches for query B , the results for B may be influenced by the previous search for A . We term this phenomenon the carry over effect . Prior research on user intent while searching has shown that sequential queries from a user are useful for refining search results [ 5 , 40 ] , so it is not surprising that Google Search leverages this feature .
An example of carry over is shown in Figure 2 .
In this test , we search for “ hawaii ” and then immediately search for “ urban outfitters ” ( a clothing retailer ) . We conducted the searches from a Boston IP address , so the results include links to the Urban Outfitters store in Boston . However , because the previous query was “ hawaii , ” results pertaining to Urban Outfitters in Hawai’i are also shown .
To determine how close in time search queries must be to trigger carry over , we conduct a simple experiment . We first pick different pairs of queries ( eg , “ gay marriage ” and “ obama ” ) . We then start two different browser instances : in one we search for the first query , wait , and then for the second query , while in the other we search only for the second query . We repeat this experiment with different wait times , and re run the experiment 50 times with different query pairs . Finally , we compare the results returned in the two different browser instances for the second term .
The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 3 for the terms “ test ” and “ touring ” ( other pairs of queries show similar results ) . The carry over effect can be clearly observed : the results share , on average , seven common results ( out of 10 ) when the interval between the searches is less than 10 minutes ( in this case , results pertaining to Turing Tests are included ) . After 10 minutes , the carry over effect disappears . Thus , in all experiments in the following sections , we wait at least 11 minutes between subsequent searches in order to avoid any carry over effects . In our testing , we observed carry over for both logged in users and users without Google accounts .
Controlling Against Noise . In order to mitigate measurements errors due to these factors , we perform a num ber of steps ( some borrowed from [ 10] ) : First , all of our queries are executed by the normal Google Search webpage , rather than Google ’s Search API . It has been shown that search engine APIs sometimes return different results than the standard webpage [ 4 ] . Second , all of our machines execute searches for the same query at the same time ( ie , in lock step ) . This eliminates differences is query results due to temporal effects . This also means that each of our Google accounts has exactly the same search history at the same time . Third , we use static DNS entries to direct all of our query traffic to a specific Google IP address . This eliminates errors arising from differences between datacenters . Fourth , we wait 11 minutes in between subsequent queries to avoid carry over . As shown in Figure 3 , an 11 minute wait is sufficient to avoid the majority of instances of carry over . Fifth , unless otherwise stated , we send all of the search queries for a given experiment from the same /24 subnet . Doing so ensures that any geolocation would affect all results equally . Sixth , we include a control account in each of our experiments . The control account is configured in an identical manner to one other account in the given experiment ( essentially , we run one of the experimental treatments twice ) . By comparing the results received by the control and its duplicate , we can determine the baseline level of noise in the experiment ( eg , noise caused by A/B testing ) . Intuitively , the control should receive exactly the same search results as its duplicate because they are configured identically , and perform the same actions at the same time . If there is divergence between their results , it must be due to noise .
3.2 Implementation
Our experiments are implemented using custom scripts for PhantomJS [ 28 ] . We chose PhantomJS because it is a full implementation of the WebKit browser , meaning that it executes JavaScript , manages cookies , etc . Thus , using PhantomJS is significantly more realistic than using custom code that does not execute JavaScript , and it is more scalable than automating a full Web browser ( eg , Selenium [ 42] ) .
On start , each PhantomJS instance logs in to Google using a separate Google account , and begins issuing queries to Google Search . The script downloads the first page of search results for each query . The script waits 11 minutes in between searches for subsequent queries .
During execution , each PhantomJS instance remains persistent in memory and stores all received cookies . After executing all assigned queries , each PhantomJS instance closes and its cookies are cleared . The Google cookies are recreated during the next invocation of the experiment when the script logs in to its assigned Google account . All of our experiments are designed to complete in ≈24 hours .
All instances of PhantomJS are run on a single machine . We modified the /etc/hosts file of this machine so that Google DNS queries resolve to a specific Google IP address . We use SSH tunnels to forward traffic from each PhantomJS instance to a unique IP address in the same /24 subnet .
All of our experiments were conducted in fall of 2012 . Although our results are representative for this time period , they may not hold in the future , since Google is constantly tweaking their personalization algorithms .

Table 1 : Categories of search queries used in our experiments .
Windows 7 . As shown in Section 5.2 , we do not observe any personalization of results based on these attributes .
We manually crafted each of our Google accounts to minimize the likelihood of Google automatically detecting them . Each account was given a unique name and profile image . We read all of the introductory emails in each account ’s Gmail inbox , and looked at any pending Google+ notifications . To the best of our knowledge , none of our accounts were banned or flagged by Google during our experiments .
3.3 Search Queries
In our experiments , each Google account searches for a specific list of queries . It is fundamental to our research that we select a list of queries that has both breadth and impact . Breadth is vital , since we do not know which queries Google personalizes results for . However , given that we cannot test all possible queries , it is important that we select queries that real people are likely to use .
As shown in Table 1 , we use 120 queries divided equally over 12 categories in our experiments . These queries were chosen from the 2011 Google Zeitgeist [ 14 ] , and WebMD [ 48 ] . Google Zeitgeist is published annually by Google , and highlights the most popular search queries from the previous calendar year . We chose these queries for two reasons : first , they cover a broad range of categories ( breadth ) . Second , these queries are popular by definition , ie , they are guaranteed to impact a large number of people .
The queries from Google Zeitgeist cover many important areas . 10 queries are political ( eg , “ Obama Jobs Plan ” , “ 2012 Republican Candidates ” ) and 10 are related to news sources ( eg , “ USA Today News ” ) . Personalization of political and news related searches are some of the most contentious issues raised in Eli Pariser ’s book on the Filter Bubble effects [ 26 ] . Furthermore , several categories are shopping related ( eg , gadgets , apparel brands , travel destination ) . As demonstrated by Orbitz , shopping related searches are prime targets for personalization [ 21 ] .
One critical area that is not covered by Google Zeitgeist is health related queries . To fill this gap , we chose ten random queries from WebMD ’s list of popular health topics [ 48 ] .
4 . REAL WORLD PERSONALIZATION
We begin by measuring the extent of personalization that users are seeing today . Doing so requires obtaining access to the search results observed by real users ; we therefore conducted a simple user study .
4.1 Collecting Real World Data
Google Accounts . Unless otherwise specified , each Google account we create has the same profile : 27 year old , female . The default User Agent we use is Chrome 22 on

Table 2 : Top 10 most/least personalized queries .
States , 2 ) have a Google account , and 3 ) be logged in to Google during the study.1 Users who accepted the task were instructed to configure their Web browser to use a HTTP proxy controlled by us . Then , the users were directed to visit a Web page that automatically performed 80 Google searches . 50 of the queries were randomly chosen from the categories in Table 1 , while 30 were chosen by us .
The HTTP proxy serves several functions . First , the proxy records Google Search ’s HTML responses to the users’ queries . Second , each time the proxy observes a user making a query , it executes two PhantomJS scripts . Each script logs in to Google and executes the same exact query as the user . The results served to the scripts act as the control , allowing us to compare results from a real user ( who Google has collected extensive data on ) to fresh accounts ( that have minimal Google history ) . Third , the proxy controls for noise in two ways : 1 ) by executing user queries and the corresponding scripted queries in parallel , and 2 ) forwarding all Google Search traffic to a hard coded Google IP address .
Although the proxy is necessary to control for noise , there is a caveat to this technique . Queries from AMT users must be sent to http://google.com , whereas the controls use https://googlecom The reason for this issue is that HTTPS Google Search rejects requests from proxies , since they could indicate a man in the middle attack . Unfortunately , result pages from HTTP Google Search include a disclaimer explaining that some types of search personalization are disabled for HTTP results . Thus , our results from AMT users should be viewed as a lower bound on possible personalization .
AMT Worker Demographics . In total , we recruited 200 AMT workers , each of whom answered a brief demographic survey . Our participants self reported to residing in 43 different US states , and range in age from 12 to >48 ( with a bias towards younger users ) . Figure 4 shows the usage of Google services by our participants : 84 % are Gmail users , followed by 76 % that use Google Maps . These survey results demonstrate that our participants 1 ) come from a broad sample of the US population , and 2 ) use a wide variety of Google services .
4.2 Results
We now pose the question : how often do real users receive personalized search results ? To answer this question , we compare the results received by AMT users and the corresponding control accounts . Figure 5 shows the percentage of results that differ at each rank ( ie , result 1 , result 2 , etc . ) when we compare the AMT results to the control results , and the control results to each other . Intuitively , the percent change between the controls is the noise floor ; any change above the noise floor when comparing AMT results to the control can be attributed to personalization .
There are two takeaways from Figure 5 . First , we observe extensive personalization of search results . On average , across all ranks , AMT results showed an 11.7 % higher likelihood of differing from the control result than the controls results did from each other . This additional difference can be attributed to personalization . Second , top ranks tend to be less personalized than bottom ranks .
To better understand how personalization varies across queries , we list the top 10 most and least personalized queries in Table 2 . The level of personalization per query is calculated as the probability of AMT results equaling the control results , minus the probability of the control results equaling each other . Large values for this quantity indicate large divergence between AMT and control results , as well as low noise ( ie , low control/control divergence ) .
As shown in Table 2 , the most personalized queries tend to be related to companies and politics ( eg , “ greece ” , “ human rights ” or “ home depot ” ) . Digging into the individual results , we observe a great deal of personalization based on location . Even though all of the AMT users’ requests went through our proxy and thus appeared to Google as being from the same IP address , Google Search returned results that are specific to other locations . This was especially common for company names , where AMT users received different store locations . In contrast , the least personalized results in Table 2 tend to be factual and health related queries .
5 . PERSONALIZATION FEATURES
In the previous section , we observed personalization for real users on Google Search . We now examine which user features Google Search uses to personalize results . Although we cannot possibly enumerate and test all possible features , we can investigate likely candidates . Table 3 lists the different demographic profiles that our experiments emulate during experiments .
5.1 Measuring Personalization

When comparing the list of search results for test and control accounts , we use two metrics to measure personalization . First , we use Jaccard Index , which views the result d r a c c a J

To measure reordering , we use edit distance . To calculate edit distance , we compute the number of list elements that must be inserted , deleted , substituted , or swapped ( ie , the Damerau Levenshtein distance [ 7 ] ) to make the test list identical to the control list . For example , if the test account receives the result list [ a.com , b.com , c.com ] and the control receives the list [ c.com , b.com ] for the same query , then the edit distance is 2 ( one insertion and one swap ) .
5.2 Basic Features
We begin our experiments by focusing on features associated with a user ’s browser , their physical location , and their Google profile . For each experiment , we create x + 1 fresh Google accounts , where x equals the number of possible values of the feature we are testing in that experiment , plus one additional control account . For example , in the Gender experiment , we create 4 accounts : one “ male , ” one “ female , ” one “ other , ” and one additional “ female ” as a control . We execute x + 1 instances of our PhantomJS script for each experiment , and forward the traffic to x + 1 unique endpoints via SSH tunnels . Each account searches for all 120 of our queries , and we repeat this process daily for seven days .
Basic Cookie Tracking . In this experiment , the goal is to compare the search results for users who are logged in to a Google account , not logged in to Google , and who do not support cookies at all . Google is able to track the logged in and logged out users , since Google Search places track

Table 3 : User features evaluated for effects on search personalization . ing cookies on all users , even if they do not have a Google account . The user who does not support cookies receives a new tracking cookie after every request to Google , and we confirm that the identifiers in these cookies are unique on every request . However , it is unknown whether Google is able to link these new identifiers together behind the scenes ( eg , by using the user ’s IP address as a unique identifier ) . To conduct this experiment , we use four instances of PhantomJS . The first two completely clear their cookies after every request . The third account logs in to Google and persists cookies normally . The fourth account does not log in to Google , and also persists cookies normally .
Figure 6(a ) shows the average Jaccard Index for each account type ( logged in/logged out/no cookies ) across all search queries when compared to the control ( no cookies ) . In all of our figures , we place a * on the legend entry that corresponds to the control test , ie , two accounts that have identical features . We see from Figure 6(a ) that the results received by users are not dependent on whether they support cookies , or their login state with Google . However , just because the results are the same , does not mean that they are returned in the same order .
To examine how the order of results changes , we plot the average edit distance between each account type versus the control in Figure 6(b ) . We observe that a user ’s login state and cookies do impact the order of results from Google Search . The greatest difference is between users who are logged in versus users that clear their cookies . Logged in users receive results that are reordered in two places ( on average ) as compared to users with no cookies . Logged out users also receive reordered results compared to the no cookie user , but the difference is smaller . The results in Figure 6 give the first glimpse of how Google alters search results for different types of users .
Browser User Agent . Next , we examine whether the user ’s choice of browser or Operating System ( OS ) can impact search results . To test this , we created 11 Google accounts and assigned each one a different “ User Agent ” string . As shown in Table 3 , we encoded user agents for 5 browsers and 4 OSs . Chrome 22 and Windows 7 serve as the controls . Figure 7 shows the results for our browser experiments . Unlike the cookie tracking experiment , there is no clear differentiation between the different browsers and the control experiment . The results for different OSs are similar , and we omit them for brevity . Thus , we do not observe search personalization based on user agent strings .
Next , we investigate IP address Geolocation . whether Google Search personalizes results based on users’ physical location . To examine this , we create 11 Google accounts and run our test suite while forwarding the traffic d r a c c a J

Figure 8 shows the results of our location tests . There is a clear difference between the control and all the other locations . The average Jaccard Index for non control tests is 0.91 , meaning that queries from different locations generally differ by one result . The difference between locations is even more pronounced when we consider result order : the average edit distance for non control accounts is 212
These results reveal that Google Search does personalize results based on the user ’s geolocation . One example of this personalization can be seen by comparing the MA and CA results for the query “ pier one ” ( a home furnishing store ) . The CA results include a link to a local news story covering a store grand opening in the area . In contrast , the MA results include a Google Maps link and a CitySearch link that highlight stores in the metropolitan area .
Inferred Geolocation . During our experiments , we observed one set of anomalous results from experiments that tunneled through Amazon EC2 . In particular , 9 machines out of 22 rented from Amazon ’s North Virginia datacenter were receiving heavily personalized results , versus the other 13 machines , which showed no personalization . Manual investigation revealed that Google Search was returning results with couk links to the 9 machines , while the 13 other machines received zero couk links . The 9 machines receiving UK results were all located in the same /16 subnet . Figure 9 shows some of the results for this anomaly . Although we could not determine why Google Search believes the 9 machines are in the UK ( we believe it is due to an incorrect IP address geolocation database ) , we did confirm that this effect is independent of the Google account . As a result , we did not use EC2 machines as SSH tunnel endpoints for any of the results in this paper .
Google Account Attributes . In our next pair of tests , we examine whether Google Search uses demographic information from users’ Google accounts to personalize results . Users must provide their gender and age when they sign up for a Google account , which means that Google Search could leverage this information to personalize results .
To test this hypothesis , we created Google accounts with specific demographic qualities . As shown in Table 3 , we created “ female , ” “ male , ” and “ other ” accounts ( these are the 3 choices Google gives during account sign up ) , as well as accounts with ages 15 to 65 , in increments of 10 years . The control account in the gender tests is female , while the control in the age tests is 15 .
The results for the gender test are presented in Figure 10 . We do not observe personalization based on gender in our experiments . Similarly , we do not observe personalization based on profile age , and we omit the results for brevity .
5.3 Historical Features
We now examine whether Google Search uses an account ’s history of activity to personalize results . We consider three types of historical actions : prior searches , prior searches where the user clicks a result , and Web browsing history .
To create a plausible series of actions for different accounts , we use data from Quantcast , a Web analytics and advertising firm . Quantcast publishes a list of top websites ( similar to Alexa ) that includes the demographics of visitors to sites [ 30 ] , broken down into the 20 categories shown in Table 3 . Quantcast assigns each website a score for each demographic , where scores >100 indicate that the given demographic visits that website more frequently than average for the Web . The larger the score , the more heavily weighted the site ’s visitors are towards a particular demographic .
We use the Quantcast data to drive our historical experiments . In essence , our goal is to have different accounts “ act ” like a member of each of Quantcast ’s demographic groups . Thus , for each of our three experiments , we create 22 Google d r a c c a J

Figure 12 : Day to day consistency of results for the geolocation experiments .
Figure 13 : Day to day consistency within search query categories for the geolocation test . accounts , two of which only run the 120 control queries , and 20 of which perform actions ( ie , searching , searching and clicking , or Web browsing ) based on their assigned demographic before running the 120 control queries . For example , one account builds Web browsing history by visiting sites that are frequented by individuals earning >$150k per year . Each account is assigned a different Quantcast demographic , and chooses new action targets each day using weighted random selection , where the weights are based on Quantcast scores . For example , the >$150k browsing history account chooses new sites to browse each day from the corresponding list of URLs from Quantcast .
Search History . First , we examine whether Google Search personalizes results based on search history . Each day , the 20 test accounts search for 100 demographic queries before executing the standard 120 queries . The query strings are constructed by taking domains from the Quantcast top 2000 that have scores >100 for a particular demographic and removing subdomains and top level domains ( eg , wwwamazoncom becomes “ amazon ” ) .
Figure 11 shows the results of the search history test for four income demographics . The “ No History ” account does not search for demographic queries , and serves as the control . All accounts receive approximately the same search results , thus we do not observe personalization based on search history . This observation holds for all of the demographic categories we tested , and we omit the results for brevity .
Search Result Click History . Next , we examine whether Google Search personalizes results based on the search results that a user has clicked on . We use the same methodology as for the search history experiment , with the addition that accounts click on the search results that match their demographic queries . For example , an account that searches for “ amazon ” would click on the result for amazoncom Accounts will go through multiple pages of search results to find the correct link for a given query .
The results of the click history experiments are the same as for the search history experiments . There is little difference between the controls and the test accounts , regardless of demographic . Thus , we do not observe personalization based on click history , and we omit the results for brevity .
Browsing History . Finally , we investigate whether Google Search personalizes results based on Web browsing history ( ie , by tracking users on third party Web sites ) . In these experiments , each account logs into Google and then browses 5 random pages from 50 demographically skewed websites each day . We filter out websites that do not set Google cookies ( or Google affiliates like DoubleClick ) , since
Google cannot track visits to these sites . Out of 1,587 unique domains in the Quantcast data that have scores >100 , 700 include Google tracking cookies .
The results of the browsing history experiments are the same as for search history and click history : regardless of demographic , we do not observe personalization . We omit these results for brevity .
Discussion . We were surprised that the history driven tests did not reveal personalization on Google Search . One explanation for this finding is that account history may only impact search results for a brief time window , ie , carryover is the extent of history driven personalization on Google Search . As future work , we plan on conducting longer lasting history driven experiments to confirm our findings .
6 . QUANTIFYING PERSONALIZATION
In the previous section we demonstrate that Google Search personalization occurs based on 1 ) whether the user is logged in and 2 ) the location of the searching machine . In this section , we dive deeper into the data from our synthetic experiments to better understand how personalization impacts search results . First , we examine the temporal dynamics of search results . Next , we investigate the amount of personalization in different categories of queries . Finally , we examine the rank of personalized search results to understand whether certain positions are more volatile than others .
6.1 Temporal Dynamics
In this section , we examine the temporal dynamics of results from Google Search to understand how much results from Google Search change day to day , and whether personalized results are more or less volatile than non personalized search results . To measure the dynamics of Google Search over time , we compute the Jaccard Index and edit distance for search results from subsequent days . Figure 12 shows the day to day dynamics for our geolocation experiment . The xaxis shows which two days of search results are being compared , and each line corresponds to a particular test account . Figure 12 reveals three facts about Google Search . First , the lines in Figures 12 are roughly horizontal , indicating that the rate of change in the search index is constant . Second , we observe that there is more reordering over time than new results : average Jaccard Index is 0.9 , while average edit distance is 3 . Third , we observe that both of these trends are consistent across all of our experiments , irrespective of whether the results are personalized . This indicates that personalization does not increase the day to day volatility of search results .

Search Result Rank
Figure 15 : The percentage of results changed at each rank .
Dynamics of Query Categories . We now examine the temporal dynamics of results across different categories of queries . As shown in Table 1 , we use 12 categories of queries in our experiments . Our goal is to understand whether each category is equally volatile over time , or whether certain categories evolve more than others .
To understand the dynamics of query categories , we again calculate the Jaccard Index and edit distance between search results from subsequent days . However , instead of grouping by experiment , we now group by query category . Figure 13 shows the day to day dynamics for query categories during our geolocation experiment . Although we have 12 categories in total , Figure 13 only shows the 1 least volatile , and 4 most volatile categories , for clarity . The results for all other experiments are similar to the results for the geolocation test , and we omit them for brevity .
Figure 13 reveals that the search results for different query categories change at different rates day to day . Figure 13(a ) shows that there are more new results per day for “ politics ” and “ news ” queries . Similarly , Figure 13(b ) shows that queries for “ politics , ” “ news , ” and “ places ” all exhibit above average reordering each day . This reflects how quickly information in these categories changes on the Web . In the case of “ places , ” the reordering is due to location specific news items that fluctuate daily . In contrast , search queries for factual categories like “ what is ” and “ green ” ( environmentally friendly topics ) are less volatile over time .
6.2 Personalization of Query Categories
We now examine the relationship between different categories of search queries and personalization . In Section 5 , we demonstrate that Google Search does personalize search results . However , it remains unclear whether all categories of queries receive equal amounts of personalization .
To answer this question , we plot the cumulative distribute of Jaccard Index and edit distance for each category in Figure 14 . These results are calculated over all of our experiments ( ie , User Agent , Google Profile , geolocation , etc . ) for a single day of search results . For clarity , we only include lines for the 1 most stable category ( ie , Jaccard close to 1 , edit distance close to 0 ) , and the 4 least stable categories .
Figure 14 demonstrates that Google Search personalizes results for some query categories more than others . For example , 82 % of results for “ what is ” queries are identical , while only 43 % of results for “ gadgets ” are identical . Overall , “ politics ” is the most personalized query category , followed by “ places ” and “ gadgets . ” CDFs calculated over other days of search results demonstrate nearly identical results .
6.3 Personalization and Result Ranking
In this section , we focus on the volatility of results from Google Search at each rank , with rank 1 being the first result on the page and rank 10 being the last result . Understanding the impact of personalization on top ranked search results is critical , since eye tracking studies have demonstrated that users rarely scroll down to results “ below the fold ” [ 3 , 12 , 13 , 20 ] . Thus , we have two goals : 1 ) to understand whether certain ranks are more volatile in general , and 2 ) to examine whether personalized search results are more volatile than non personalized results .
To answer these questions , we plot Figure 15 , which shows the percentage of results that change at each rank . To calculate these values , we perform a pairwise comparison between the result at rank r ∈ [ 1 , 10 ] received by a test account and the corresponding control . We perform comparisons across all tests in all experiments , across all seven days of measurement . This produces a total number of results that are changed at each rank r , which we divide by the total number of results at rank r to produce a percentage . The personalized results come from the logged in/logged out and geolocation experiments ; all others are non personalized .
Figure 15 reveals two interesting features . First , the results on personalized pages are significantly more volatile than the results on non personalized pages . The result changes on non personalized pages represent the noise floor of the experiment ; at every rank , there are more than twice as many changes on personalized pages . Second , Figure 15 shows that the volatility at each rank is not uniform . Rank 1 exhibits the least volatility , and the volatility increases until it peaks at 33 % in rank 7 . This indicates that Google Search is more conservative about altering results at top ranks .
Given the extreme importance placed on rank 1 in Google Search , we now delve deeper into the 5 % of cases where the result at rank 1 changes during personalized searches . In

Figure 16 : Movement of results to and from rank 1 for personalized searches . each instance where the rank 1 result changes , we compare the results for the test account and the control to determine 1 ) what was the original rank of the result that moved to rank 1 , and 2 ) what is the new rank of the result that used to be at rank 1 . Figure 16 plots the results of this test . In the vast majority of cases , the rank 1 and 2 results switch places : 73 % of new rank 1 results originate from rank 2 , and 58 % of old rank 1 results move to rank 2 . Overall , 93 % of new rank 1 results come from the first page of results , while 82 % of old rank 1 results remain somewhere on the first result page . However , neither CDF sums to 100 % , ie , there are cases where the new rank 1 result does not appear in the control results and/or the old rank 1 result disappears completely from the test results . The latter case is more common , with 18 % of rank 1 results getting evicted completely from the first page of results .
7 . RELATED WORK
Comparing Search Engines . Several studies have examined the differences between results from different search engines . Two studies have performed user studies to compare search engines [ 2 , 44 ] . Although both studies uncover significant differences between competing search engines , neither study examines the impact of personalization . Sun et al . propose a method for visualizing different results from search engines that is based on expected weighted Hoeffding distance [ 37 ] . Although this technique is very promising , it does not scale to the size of our experiments .
Personalization . Personalized search has been extensively studied in the literature [ 8 , 19 , 23 , 27 , 29 , 36 , 39 , 43 ] . Dou et al . provide a comprehensive overview of techniques for personalizing search [ 6 ] . They evaluate many strategies for personalizing search , and conclude that mining user click histories leads to the most accurate results . In contrast , user profiles have low utility . The authors also note that personalization is not useful for all types of queries .
Other features besides click history have been used to power personalized search . Three studies leverage geographic location to personalize search [ 41,50,51 ] . Two studies have shown that user demographics can be reliably inferred from browsing histories , which can be useful for personalizing content [ 11,16 ] . To our knowledge , only one study has investigated privacy preserving personalized search [ 49 ] . Given growing concerns about the Filter Bubble effects , this area seems promising for future research .
Several studies have looked at personalization on systems other than search . Two studies have examined personalization of targeted ads on the Web [ 10,47 ] . One study examines discriminatory pricing on e commerce sites , which is essentially personalization of prices [ 22 ] .
8 . CONCLUDING DISCUSSION
Over the past few years , we have witnessed a trend of personalization in numerous Internet based services , including Web search . While personalization provides obvious benefits for users , it also opens up the possibility that certain information may be unintentionally hidden from users . Despite the variety of speculation on this topic , to date , there has been little quantification of the basis and extent of personalization in Web search services today .
In this paper , we take the first steps towards addressing this situation by introducing a methodology for measuring personalization on Web search engines . Our methodology controls for numerous sources of noise , allowing us to accurately measure the extent of personalization . We applied our methodology to real Google accounts recruited from AMT and observe that 11.7 % of search results show differences due to personalization . Using artificially created accounts , we observe that measurable personalization is caused by 1 ) being logged in to Google and 2 ) making requests from different geographic areas .
However , much work remains to be done : we view our results as a first step in providing transparency for users of Web search and other Web based services . In the paragraphs below , we discuss a few of the issues brought up by our work , as well as promising directions for future research .
Scope . In this paper , we focus on queries to US version of the Google Web Search . All queries are in English , and are drawn from topics that are primarily of interest to US residents . We leave the examination of Google sites in other countries and other languages to future work .
Incompleteness . As a result of our methodology , we are only able to identify positive instances of personalization ; we cannot claim the absence of personalization , as we may not have considered other dimensions along which personalization could occur . However , the dimensions that we chose to examine in this paper are the most obvious ones for personalization ( considering how much prior work has looked at demographic , location based , and history based personalization ) . Given that any form of personalization is a moving target , we aim to continue this work by running our data collection for a longer time , looking at additional categories of Web searches , examining searches from mobile devices , and looking at other user behaviors ( eg , using services like Gmail , Google+ , and Google Maps ) . We also plan on examining the impact of mechanisms that may disable personalization ( eg , opting out of personalization on Google Search , and enabling Do Not Track headers ) .
Generality . The methodology that we develop is not specific to Google Web Search . The sources of noise that we control for are present in other search engines ( eg , Bing , Google News Search ) as well as other Web based services ( eg , Twitter search , Yelp recommendations , etc ) We plan on applying our methodology to these and other search services to quantify personalization of different types .
In this paper , we focused on quantifying litImpact . eral differences in search results , eg , a.com is different from bcom However , we do not address the issue of semantic differences , ie , do a.com and b.com contain different information content ? If so , what is the impact of these differences ? While semantic differences and impact are challenging to quantify , we plan to explore natural language processing and user studies as a first step .
Open Source . We make all of the crawling and parsing code , as well as the Google Web Search data from Section 5 , available to the research community at http://personalizationccsneuedu/
