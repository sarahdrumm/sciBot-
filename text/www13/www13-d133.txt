ABSTRACT As an increasing number of human activities are moving to the Web , more and more teams are predominantly virtual . Therefore , formation and success of virtual teams is an important issue in a wide range of fields . In this paper we model social behavior patterns of team work using data from virtual communities . In particular , we use data about the Web community of the multiplayer online game Dota 2 to study cooperation within teams . By applying statistical analysis we investigate how and to which extent different factors of the team in the game , such as role distribution , experience , number of friends and national diversity , have an influence on the team ’s success . In order to complete the picture we also rank the factors according to their influence . The results of our study imply that cooperation within the team is better than competition .

INTRODUCTION
Team work is important in a wide range of fields and activities . Among others , professional sports and business activities are clear examples where conscious efforts are being made to institutionalize and promote collaborative values and practices . This is also true for the scientific domain , where the role of teamwork becomes increasingly important for the production of high impact science [ 3 ] .

The formation and success of virtual teams is an important topic in developing flexible organizations . Enterprises can now benefit from virtual interaction in environments where teamwork would have once been impossible , accessing previously unavailable expertise , as well as retaining the advantages of flat organizational structures [ 30 ] . Therefore , study cases of virtual teams have mainly focused on the entrepreneurial context [ 19 , 27 ] . However , as the Web is an intrinsic part of modern society , it provides an unprecedented opportunity to extensively observe social interactions in different contexts on a larger scale .
Online games have already been widely used to study social interactions . These environments reflect human psychology and behavior by recording individual actions and team transactions . Moreover , they can be considered as global research contexts because of their geographically distributed population . The nature of the teams is also very diverse with respect to team size , composition , strategies and goals [ 5 ] . The so called Massively Multiplayer Online RolePlaying Games ( MMORPGs ) are used as the main scenario to study online interactions in this context .
Empirical research has shown that team composition influences team success [ 5 ] . Following this approach , we aim to develop an understanding of cooperation within teams and the influence of cooperation on success . To this end , we study the community of the multiplayer online game Dota 2 [ 31 ] . In this game two teams , consisting of five members each , are pitted against each other with the task of defeating the opposing team . To achieve this goal , close cooperation and intelligent interaction between the members of the team are needed – a challenge that mirrors many “ real world ” situations . In MMORPGs player cooperation is possible while making his/her own progress and having individual tasks . Dota 2 , in contrast , is a game in which the players are always assigned to a team and thus have common goals and interests .
In our studies we investigate the influence of several factors on teams’ success . Our previous work gave evidence of the influence of role distribution , previous experiences and
1185 friendship ties on a team success [ 22 ] . This paper supplements our previous results providing a more detailed analysis of those factors and analyzing the impact of teams’ national diversity . Besides this , we rank the importance of these factors according to their influence on the teams’ success . Furthermore , most of the existing studies use qualitative approaches such as questionnaires , to learn about the behavior and the motivations of users . We , on the contrary , base our study on a large volume of in game event logs that are generated from the actions of each player . This quantitative approach offers a better understanding of the factors that influence the formation of a successful team .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows : In section 2 we explain the relevant game mechanics . In section 3 related work is presented . Descriptive statistics of the data are provided in section 4 . The results of the previous work are summarized in section 5 , and sections 6 and 7 presents further analysis and results . Our conclusions and plans for future work are presented in section 8 .
2 . THE GAME AND ITS COMMUNITY
Dota 2 [ 31 ] is a so called multiplayer online battle arena ( MOBA ) video game developed by Valve [ 33 ] . Each player controls a character called “ hero ” , who participates in a team combat with the objective to demolish the opposing team ’s fortified stronghold . We are aware that this is a very cruel terminology , but we stick to it since it stems from the game creators .
Players are pitted against each other as two distinct factions of five players each , the Radiant and the Dire . Their strongholds , called base towers , are located at opposing ends of a geographically balanced squared map ( see Figure 1 ) . These are connected by three main lanes , which are guarded by defensive towers and weaker computer controlled units , called creeps . Killed heroes revive in the corresponding area of their base after a waiting time proportional to their level and the game time . Through the destruction of enemy forces , heroes may gain both experience and gold . The former accumulates to gain higher levels that enhance the hero ’s attributes and abilities . The latter is the currency of the game , which is distributed to the team members according to their accomplishments . Gold also accumulates periodically to each hero . It is mainly used to acquire items that substantially complement or alter abilities , as well as to buy an instant revival of the hero .
Each player selects one hero out of 96 available in Dota 2 . These heroes are unique characters that differ in their initial attributes and special abilities . On the one hand , initial attributes categorize heroes primarily according to their strength , agility and intelligence . On the other hand , special abilities are a set of four unique spells specific to each hero ( for example , there are such spells as “ Enchant totem ” , “ Greevil ’s greed ” , “ Nature ’s guise ” and so on ) . Both attributes and abilities are enhanced with experience accumulated over the course of the game . Through the combination of initial attributes and special abilities different heroes are suited for different strategies ( in Dota 2 they say game “ roles ” ) and can be played in a variety of ways ( eg “ Pusher ” , “ Carry ” , “ Nuker ” , etc ) Each player chooses a strategy not only based on the selected hero , but also on the heroes of the other members of the team . Through the choices of these strategies the flexibility of the team is increased ; this facilitates the formation of more competitive teams .
Figure 1 : Map of Dota 2 ( from Dota 2 wiki [ 7] ) .
To get more details about each attribute , ability as well as game role , we recommend to address the official wiki page of Dota 2 [ 7 ] . In Table 1 we present three heroes from Dota 2 : “ Treant Protector ” , “ Phantom Lancer ” and “ Lina ” . We also provide the values of their main three attributes ( “ Strength ” , “ Intelligence ” and “ Agility ” ) as well as class to which they belong and game roles in which these heroes can be played . Dota 2 is a team oriented game in which strategy and team coordination is decisive to achieve a victory . Communication between team members is a vital part of the game , acting as a binding force that makes a team function . Players can communicate through typing , voice chat , pinging the map and writing on the minimap .
Valve has built a social network around Dota 2 utilizing Valve ’s Steam software [ 32 ] in order to provide social and community functionality for the game . Steam accounts save personal files and settings on the online accounts . The players can set up private games with friends or join public games . In private games , teams might , however , be formed not only by humans , but also by Artificial Intelligent ( AI ) bots . In this case other players in the community are locked out and the game is played with computer controlled heroes , who can also interpret simple commands of human players . Dota 2 has not been publicly released yet . Even if its beta version limits its test early access , it is currently one of the cornerstone games at several electronic sports tournaments , and considered one of the best and highest e sport games [ 11 , 25 , 14 ] .
3 . RELATED WORK
Virtual worlds are playing an important role in the study of diverse fields such as sociology [ 16 ] , psychology [ 36 , 8 ] , economy [ 20 , 24 ] , etc . These studies raise the question of how the mechanisms of human behavior are being translated and developed in an artificial environment . Teams within virtual communities have also been the focus of attention of a number of studies . Early studies described their characteristics agreeing that such teams are more diverse than conventional teams , with members representing not only differ

Gameplay data and player characteristics are drawing the attention of recent studies in the field of social computing and web science [ 21 ] . In particular the study of Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games ( MMORPGs ) are gathering most of the attention . This is due to their nature that allows players’ cooperation and competition on a large scale , as well as interaction assuming the role of a character whose actions can be controlled , in the case of MMORPGs . The social interactions that take place in them are well explored demonstrating the crucial role that they play . Cole et al . [ 4 ] examine them through the analysis of online questionnaires that interrogate about social interactions that occur both within and outside MMORPGs . Their results show that these are extremely social games that favor the possibilities of players making life long friends and partners . Recent studies analyze log data of this kind of games with the aim to build models of human features and behavior , such as activities , interactions and cooperations [ 29 ] .
Kalu˙za et al . [ 16 ] used the MMORPG World of Warcraft as a case study that they analyze from a sociological viewpoint . In their study they identify players’ communication as a driver for community engagement . Their descriptive research concludes that origin , culture and language are important factors of player attractiveness that have an effect on the creation of national guilds , communication problems and generalization of players’ behavior based on the country of origin . The significance of cultural issues has been corroborated by Jacobs [ 15 ] , who qualitatively analyzes racism , nationalism , and culture wars within multicultural Internet communities such as the MMORPG Omerta . These conclusions , however , have not been accompanied by concomitant research efforts to quantitatively demonstrate the impact of geographical , cultural and linguistic factors on the MMORPGs team ’s success . Existing quantitative studies that analyze the geographical distribution of MMORPG players mainly focus on the prediction of the servers work load , and players’ subscription and disinterest in the game [ 35 , 26 ] .
Group formation of gamers is also examined in one of the latest studies of Keegan et al . [ 17 ] who collected data about characters and accounts from the Sony Online Entertainment ’s MMORPG EverQuest II . Cooperation and competition in online games is examined by Yuan et al.[37 ] by conducting a quantitative study and analyzing game logs . Their results show that the selection based on in game score level of partners to cooperate with is important for the players , while choosing the opponents is slightly biased .
The categorization MOBA ( Multiplayer Online Battle Arena games , also known as Dota like games , often refers to games with two teams of players competing against each other and controlling a single character in the battlefield . Although this genre emphasizes a more cooperative teamplay , the literature about it is very scarce . A very recent paper analyzes the relationship between real life leadership styles ( authoritarian , democratic or laissez faire ) and game roles of two MOBA games , Dota 2 and Heroes of Newerth [ 23 ] . The method used was a close ended questionnaire to examine daily life and gameplay behaviors .
Dota 2 as a game differs from MMORPGs since this is first of all a team game and only afterward a game with elements of traditional MMORPGs . The team perspective is the main focus of our analysis , which is based in previous work [ 22 ] . We are not aware of any other recent work using game log data to analyze the behavior and interaction of MOBA players , and with our studies we aim to cover the gap .
4 . THE GAME AND ITS DATA
The data set , which is used for this study , has been retrieved in XML from Steam and Dota 2 utilizing their Web APIs [ 34 , 6 ] and was afterwards migrated to PostgreSQL . The data was made public by the community of Dota 2 players , and contains the match history as well as details of the matches that were played in the year 2011 .
1187 Using the Steam API we incorporate additional information of those players that appear in the match history of the Dota 2 data . This information is extracted from the players’ profiles on the Steam platform . Such profiles contain personal information such as name , country , sign up date , last log off date , etc . The list of friends of the social network is also extracted ( see also Section 2 ) . However , the accessibility of this information dependents on the confidentiality status of the user profile , which can be public or private .
The data set includes information on 885,228 matches . Since we focus on team aspects , we need details about both the matches and the players involved , such as :
• Start time and duration of a match ; • Outcome of a match ( ie , which team wins ) ; • The number of human players in a team ( there are also teams that include AI bots – see Section 2 ) ;
• The difficulty or “ skill ” of a match ( there are four dif ferent levels – low , normal , high and very high ) ;
• Account ids and additional information on the players , such as their countries ;
• Heroes chosen by a player as well as the performance of those heroes in the match ( ie , how often they are defeated , how many others they damage , how much gold they acquire and so on ) .
For the majority of the matches in the data set not all this information is provided , so we filter them out . Also we keep only the matches that contain two teams with five players in each team and all players have public profiles .
The filtered data set comprises 87,204 matches , which are played by 138,101 individuals . 71,874 out of those 138,101 players ( ie , 52 % ) indicate their country . In total , the players come from 233 different countries ; the top 10 countries are : USA ( 16,032 resp . 22.3% ) , Russia ( 13,799 resp . 19.2% ) , then Canada , Sweden and Germany ( approximately 3,800 resp 5.4 % each ) , Ukraine ( 2,711 resp . 3.8% ) , Great Britain ( 2,253 resp . 3.1% ) , France ( 1,503 resp . 2.1% ) , Finland ( 1,311 resp . 1.8 % ) and Poland ( 1,175 resp . 16 % ) Thus , as it can be seen in Figure 2 , only 10 different countries account for approximately 70 % of the players ( 50,396 out of 71,874 ) . Overall , there are three predominant regions – Eastern Europe , Western Europe and North America . About 29.2 % of the players ( approximately 21,000 ) are located in each of them . So in total , about 90 % of the players come from these three regions . Considerably fewer players are from Asia ( 7% ) , South America ( 2.6% ) , Oceania ( 2.5 % ) and Africa ( 1% ) . It should be noted that the distribution of players does not represent the world population nor the population of Internet users . This puts some limitations on our results .
5 . PREVIOUS RESULTS
In this section we shortly summarize the results of our previous paper [ 22 ] which we are building upon . We show how different factors ( ie role distribution , previous experiences and friendship ties ) influence team success in a virtual environment .
The first factor under our consideration was the role distribution within the team . To analyze it , we calculated a unique hero score for each hero of Dota 2 . For this purpose
Figure 2 : The top 10 countries where the players come from . we incorporated additionally data about initial attributes of the heroes . Then we took data about heroes selected by the players and outcome of the matches ( 872,040 data points for 10 players in 87,204 matches ) and trained a logistic regression model on 70 % of observations from our data set . In the end , the calculated coefficients were applied to the rest of our data set .
Another factor which influences the team success is the experience of players . As for the gaming experience of players , we considered not only information about the amount of previously played and won matches and the played time , but also information about performance in previous matches . After a match ends each player receives statistics about his/her performance which includes 13 different measures such as #kills , #deaths , spent gold , final level and so on . In total we get 17 different attributes related to the gaming experience of each player . Following the same reasoning as for hero selection , we used logistic regression on experience attributes to calculate an experience score for each player in a specific match .
Figure 3 shows the results of a Spearman correlation test ( ie , correlation coefficients and their significance ) and scatter plots between hero score , experience score and win on the data set which we use to calculate the scores . Variable win is binary and indicates whether a player was in the winning team ( value 1 ) or in the losing team ( value 0 ) . Variables hero score and experience score are numerical and range from 0 to 1000 according to the way we calculate these scores . As we see , there is a significant high correlation coefficient ( 63 % ) between experience score and hero score . This observation can be explained by the fact that the higher gaming experience of the player , the better he/she is at choosing heroes . The correlation with variable win , though significant , is very low : for hero score it is 2.1 % and experience score it is 17 % However , with further analysis we could show that the team composition is an important factor for the match outcome . These are explained in our previous paper [ 22 ] and summarized in the following .
We tested whether the role distribution ( ie , selecting a specific hero ) is important for the team success . For that
1188 In the following section we examine the teams’ national diversity as another factor of team success .
6 . NATIONAL DIVERSITY
Here national diversity is defined as the number of distinct countries the members of a team come from . To analyze it , the following statistical tests are applied :
• In order to test if the number of distinct countries within a team and the outcome of the game are independent , χ2 tests are performed .
• In cases where we have only two groups ( eg , when grouping countries ) and we want to investigate if there is a dependency between the group a team belongs to and the outcome of the game , Fisher ’s exact test is applied . The reason is that for small contingency tables this test is more accurate than the χ2 test([2] ) . When performing Fisher ’s exact test , R ( [1 ] ) moreover , also calculates the odds ratio . In case of a dependency , this ratio indicates which teams are more likely to win – those of the first group or those of the second one .
As discussed in Section 4 , not all the players report their country . For our analysis we keep only those teams where the country is known for all of its members . This is true for 8567 teams . A summary of the filtered data set is given in Table 2 . We see , for example , that teams , where all five members come from the same country , win in 391 out of 778 cases ; and teams , where the players are from two different countries , win in 1229 out of 2362 cases . We would like to stress that there is no opportunity to verify that the country indicated by the player is credible .

391 1229 1374 987 313
50.25 % 52.03 % 48.76 % 50.43 % 48.01 %
As it is indicated in Table 2 , it seems that there is no dependency between the number of distinct countries within a team and the outcome of the game . We perform a χ2test that confirms this impression ( χ2 = 6.7942 , p value = 01472 )
Since there is no dependency we take a deeper look into the data and divide it into two groups ( see also Table 3 ) :
• Group A : Teams with members from one or two different countries . Those teams have a win rate of 516 % • Group B : Teams with members from three or more different countries . Those teams have a win rate of 493 %
We apply Fisher ’s exact test to check whether the difference in the win rates is statistically significant . We get a p value of 0.039 and thus a small evidence that there is a dependency between the outcome of a match and the group a team belongs to . Furthermore , the odds ratio of 0.9073 indicates in this context that teams of group A are slightly
Figure 3 : Correlation coefficients , their significance and scatter plots between hero score , experience ∗p < 0.1;∗∗ p < score and win . Significance levels : 0.05;∗∗∗ p < 001 purpose we calculated the team hero score for each team in a specific match as the average of hero score for the heroes selected by the team members . We formed two normally distributed samples , containing the scores for the winning and losing team and tested whether the mean difference of team hero score of these samples is equal to zero . We found that team hero score positively influences the team success . To analyze if experience impacts the result of the game we calculated a team experience score for each team in a specific match as the average of the experience scores of the team members . Again we formed two normally distributed samples , containing the scores for the winning and losing team . We tested the dependence of team success on team experiences score and found that a winning team has on average a higher team experience score than a losing team . In order to study if playing with friends influences the outcome of a game , we calculated the maximum number of friends that each team player has in the team . We called it max # friends , which ranges from 0 to 4 . We could conclude that max # friends and the outcome of the game are dependent variables . Furthermore , we checked how the number of friends influences the team success . We formed two samples with max # friends for the winning team and losing team . As a result , the mean amount of friends for winning teams is significantly higher than for the losing teams .
Summarizing the findings for our previous work , we can provide evidence for the following accepted hypothesis :
1 . a better role distribution in a team increases the pos sibilities of a successful outcome ;
2 . teams with more experienced players are more likely to win ;
3 . playing with friends increases the chance to win .
1189 more likely to win than teams of group B – which implies that teams with one or two different countries are more likely to succeed than teams with three or more different countries . to ( p value = 0001 ) The odds ratio of 0.775 implies that teams of group A , ie teams with a low number of different countries , are more likely to be successful .

In a further exploration , we also take into account the difficulty of a game . Hence , we differentiate the matches according to their skill level , which is an indicator for the difficulty ( see Section 4 ) . There we get 4061 matches of skill level 0 , 3796 of skill level 1 and 710 of skill level 2 .
When looking at those categories separately , we obtain the following results ( see also Table 4 ) :
• For matches of skill level 0 there is a statistically significant dependency between the number of distinct countries within a team and the outcome of the match ( p value smaller than 005 )
• For matches of skill level 1 and skill level 2 no such association can be found ( both p values larger than 005 )

Thus , we take a closer look at matches of skill level 0 . Table 5 provides more details on the number of distinct countries and the win rates of teams playing in matches of skill level 0 .

In Table 5 we also see that the win rate depends on the number of distinct countries . So we again divide the teams into two groups : Group A comprises all teams where the members are from the same country or from two different countries . Teams where the players come from three or more countries belong to group B . The number of teams in each group and the win rates are indicated in Table 6 . Fisher ’s exact test shows that there is a strong association between the outcome of the match and the group the team belongs
In summary , it can be said that a team performs better if its members are only from one or two countries . This is especially true for matches where the players are not so advanced yet , ie , matches with skill level 0 . Nevertheless , as we show , this appears not to be an advantage any more if the matches get more difficult .
As Dota 2 is a game in which close coordination and smart interactions are important for the success of a team , it is no surprise that team members that have the same background and speak the same language have an advantage over teams that can not communicate so easily . However , our results clearly imply that if the players become more advanced , it is not crucial how a team is composed in terms of nationality – its performance does no depend on it . 7 . RANKING FACTORS
Up to now we have shown how and to which extent different factors , ie , hero score , experience score , max # friends , national diversity , have an influence on the game outcome . In order to obtain a more complete picture we would like to rank these factors . However , since only few players indicate their country of origin and according to the low significance of the dependency test of national diversity on the game outcome , we exclude the factor national diversity from this analysis . Therefore , we analyze which of the three factors ( hero score , experience score , max # friends ) have the strongest influence on the team success and whether the influence of these factors is preserved if we consider them together .
For this purpose we perform log linear analysis . We first normalize the scores and fit our data into the logistic regression model in R [ 1 ] since the game outcome is a binary variable . Afterwards , we perform analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) on the fitted model to explore the deviance . We use type III tests since they test each term in the model after all of the others [ 12 ] . Since we have both categorical ( ie , max # friends ) and numerical factors ( ie , hero score and experience score ) , we use Wald ’s and likelihood ratio χ2 statistics . According to the results ( see Table 7 ) , max # friends has the highest deviance and can be considered as the most influential factor . However , hero score and experience score have also significant influence . In Table 7 column “ Df ” shows the degree of freedom for the corresponding factor .
By using Wald statistic instead of Log likelihood Ratio ( LR ) one from Table 7 , we check what is the influence of intercept on the game outcome – this is a constant introduced by the logistic regression model in R . Table 8 presents the results of ANOVA performed with Wald test , indicating that intercept is a significant term , but with deviance lower than that of the other three factors .
Table 9 summarizes the information about the fitted logistic regression model which we used for ANOVA in Tables 7

Our previous work has also demonstrated that hero score and max # friends positively influence the game outcome which is coherent with the coefficients of these factors in our fitted model . Moreover , we showed that the bigger amount of friends play together , the bigger the chance to win , and in our fitted model the coefficient for max # friends = 4 is the highest . This result also confirms our previous findings .
In addition , in our previous work we showed that the experience score positively influences the success of the team ( see Section 5 and our previous work [ 22] ) . Moreover , in Figure 3 the correlation coefficient between win and experience score is positive . However , the coefficient of this factor in the fitted model is negative ( see Table 9 ) . This is a contradiction .
To explain the obtained contradiction we conduct a partial correlation test ( see Table 10 ) . The results of this test show that the correlation coefficient between win and experience score becomes negative given hero score , but with a very small coefficient ( around 2% ) . Our first understanding of this observation is that if players with less experience manage to select heroes as well as the opponents with more experience do ( ie , both teams have the same team hero score ) , then the first must have some hidden potential which is negatively accounted for in the experience score . This calls for futher investigation .
We have also constructed the full logistic regression model on our data , ie , using not only each factor separately as shown above , but also considering all possible combinations of these factors . The ANOVA shows that the model does not improve if we consider partial combinations of the factors .
In the last step , we can rank factors in decreasing order according to the strength of their influence on the team success ( see Tables 7 and 8 ) :
1 . max # friends which measures the social ties inside the team ;
2 . hero score which is the indicator of role distribution inside the team ;
3 . experience score which is the aggregate measure of ex perience of the team members .

This list shows that playing with friends is the most important factor for winning the game . Additionally , we need to have a good distribution of roles inside the team . The last factor according to its contribution to the explanation of variance is experience . It is worth mentioning that team experience score is just an aggregation of individual experience scores for each team member and does not consider the experience of the team as a whole . Thus , it is clear that this factor has the least influence out of all three factors . All put together can be interpreted that cooperation and social ties ( in other words playing with friends ) inside the team is more crucial for the team success than individual skills of team members .
8 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We use the data from the online game Dota 2 and its community to treat the questions of factors for team success . We provide small evidence to support the hypothesis that national diversity influences the game outcome . Here there are two points which need to be considered . First of all , there is no opportunity to verify the country which the player indicates in his/her profile . Secondly , when analyzing the national diversity of a team we considered only the amount
1191 of distinct countries from which the players come . In the future we will also investigate the cultural distance of the members of a team as shown by Shenkar [ 28 ] .
We rank the factors of team success discovered in our pre vious work according to the strength of their influence :
1 . max # friends which measures the social ties inside the team ;
2 . hero score which is the indicator of role distribution inside the team ;
3 . experience score which is the aggregate measure of ex perience of the team members .
Thus , the most important indicator for the success of the team is the number of friends playing together in the team , especially at the beginner levels of the matches . Moreover , it is better if they come from the same country . The least influential factor is the team experience score which , given the way it is calculated , is not surprising : this score summarizes only individual skills of all team members , but not of the whole team . This implies that cooperation is better than competition inside the team within the game Dota 2 . Furthermore , our results show that data on online gaming and gaming communities can be used to infer social behavior patterns . However , we simplify team dynamics considering only three aspects , which are studied as independent variables . In the future we plan to extend the model to ensure that the influence of these three factors is not due to other hidden factors like gender or age . It could be also introduced a more sophisticated measure of role distribution inside the team , eg , by taking into account not only heroes selected by each team member , but also weighting each choice with the previous experience with the selected hero . Since we find evidence that cooperation is better than competition inside the team , we will consider the introduction of a new score to measure individualism and collectivism of a player . Hofstede argues in his book [ 13 ] that such measure influences work related values .
As we have seen , the existence of friends within a team influence the performance of that team in a clearly positive way . Thus , in a next step , we plan to study the central role that this factor plays in the composition of teams in more detail . With the help of network analysis techniques we want to take a deeper look at the friendship networks of the players on Steam platform ( see also Section 2 ) . In our current work we only take into consideration the maximum number of friends within a team ( ie , “ direct links ” in this friendship network ) and its impact on the team ’s success . In a next step we want to factor in additional , structural information . We will look , for example , at the average distance of the team members within the friendship network or if the team members form a clique ( ie , a complete subgraph ) in order to identify structural properties and patterns that influence the outcome of a match in a positive way . We might also be able to answer the question whether players of the game become friends because they play together or rather they convince already existing friends to join the game .
Besides the friendship network that is explicitly given on the Steam platform , we will study in our future work networks that are implicitly given in this context . For example , we will use our data to construct a co playing network . This might help to investigate how often subgroups of the team members as well as the team as a whole have already played together before . Network analysis techniques can then also lead to deeper insights into both the local structure ( ie , clusters of individuals that often play within a team ) and the global structure ( ie , number and size of connected components , density , and so on ) of such a co playing network .
One of the limitations of our findings is that we have provided quantitative evidence for success factors only on a gaming data set . Therefore , another direction for our future work is the comparison of our findings against other domains , such as scientific publication or wiki editing domains . That would provide an opportunity to generalize our results .
