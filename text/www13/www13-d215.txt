ABSTRACT A major difficulty in a recommendation system for groups is to use a group aggregation strategy to ensure , among other things , the maximization of the average satisfaction of group members . This paper presents an approach based on the theory of noncooperative games to solve this problem . While group members can be seen as game players , the items for potential recommendation for the group comprise the set of possible actions . Achieving group satisfaction as a whole becomes , then , a problem of finding the Nash equilibrium . Experiments with a MovieLens dataset and a function of arithmetic mean to compute the prediction of group satisfaction for the generated recommendation have shown statistically significant results when compared to state of the art aggregation strategies , in particular , when evaluation among group members are more heterogeneous . The feasibility of this unique approach is shown by the development of an application for Facebook , which recommends movies to groups of friends .

INTRODUCTION
Traditional recommendation systems do perform personalized suggestions of items and that are of potential interest for a system ’s user [ 22 , 6 , 1 , 8 ] . A recommendation system generates an item suggestion to a user based on a profile of interests . Such profile is automatically built from the individual items evaluation made by this user . Based on this interest profile , similarity analysis techniques between users , known as collaborative filtering [ 11 ] or between items , known as content based filtering [ 20 ] , are used to generate the recommendation . In recent years alternative approaches to generating recommendations for individuals have emerged , such

The scientific literature related to recommendations for individuals is actually fairly wide . However , some scenarios require for recommendations for group of people and the techniques mentioned so far do not solve this new problem . As an example scenario of recommendation for groups are recommending repertoire of songs for a party , recommending a restaurant for a business lunch , a travel destination for family and movies for a group of friends .
Among the difficulties that arise in a group recommendation system is the need for an aggregation strategy for the generation of the recommendation . Recent scientific literature has enumerate three possible types of aggregation strategies [ 13 , 5 , 16 ] : ( i ) merge the lists of individual recommendations obtained for each individual member in a single list for the group , ( ii ) aggregate the individual preferences of all group members to particular items using some strategy traditionally based on the Social Choice Theory [ 3 , 23 , 21 ] , or ( iii ) create a unique profile to the group as a whole . The choice of aggregation strategy best suited to the recommendation system for groups is not a trivial task . This strategy needs to consider that group members wish to meet their own preferences . At the same time , it has to prevent that certain users keep always dissatisfied with the recommendation they receive ( misery ) and must ensure fairness in the recommendation for the group [ 15 ] . In specific contexts , where groups are formed randomly and , thus , the chances for heterogeneity are increased , this task is especially hard . Indeed , the tentative to solve such a conflict by means of some cooperative approach which try to reach a consensus in heterogeneous random groups may result in a negotiation agreement failure . Examples of such cooperative approaches are presented in [ 4 ] , [ 26 ] , [ 10 ] . The work of [ 25 ] shows that the increase in the number of group members leads to decreased satisfaction average for the group ’s recommendation . We argue that a rational way of solving conflicts of interest between members of heterogeneous random groups should arise from Non Cooperative Game Theory [ Von Neumann and Morgenstern , 1947 ] .
This paper thus proposes an innovative approach based on noncooperative games for recommending items to a group . Members are the players of the game , the items are modeled as game actions and the recommendation itself is modeled as a problem of finding the Nash equilibrium , performing a rational selection of the items set . Considering a stable strategy profile , the Nash equilibrium means that consider
951 ing that the other players will not modify their own strategies , the current player has no incentive to change its own . Modeling recommendation for groups as a noncooperative game can meet the need for a balance between satisfying the own preferences of a member of the group and avoid the dissatisfaction of other group members through justice in the recommendation . Although users have their own interests , there will always be at least one Nash equilibrium , so the system can always make a recommendation to the group . This paper extends previous work [ 7 ] , where the game actions had been defined from the result of the aggregation strategies of individual preference .
Specific goals are twofold : ( i ) provide proper formalization to the problem and ( ii ) develop a movie recommendation system for groups that runs on Facebook .
Section 2 reviews recommender systems for groups .
In Section 3 , we define formally the problem of recommendation for groups as a noncooperative game . Section 4 presents an illustrative example of the functioning of the approach to a small number of users in a group . Section 5 discusses experimental results with MovieLens datasets and presents the movie recommendation system developed as a Facebook application . Finally , section 6 presents some concluding remarks and future work .
2 . GROUP RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
Although recommendation systems traditionally recommend items for individual users , there is an increasing amount of research focused on recommendation for groups of users [ 16 , 13 ] . In such case , recommendations aim to satisfy a group of users with potentially conflicting interests .
The need for choosing a method of aggregation to generate recommendations is the key characteristic of group recommendation . Although different aggregation strategies differ in the way they manipulate and represent users’ preferences , virtually all of them adopts one of three schemes : ( 1 ) aggregates a single set of individual recommendations , ( 2 ) builds a unique representation model for the group , or ( 3 ) aggregate the ratings/preferences for particular items .
Average , Least Misery and Plurality Vote are three of the main aggregation strategies studied in the related scientific literature . Average strategy assumes equal importance to group members and computes the average of the group evaluation for the items . The disadvantage of this strategy is due to the heavy reliance on group size . For groups with fewer members , for instance , each member opinion has a greater impact on the average . Least Misery strategy considers the evaluation made by the less satisfied group member as the satisfaction value for the whole group . The disadvantage of this strategy is that an item in which most members are little satisfied will probably be recommended rather than a item to which just one member is very unsatisfied whereas the others are pleased , for instance .
In the aggregation strategy Plurality Vote , each group member votes on the item with the highest individual preference . Although such strategy fulfills most of the group , the minority gets unsatisfied , eventually .
According to [ 24 ] , aggregation strategies can be divided into three categories :
• strategies consensus based : considers the preferences of all group members . Among the strategies in this category are Average , Average without Misery , Fairness and Multiplicative .
• majority based strategies : uses the most popular items among group members . Among the strategies in this category is Plurality Voting .
• borderline strategies : consider only a subset of items in individual profiles based on user roles or any other relevant criteria . In the Dictatorship strategy , for instance , a single member imposes his taste for the rest of the group . Least Misery and Most Pleasure strategies consider only the lowest and highest level of interest , respectively , among the group members .
Aggregation strategies may be evaluated according to a sort of different metrics [ 13 ] :
• Maximize average satisfaction : a function that computes some kind of average predictions of satisfaction for each member to use as the basis for the selection of candidate items ;
• Minimize misery : a function that measures the level of dissatisfaction of one or more members ;
• Ensure some degree of fairness : a function that measures how balanced is the level of satisfaction among members of the group concerning the given recommendation .
Different kind of groups affect the way users evaluate the result of the adopted aggregation strategy . In Polylens [ 19 ] , which consists of permanent groups , recommendation provided by Least Misery strategy had been accepted by 77 % of the users . The fact that members get to know each other in advance contributes to minimize misery , for instance . As stated before , homogeneity or heterogeneity levels also affect recommendation quality . In the evaluation of YU ’s TV Recommender [ 26 ] , the Average strategy achieved good performance for homogeneous groups . In contrast , the result worsened significantly as the group was getting closer the complete heterogeneity .
3 . PROBLEM DEFINITION
Let I = {i1 , i2 , , in} and U = {u1 , u2 , , uk} be the set of all items and all users , respectively . Consider a set G of all groups with at least two members that may be formed by U and so , |G| = 2k − k − 1 . Consider , finally , g ∈ G and |g| defined as the number m of group members g . If , for instance , a group consists of users u1 , u2 and u3 , thus this can be expressed as g = {u1 , u2 , u3} and |g| .
Let us assume p(u , i ) as the evaluation for the item i usersupplied u , and p(u , i ) = 0 , if user u did not evaluate the item i . Consider ˆp(u , i ) as the predictive evaluation of item i for user u . The predicted evaluation ˆp(u , i ) is obtained from a prediction function ˆp which considers , in turn , the similarity between items s : I × I → R or the similarity between users s : U × U → R .
The items to be potentially recommended for each group belong to the set of items that have not been evaluated by any group member . These items are obtained from the intersection of the lists of items to which no member of the group has provided an evaluation ( equation 1 ) .

H =
{i | ˆp(u , i ) = ∅ , i ∈ I}
( 1 )
The group recommendation problem is modeled as a noncooperative game in the Normal Form and the items to be recommended to the group are those in Nash equilibrium . A game in the Normal Form is a tuple ( m , A , f ) , where : • m is the number of players ( group members ) , indexed by j ;
• A = A1xxAm , with Aj being a finite set of actions available to the player j . A vector a = ( a1 , , am ) ∈ A is known as actions’ profile .
• f = ( f1 , , fm ) , with fj : A → R being an utility function that computes a payoff for player j .
We have fixed a set of three possible actions to be available to a player in the action set Aj . These actions concern the three items with higher predicted values . The payoff function for each player considers the union of the item chosen as game action for each player j to form a actions’ profile ( equation 2 ) .
R = aj
( 2 )
The payoff function ( equation 3 ) calculates the predicted satisfaction of the member u from the result of the actions chosen by all players in a given game strategy . m j=1 i∈R f ( u ) =
ˆp(u , i ) |R|
( 3 )
Intuitively , the player wants to find the aggregation strategy that maximizes the result of its payoff function . A Nash equilibrium is a stable strategy profile : it means that considering that other players will not modify their own strategies , the current player has no incentive to change its owns . In case of the existence of more than one Nash equilibria for the group , the choice of which of these will be recommended is accomplished by a harmonic mean ( equation 4 ) . This function performs the calculation based on the preferences of the group members for all of the items from each of the found Nash equilibria . The set with the highest harmonic mean is chosen . Since the harmonic mean prioritizes sets of values with smaller variance , it encourages justice in the recommendation . An experiment conducted by Masthoff [ 15 ] with volunteers has shown that group members are concerned about the balance between justice and meet their own preferences . harmonic(x ) = n n i=1

The proposed approach is illustrated in figure 1 .

( 9.0 , 3.0 ) ( 8.0 , 5.0 ) ( 7.0 , 4.5 )
The actions of player Peter have been chosen among the items A , D and E , once these had been the three better evaluated items by this user . The lines in the payoff matrix represent the actions . B , C and D are the items for player Jane and are properly represented as game actions in the columns of the same payoff matrix ( figure 2 ) . The payoff values for each player have been calculated by equation 3 .
This payoff matrix has a single Nash equilibrium with strategy ( A , B ) , where A is the item which represents the action to be chosen by Peter and B is the item which represents the action to be chosen by Jane . 7.0 ( seven ) is thus the payoff value for Peter and 5.0 ( five ) the payoff value for Jane . In case there were others Nash equilibria , the harmonic mean would be used , as stated before .
The strategy ( A , B ) has been selected as the only Nash equilibrium of this example . The reason is that if Peter chooses action A , Jane would have no benefit in changing her action from B to C or D , since the payoff would decrease . Likewise , considering that Jane chooses action B , Peter would have no benefit to change the action from A to D or E . This situation only occurs with the couple of actions ( A , B ) .
5 . EXPERIMENTS
Experiments have been performed in order to compare the proposed approach with three different state of the art aggregation strategies : Least Misery ( LM ) , Average and Plurality Vote ( PV ) . Each strategy belongs to a different aggregation category according to [ 24 ] .
Two different experimentation scenarios have been set , varying the levels of homogeneity among group members . 5.1 Dataset
The MovieLens 1 datasets are widely used in group recommendation research even though they do not actually provide information on groups . This is due to the complete lack of other well established and more suitable bases . The chosen dataset consists of 943 users , 1,682 movies and 100,000 movie ratings in the [ 1 , 5 ] interval . 5.2 Experimentation Setup
For the first experimentation scenario , a list of rating predictions to every movie not yet seen by neither user in a group has been generated from individual evaluations p(u , i )
1http://wwwgrouplensorg/node/73/
953 Figure 1 : New Approach Overview existent in the dataset . The rating predictions were generated by means of a collaborative filtering algorithm based on KNN ( K Nearest Neighbor ) [ 9 ] . The histogram of figure 1 shows the distribution for the first experimentation scenario . Predictions have a mean value of 4.01 and low standard deviation of 041
The second scenario concerns an artificial distribution built upon evaluation values randomly generated so as to compose a scenario with evaluation values more dispersed . The histogram of Figure 3 shows the correspondent distribution . Predictions have a mean value of 2.5 with standard deviation of 101
√
In order to deal with the absence of groups in the MovieLens dataset , the users have been automatically grouped 943 and ranwith K Means clustering [ 14 ] , with K = domly generated initial centroid . Users of these clusters were randomly selected to form two kind of groups : ( i ) homogeneous group , with users from same cluster and ( ii ) heterogeneous group , with users from different clusters . A total of 28 groups with 3 , 5 and 7 members have been generated for each kind , for a total of 336 groups .
The three actions available to each player were chosen among the items with the highest player rating prediction from the list of potential recommendations ( list of items not yet evaluated by any group member ) . The tool Gambit [ 17 ] was used to set the games in the normal form and compute the Nash equilibria .
5.3 Evaluation Metric
We compared the result of the aggregation strategy based on the theory of non cooperative games and Nash equilibrium with other state of the art aggregation strategies . A prediction function for group satisfaction for recommended items has been used to evaluate the result ( equation 5 ) .
S(g , R ) =
S(u , R ) |g|
( 5 )
This function is constructed from the average of individual satisfactions of each group member to the list of recommended items ( equation 6 ) . u∈g i∈R
S(u , R ) =
ˆp(u , i ) |R|
( 6 )
The maximization of S(g , R ) means maximizing average satisfaction of the group members to the list of recommended items . The comparison between the aggregation strategies for predicting average satisfaction of the group is performed based on the paired samples 2 tailed t test with confidence interval of 95 % , where the value of the result to be considered statiscally significant must provide p < 005

In table 3 , for homogeneous groups , the results of Equilibrium strategy was worse than other strategies if we consider a maximum of 5 members per group . With 7 members , instead , Equilibrium strategy has performed better than Plurality Vote . Results also do not show statistically significant differences between Equilibrium strategy and the Least Misery strategy . Experiments with heterogeneous groups show very similar results ( table 4 ) .
Table 6 shows the correlation between the number of group members and the results of different strategies . It confirms that the strategy Equilibrium is the one that has the least negative correlation between the satisfaction of the group members and group size . The same occurs for heterogeneous groups in the first scenario .
Table 5 summarizes the comparison between strategies for both homogeneous and heterogeneous groups , regardless the number of members in the group . The Equilibrium strategy

The difference between tables 5 and 9 shows that groups tend to be more heterogeneous in the second scenario , highlighted by the prediction of satisfaction with lower values if compared to the first scenario for the outcome of all strategies . Also , it is possible to note that the strategy Average achieved the highest satisfaction values in both scenarios .

The proposed approach has been applied to the development of a real movie recommendation system for groups as a Facebook application . Table 11 displays some statistical information on the usage of the so called MyPopCorn2 group recommendation system , such as the number of users , number of provided movies ratings , number of individual recommendations performed , number of formed groups , and number of movie recommendations generated for groups .

The application has been developed in Python3 with Django4 framework and MySQL5 database . The Apache Mahout6 tool has been also used to provide individual predictions for items . Finally , Nash equilibrium has been achieved by means of the Gambit7 tool . Figure 4 brings a screenshot of one of MyPopCorn ’s pages .

6 . CONCLUSION
In this paper the problem of recommending items to groups of people has been modeled as a noncooperative game . Related work has shown that the resolution of such a conflict by means of a cooperative approach can result in a negotiation failure . In our approach , Nash equilibrium computation is used for rational selection of the set of items to be recommended for the group based on the individual preferences of its members . Group members are self interested players of a noncooperative game in a normal form . The modeling of the recommendation strategy for groups like a noncooperative game meets the need for a balance between satisfying members’ own preferences and avoid the dissatisfaction of other group members , through justice in the recommendation for the group . Furthermore , there will always exist at least one Nash equilibrium , ie , the system can always make a recommendation to the group .
Experiments with a MovieLens dataset have shown satisfactory and promising results in comparison with other state of the art aggregation strategies , such as the Average aggregation strategy , which is widely used in group recommendation research works . Compared to other aggregation strategies , the proposed approach has shown a smaller decrease in the average group satisfaction when the group becomes more heterogeneous and wider . The Equilibrium strategy performs better if compared to the aggregation strategies Least Misery and Plurality Vote under these conditions .
A group recommendation system , called MyPopCorn , has been developed as an application for Facebook . MyPopCorn ’s usage numbers indicates that the application is promising and proves the feasibility of the proposal .
As a future work , we intend to use a dataset from MyPopCorn to evaluate the approach . We also intend to provide an alternative approach based on the cooperative game theory , which compute the Shapley value for the group members in order to proper define the fairest set of recommended item for that group .
