ABSTRACT Measurement studies of online social networks show that all social links are not equal , and the strength of each link is best characterized by the frequency of interactions between the linked users . To date , few studies have been able to examine detailed interaction data over time , and none have studied the problem of modeling user interactions . This paper proposes a generative model of social interactions that captures the inherently heterogeneous strengths of social links , thus having broad implications on the design of social network algorithms such as friend recommendation , information diffusion and viral marketing .

INTRODUCTION
The last few years has seen the arrival of several measurement studies of user relationships and activities on popular online social networks , such as Facebook and Twitter . A common observation made across many platforms is that the presence of a social link connecting two users is a poor estimate of the “ relationship strength ” between them .
To capture strength of social links , recent studies proposed the use of weighted “ interaction graphs , ” weighted graphs where each link is labeled with some measure of interaction frequency [ 3 ] . But these studies focus on a static view of interactions , and therefore only capture a small piece of the picture . The only study to examine changing dynamics of user interactions was performed on Facebook users [ 2 ] , but was limited to a sample set of 60,000 users crawled from a single geographic network .
A deeper understanding of user interactions requires the formulation of a generative model , which can explain properties observed in measured traces of user interactions , or to construct realistic arbitrary sized user interaction traces . Such a model would also be immensely useful to a number of social network applications . For example , it can be used to make more accurate predictions in

In this paper , we seek to fill this void by building a model based on a large detailed trace of user interactions on Renren , the Chinese social network similar to Facebook in functionality . Our trace covers over a year in length , and contains data on the creation of 600+K users , 8+Million new links , and 29+ Million interaction events . The core contribution of this paper is a new generative model that combines the growth of social links with the generation of user interaction events on those links . The preliminary results show that our model could generate the right number of interactions and link strength distributions .
2 . KEY OBSERVATIONS
We analyze of our growth data , and extract three processes that drive dynamics of social interaction during the network formation : Interaction initiation : Users invite new friends to interact at a nearly constant rate . The reason is that interaction requires the further investment of effort ( eg , writing wall posts ) , but people has a finite amount of time to use .
Interaction target selection : Users prefer to interact with friends with whom they share significant overlaps in social circles .
Interaction distribution : Most social links drop in interaction frequency over time as users lose interest in the relationship .
3 . A SOCIAL CO EVOLUTION MODEL
Combining our new observations with previously studied processes of social network evolution , we propose a generative model for social and interaction networks . Our model has two different parts : one is concerned with the evolution of the social network , and the other determines growth of user interactions . We utilize the microscopic evolution model [ 1 ] for generating the social network , because that model is based on observing the temporal properties of large social networks . Microscopic evolution model . The main ideas behind the microscopic evolution model are that nodes join the social network following a node arrival function , and each node has a lifetime , during which it wakes up multiple times and forms links to other nodes . Further details of the model can be found in the paper by Leskovec et al . [ 1 ] . We utilize the following processes :
Node arrival . New nodes Vt,new arrive at time t according to a pre defined arrival function N ( ) Lifetime sampling . At arrival time t , u samples lifetime a from λe−λa , and becomes inactive after time t + a . Let Vt represents set of active nodes at time t .

Social linking : If u wakes up , it creates an edge to others by closing a triad two random steps away . Co evolution model . We augment the social graph model with the interaction processes while we grow the network . Besides befriending with others , nodes also request a certain number of friends to interact with , and distribute interactions over their interaction edges . Algorithm 1 presents our co evolution model , which includes the following interaction processes :
Interaction rate sampling : At arrival time t , u samples interac tion rate ru from exponential distribution with an average of λr .
Interaction initiation : With a fixed probability ru at each time t , u creates an new interaction edge ( u , v , t ) by sending/repling the first wall post along the friendship edge ( u , v ) . u chooses the target v with the prob . proportional to their neighborhood overlap .

Interaction distribution : The system updates the weight we of e , where ne(ne ≥ 1 ) is the an interaction edge e by we = ne/aτ current number of interactions along the edge and ae is the age of e . Then , the system assigns each new interaction to an interaction edge with the prob . proportional to the edge weight .
The interaction evolution part has three simple parameters : The first parameter , λr , controls the tendency of the node invites new friends to interact . The second parameter , τ , is an exponent controls the tendency to stop interacting with a particular friend due to losing interest over time . The final parameter is η , controls the interaction frequency during the interaction process .
4 . PRELIMINARY RESULTS
We now present some preliminary results on the model accuracy . We first fit the right parameter values by measuring Renren social network , as summarized in Table 1 . We then employ the model to evolve a synthetic network from the beginning , and compare the key structure properties of synthetic network with true network at the end of the evolution .
Table 2 shows that the statistics of real/synthetic interaction networks are very similar , demonstrating the co evolution model is able to generate the right number of interactions over the social graph . We testify whether the model could generate the right link strength distribution using the interaction distribution process . Figure 1 shows the distribution of the number of interactions across interaction edges in the true and generated interaction graph , exhibiting a very good match .
