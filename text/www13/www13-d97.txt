ABSTRACT Sentiment classification on tweet events attracts more interest in recent years . The large tweet stream stops people reading the whole classified list to understand the insights . We employ the cotraining framework in the proposed algorithm . Features are split into text view features and non text view features . Two Random Forest ( RF ) classifiers are trained with the common labeled data on the two views of features separately . Then for each specific event , they collaboratively and periodically train together to boost the classification performance . At last , we propose a “ river ” graph to visualize the intensity and evolvement of sentiment on an event , which demonstrates the intensity by both color gradient and opinion labels , and the ups and downs of confronting opinions by the river flow . Comparing with the well known sentiment classifiers , our algorithm achieves consistent increases in accuracy on the tweet events from TREC 2011 Microblogging and our database . The visualization helps people recognize turning and bursting patterns , and predict sentiment trend in an intuitive way .

INTRODUCTION The booming Twitter service attracts more people to post their feelings and opinions on some trending topics or events online . Sentiment analysis plays an import role to help people understand that . Recent sentiment analysis studies show many interests in large scale tweets or blogs [ 1 3 ] . Some studies [ 2 , 3 ] especially focus on the sentiment evolvement of tweet events . However , with poorly designed sentiment visualization , it prevents people to grasp the insights , without reading the large classified list of unstructured tweets . The opinion triangle and ring [ 4 ] used periodic pattern , which is not applicable to visualize the sentiment evolvement of event series . Alper et al . Hao et al . [ 5 ] used pixel cell based sentiment calendars and high density geo maps for visualization . Nevertheless , those visualizations cannot show the dynamics and trend of sentiment over time series .

In our algorithm , we employ co training framework [ 6 ] , and two sentiment classifiers with different view of features are collaboratively and periodically trained on tweet stream . In the visualization phase , we propose a “ river ” graph to intuitively show the sentiment classification results for a tweet event . 2 . CO TRAINING Unlike the product reviews usually companied with a scoring mechanism that quantifies the overall sentiment , tweets lack labeled data . It is a labor intensive task to manually label a large number of tweets , thus we can only annotate a small set of them , and use the semi supervised method to utilize the unlabeled ones to boost the performance . Meanwhile , since a tweet is extremely short , it is necessary to extract more features . Besides the traditional textual features , we also need to explore the nontextual features . Based on the above observations , we design a two view semisupervised method for sentiment classification on tweets , which employs the co training framework . We start to train the classifiers ( cid:1829 ) and ( cid:1829)(cid:2870 ) them on a common set of labeled tweets L , event , ( cid:1829)and ( cid:1829)(cid:2870 ) classify the incoming tweets in a time period t1 , classifiers ( cid:1829 ) and ( cid:1829)(cid:2870 ) , we continue the co training iteratively and ( cid:1868)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , ( cid:1865)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , and ( cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) for each incoming tweet t , which denote the and select confident ones to augment the labeled set L . And we select the p positive tweets and n negative ones , when the classifiers agree most . Several iterations of co training are executed , and output final classification results by multiplying the scores from both classifiers . In the next period , with last trained classifying next tweets in stage t2 . Finally , we obtain the weights and two views of features separately . Then for every specific probabilities that tweet t belongs to the positive , neutral and negative classes . Features are split into two views , ie textual feature and nontextual feature . The textual feature , PMI IR [ 7 ] for each sentiment word w , is computed as :
PMI–IR(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:1864)(cid:1867)(cid:1859)(cid:2870)(cid:4674)(cid:3035)(cid:3047)(cid:3046)(cid:4666)(cid:3050 ) ( cid:3015)(cid:3006)(cid:3002)(cid:3019 ) "(cid:3032)(cid:3051)(cid:3030)(cid:3032)(cid:3039)(cid:3039)(cid:3032)(cid:3047)"(cid:4667)(cid:3035)(cid:3047)(cid:3046)(cid:4666)"poor"(cid:4667 )
( cid:3035)(cid:3047)(cid:3046)(cid:4666)(cid:3050 ) ( cid:3015)(cid:3006)(cid:3002)(cid:3019 ) "(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3042)(cid:3045)"(cid:4667)(cid:3035)(cid:3047)(cid:3046)(cid:4666)"excellent"(cid:4667)(cid:4675 ) ,(cid:1875)(cid:1488)(cid:1842 ) features where hits(• ) is the number of the query results , and P denotes the sentiment dictionary . Here , we use WordNet Affect [ 8 ] for sentiment words . Non textual include emoticons , temporal features , and punctuation . A set of emoticons from Wikipedia are collected as a dictionary , such as : ) , ( >_< ) , >:[ , : ( , :( , etc . People tend to act differently in the morning and the noon , the beginning and ending of a week or month , spring and winter , etc . Thus we classify the post time into different hours , dates , day of week and months as temporal features . Punctuation marks such as exclamation mark ( ! ) , question mark ( ? ) , express the emotional intensity . Thus the term
: ) ,
105 important frequency of each punctuation mark in a tweet is counted for the feature . 3 . SENTIMENT VISUALIZATION There are some the visualization graph , such as graph geometry , layer ordering and coloring , and sentiment words labels . We define density function ρi as the distribution of the number of tweets belonging to sentiment class i . Let the bottom curve function of the visualization graph be S0 . Thus , the upper boundary of the layer of the sentiment class i is Si = S0+∑ ( cid:2880 ) that determine ingredients
( cid:2025 )

Figure 2 . Visualization with ground based ( a ) and symmetric ( b ) graph geometry
By setting function S0=0 and S0=–Sn , we can obtain the groundbased and symmetric geometry as Figure 2 shows . Both graphs depict the activeness of discussion via the height or width . However , ground based graph cannot easily compare the strong and weak between positive and negative sentiments , since their heights are stacked together on the zero line . However , the symmetric graph can grasp the difference through a virtual middle curve through the yellow ribbon . Thus we adopt the symmetric layout around the middle , and mathematically the bottom curve function is derived as the neutral sentiment in
S0= ( cid:2870)∑ ( cid:2880 )
( cid:2025 )
.
Traditionally , there are three sentiment classes . However , such coarse three classes cannot visualize the intensity of people ’s opinions . Thus , we use fine grained segments between 0 and 1 , and color the layers according to the mapping function as follows .
( cid:1833)(cid:1828)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:3421)(cid:4672)(cid:3435)1(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:3439)·255,255,0(cid:4673 ) , ( cid:1868)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:3410)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:3435)255,(cid:3435)1(cid:1868)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:3439)·255,0(cid:3439 ) , ( cid:1868)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 )
In the thoroughly neutral class that p(t ) equals to n(t ) , we simply set the m(t ) = 1 , and p(t ) = n(t ) = 0 . Thus the middle layer color is yellow with a RGB triple ( 255 , 255 , 0 ) . To extract the sentiment labels , we consider the frequency f(w ) and intensity PMI IR(w ) of an opinion word w , and the font size F(w ) of a selected word w is determined as follows , with α as the scaling factor .
F(w ) =α•PMI IR(w)•f(w )
4 . EXPERIMENTS AND CONCLUSION We select four events for evaluation shown in Table 1 , from our database and TREC 2011 Microblogging . With initially labeled data L0 , we train general RF classifiers on two views for cotraining . The accuracies of SVM , standard RF model and cotraining algorithm are given for comparison . It is seen that our algorithm outperforms both well known models , SVM and RF , by achieving 3.8 % improvement on the largest event set . The sentiment visualization results are given in Figure 3 on “ Obama Election ” from June 2008 May 2009 . On the whole , this visualization graph demonstrates that people ’s sentiments about Obama showed different degrees of fluctuation over time , especially when some influential events occurred . For example , Obama defeated John McCain , was officially elected as the 44th
President of the United States and delivered his victory speech , on Nov . 5 , 2008 . And in late January 2009 , he delivered the inaugural address . Besides , the labeled opinion words give the semantic summarization and intensity of sentiment . In the previous work , Thelwall et al [ 2 ] used plain curves of volume and sentiment strength to show the sentiment change . Nguyen et al [ 3 ] used ratios in a rectangle box to show the dynamics of each sentiment polarity on different objects . Compared to [ 3 ] visualizing ratios in a rectangle box and [ 2 ] , our river graph could show rich information that people care , such as the dynamics of volumes , opinion words , and the sentiment strength distribution along the vertically changing colors from warm to cold .
