ABSTRACT Even in the third decade of the Web , scraping web sites remains a challenging task : Most scraping programs are still developed as ad hoc solutions using a complex stack of languages and tools . Where comprehensive extraction solutions exist , they are expensive , heavyweight , and proprietary .
OXPath is a minimalistic wrapping language that is nevertheless expressive and versatile enough for a wide range of scraping tasks . In this presentation , we want to introduce you to a new paradigm of scraping : declarative navigation—instead of complex scripting or heavyweight , limited visual tools , OXPath turns scraping into a simple two step process : pick the relevant nodes through an XPath expression and then specify which action to apply to those nodes . OXPath takes care of browser synchronisation , page and state management , making scraping as easy as node selection with XPath . To achieve this , OXPath does not require a complex or heavyweight infrastructure . OXPath is an open source project and has seen first adoption in a wide variety of scraping tasks .

INTRODUCTION
Web scraping and extraction has long suffered from a dearth of off the shelf tools readily available to web programmers . All too often scraping programs ( “ web wrappers ” ) are still implemented ad hoc using a complex stack of languages and tools . Integrated solutions , of which [ 3 ] and [ 2 ] are prominent examples , are proprietary , heavyweight , and costly .
Therefore , we have introduced OXPath [ 6 ] as a light weight , open source web scraping language and tool . OXPath is designed ∗The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Research Council under the European Community ’s Seventh Framework Programme ( FP7/2007–2013 ) / ERC grant agreement DIADEM , no . 246858 . as a minimalistic extension of XPath that adds just four features to XPath . Nevertheless , it is sufficient for solving many web scraping tasks , as demonstrated in Section 3 . By building on XPath , an established technology widely used for web development , OXPath ’s users can leverage existing tools ( such as as Firebug1 or FirePath2 ) for inspecting a webpage ’s structure and finding suitable XPath expressions for selecting the relevant nodes . OXPath extends XPath with just four concise extensions : ( 1 ) OXPath extends XPath with selection based on HTML specifics and visual features by exposing all CSS properties . For example , //span.price[style::color=’red’ ] selects all span ’s with class “ price ” , if they are also red .
( 2 ) OXPath allows the execution of user actions ( eg , click , form filling ) on selected nodes to interact with the scripted interfaces of web applications . For example , //input#submit/{click } clicks on the input element with id “ submit ” .
( 3 ) OXPath deals with navigation through data paginated over many web sites through bounded or unbounded navigation sequences : ( //a#next/{click /})*//h1 selects all h1 ’s on a page reached by clicking on the a with id “ next ” on the current page P0 , the page P1 reached by such a click on P0 , . . . , the page Pk reached by such a click on Pk−1 .
( 4 ) OXPath enables the identification of data for extraction , which can be assembled into ( hierarchical ) records , regardless of its original HTML structure . These records can be stored in a relational database , as XML or RDF , or processed through a streaming API . Eg , //divresult/span[1]:<price=string()> extracts the string value of each selected node as a “ price ” .
Like XPath , OXPath manages most aspects of the actual evaluation of these expressions automatically , without requiring the user to consider page or state management , browser synchronisation , or network timing . For rare cases , where OXPath ’s built in strategies do not suffice , the user can provide additional hints in form of timeouts or waits after executing an action ( similar to WebDriver ’s explicit and implicit waits ) . All these features are achieved without sacrificing performance : OXPath scales very well both in time and in memory and uses very little resources compared to other web data extraction tools ( for an extensive evaluation , see [ 5] ) . Specifically , its memory requirements are independent of the number of pages visited . This is achieved by aggressive page buffering during a depth first traversal of pages , combined with memoization of intermediate expression results . To the best of our knowledge , OXPath is the first web extraction tool with such a guarantee . Low resource usage is crucial for use as an open information access tool , as it translates into low cost when deployed in the cloud .

Following this brief introduction of OXPath , we demonstrate the ease of use by two examples in Section 2 . OXPath is starting to see use in a number of scraping tasks by a growing group of users . In Section 3 , we briefly sketch some of these user stories to give an idea of the versatility , but also the limits of OXPath . We conclude in Section 4 with an overview of current development plans .
2 . OXPATH BY EXAMPLE
OXPath and its features are best illustrated by means of two examples . Figure 1 depicts the actions necessary to ( 1 ) fill the form on Google Scholar , ( 2 ) navigate through the paginated results , ( 3 ) extract bibliographic information from these pages . At line 2 and 3 , the expression locates the text input and search button fields respectively . On the former , a typing action is performed to fill the value “ world wide web ” (  ) , while on the latter a click is executed to submit the form (  ) . Note the use of OXPath ’s node test field( ) , which is meant to ease navigation among visible fields only . OXPath supports all kind of actions necessary to fill forms , eg , selection of options , checking check boxes , selecting radio buttons .
Figure 1 continues on the result page thus reached . OXPath inherits from XPath the capability to precisely identify nodes on a page , and extends it to specify data for extraction . This is achieved by extraction markers such as :<paper> in line 5 , which creates a record for every paper on that page , each consisting of title and authors attributes specified by attribute extraction markers ( eg , :<title=string( ) ) An important feature of OXPath is the support for extracting nested records . For example , at line 9 a new record marker :<cited_by> is nested in order to extract all citing papers of the <paper> at hand , together with their own attributes ( only <title> shown for brevity ) . Note that , in order to collect all citing papers for the paper at hand , the OXPath expression clicks on the “ Cited by ” link (  ) . Finally , we are able to repeat the actions aforementioned on all result pages , by means of OXPath ’s iteration support . In line 4 (  ) , the expression is performed until matched , hence a click action is executed upon the “ next ” link of each result page .
This simple OXPath expression is thus powerful enough to scrape thousands of results from Google Scholar . OXPath natively supports output as XML , RDF , and into a relational database . As a second example , we show how OXPath can be used to turn web
Figure 2 : OXPath RDF wrapper sites into RDF triples . Figure 2 illustrates an expression that extracts property offerings from http://wwagencycouk , a real estate website in UK .
Lines 1 and 2 are similar to the previous example : form submission and iteration on all result pages . This expression employs RDF extraction markers , that allow to generate both data and object properties including proper type information and object identities . At line 3 , for instance , each match of the extraction marker <:(gr:Offering> produces an object instance of the class Offering in the GoodRelations3 ontology . Lines 4 and 6 specifies data properties hasPrice ( in our own namespace dd ) and foaf:page for this object . At line 7 , the nested marker <gr:includes(dd:House)> has the double effect of creating an object instance of the class dd:House which is related to the current offering object via the specified object property gr:includes . In the next lines , this object is in turn related with several data properties . Namespaces are provided by the environment through a namespace resolver as in XPath .
This wrapper produces RDF triples as below , describing two instances , the first one dd:g31g111 representing a house with 4 bedrooms in Oxford , and the second one dd:g31g109 representing an offer on this house at GBP 475000 . dd:g31g111

3 . OXPATH USER STORIES
OXPath has been employed in several projects , in which it has proved its versatility . In this section we briefly report on ongoing applications , and discuss OXPath ’s strengths and weaknesses in the specific context . DIADEM . DIADEM [ 4 ] is a project at Oxford University on unsupervised domain specific web object extraction . Its goal is to transform unstructured web information into highly structured data without human supervision . DIADEM replaces human annotators in traditional wrapper induction systems by an knowledge about entities ( and relations ) in the domain , and about the representation of these entities in the textual , structural , and visual language of a website of this domain . With this knowledge at hand , DIADEM needs to analyse only a small fraction of a web site to automatically generate ( induce ) an OXPath wrapper that is then executed in the second stage to extract all the relevant data on the site . It is worth mentioning that these wrappers are fairly uniform : They usually start from ( multi stage ) web forms and pass through result pages to the individual real estate listings . We are collecting the OXPath wrappers automatically induced in DIADEM for the UK 3http://purl.org/goodrelations/v1

OXPath is the language of choice for wrappers in DIADEM , as they can be executed at high speed and low cost . However , the experiments carried out so far show that extracting specific parts of a node ’s text is necessary more often as expected , eg , to parse a location into components such as street address , town , and postcode . XPath ’s ( and hence OXPath ’s ) lack of support for such extraction is limiting the precision of the obtained wrappers . DEQA . DEQA [ 7 ] is a project at Leipzig University on a comprehensive deep web question answering system for entire domains , that can answer most of natural language questions on objects only available in form of plain , old HTML websites . In DEQA , OXPath plays the critical role of turning websites into structured RDF data . This RDF data is then enriched , eg , via linking , schema enrichment , geo coding . Eg , in the UK real estate domain , over 100k triples for 2400 properties were extracted and enriched by over 100k links to the Linked Open Data . This allows users to ask questions in a more natural way ( eg , using landmarks rather than coordinates ) . Finally , DEQA first tries to convert a natural language query to SPARQL , yet can fall back to standard information retrieval , where this fails . Lessons learned . OXPath has been positively received in the Linked Open Data community as a valuable tool to quickly produce RDF data . In particular , OXPath proves to be perfectly complemented by recently developed tools for link discovery and enrichment . ARCOMEM . Arcomem [ 8 ] is an European project that aims at developing methods and tools for turning digital archives into community memories . An important part of Arcomem is developed at Telecom ParisTech ( France ) , and focuses on a new applicationaware approach to archival Web crawling . The idea is to use a knowledge base of known web applications ( eg , vBullettin , WordPress ) and their publishing templates , in order to archive only valuable information ( eg , posts , authors , comments ) avoiding duplicates , uninteresting URLs , and presentational templates . This is particularly true for web forums , blogs , and social networks which are the main target of Arcomem . Here , OXPath is employed to ( 1 ) detecting web application types mainly by patterns rules for specific characteristics of the underlying template , eg , “ powered by wordpress ” nodes , ( 2 ) reaching hidden content by performing actions such as clicking on “ show all comments ” or “ read more ” links on posts , and ( 3 ) extracting the relevant data . Lessons learned . This project has provided interesting feedback for improvement . Firstly , OXPath ’s evaluation speed could be drastically increased in all those ( frequent ) cases where the target pages are almost plain HTML , for which the overhead of a real browser and its rendering can be avoided . Secondly , for evidence preservation , archiving necessitates taking screenshots of web pages which is currently not supported in OXPath . Complex ( Web)Events Processing . At University of Linz , OXPath is used to realize an automatic agent for Ebay , based on event condition action rules in a complex event processor ( CEP ) . This agent is capable of determining auctions of interest , monitoring them , and bid if certain conditions , based on rules , are satisfied . Conditions can be complex : for a product auctioned , shopping aggregator websites are queried to determine where to get the product at which price . If the current auction bid is cheaper then the lowest price retrieved the agent places a bid for the product . OXPath has proved to fit well in this context : it is used to detected events on the web ( action found , bid placed , bid won , price found elsewhere ) and to perform the actions ( eg , bidding ) the CEP produces as reactions . Lessons learned . While CEP are designed to process events at very fast rates of thousands per second , web event recognition in troduces a significant latency . Indeed , it is often not practicable to issue web requests at similar pace , which would overtax the target server or lock out the extraction engine . 4 . OXPATH : WHERE NEXT ?
OXPath is continued to be actively developed at Oxford University together with collaborators from all over Europe . We are working on a number of improvements and extensions to OXPath driven by the user stories from Section 3 :
( 1 ) The current public release of OXPath is based on HtmlUnit , a pure and efficient Java browser engine . However , its rendering differs from current browsers and fails for certain heavily scripted cases . Thus , we are currently porting OXPath to Selenium WebDriver , which enables OXPath to access the actual rendering of a page in current browsers . This will also allow to introduce a new action for taking webpage screenshots .
( 2 ) OXPath inherits and improves on XPath ’s strong node selection support . However , the text matching and processing capabilities are limited to those of XPath and not sufficient for more complex cases , such as contextual or approximate matching in product descriptions . We are considering adopting some of the extensions from XPath Full Text 1.0 [ 1 ] .
( 3 ) OXPath ’s output schemata are currently ( possibly nested ) relations of untyped attributes . We plan to improve the support extracting typed data such as numbers , dates or prices .
( 4 ) Every web page reached by an OXPath expression must be rendered in the existing OXPath engine . As shown in [ 6 ] , the rendering time dominates all other aspects of OXPath by a wide margin . Though OXPath is already faster than existing extraction engines , it may still be too slow for large scale archiving or mirroring . To address these scenarios , we are investigating automatic or semi automatic means of determining when the expression may be evaluated on an unrendered DOM .
All these extensions will be contributed to the open source implementation of OXPath implementation available at http://oxpath . org . There we also present an extended list of examples , as well as tutorials on how to use OXPath and how to get involved into developing OXPath further . 5 . REFERENCES [ 1 ] S . Amer Yahia , C .
