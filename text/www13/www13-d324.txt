ABSTRACT Traditionally , trust aware recommendation methods that utilize trust relations for recommender systems assume a single type of trust between users . However , this assumption ignores the fact that trust as a social concept inherently has many aspects . A user may place trust differently to different people . Motivated by this observation , we propose a novel probabilistic factor analysis method , which learns the multifaceted trust relations and user profiles through a shared user latent feature space . Experimental results on the real product rating data set show that our approach outperforms state of the art methods on the RM SE measure .

INTRODUCTION
Recently , several trust aware recommendation methods have been proposed to improve the performance of traditional recommender systems[1][2 ] . Most of them assume that two trusted friends will have similar tastes , and the mutual trust relationships are single and homogeneous .
However , trust as a social concept is intrinsically multifaceted and heterogenous[3][4 ] . Intuitively , a user may trust different people in different domains . For example , in multicategory recommender systems , a user may trust an expert in Movies category while not trust him/her in Cars category . Treat trust relationships of different categories equally will not capture the multi faceted features hidden below the surface .
To solve above problem , we propose to fuse the users’ category information with the rating matrix using a probabilistic matrix factorization method named mTrustMF . We model multi faceted trust and users’ tastes through a shared user latent feature space , ie , the user latent feature space in user categories is the same in the rating matrix . Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state of the art algorithms in terms of RM SE .

2 . RECOMMENDATION FRAMEWORK
In this section , we first introduce the classic trust aware recommendation method SocialMF[1 ] , and then focus on how to model multi faceted trust relation as a regularization term to constrain an extended matrix factorization framework . Suppose we have a m × n rating matrix R = {rij} denoting m users’ numerical ratings on n multi category items . Users can also maintain a trust list , which presents a network S = {sit} of trust relationships between users . Trust aware recommender systems assume that users would always turn to their friends for recommendation since they trust them . For example , SocialMF method tries to derive a high quality l dimensional feature representation U of users by employing the tastes of their trusted friends t ∈ Ni . Let U ∈ Rl×m and V ∈ Rl×n be the inferred latent user and item feature matrices , with column vectors Ui and Vj representing userspecific and item specific feature vectors , respectively . The objective function of SocialMF can be given by : ij ( rij − g(U T I R sitUt)T ( Ui − . t∈Ni
( Ui − . t∈Ni λV 2 where λS , λU , λV > 0 , I R ij is the indicator function that is equal to 1 if user ui rated item vj ; 0 otherwise . g(x ) is the logistic function g(x ) = 1/(1 + exp(−x) ) , fi · fi2 F denotes the Frobenius norm .

The above function makes an assumption that trust relations of different categories have the same influence to the target users . However , as mentioned in Section 1 , trust is multi faceted . In order to reflect the fact that a user ’s multi faceted trust relations will affect his/her decisions on items , we connect user category and user item rating matrix through a shared user latent feature space . The objective function is defined as :

A local minimum of the objective function given by Eq 2 can be found by performing gradient descent in U , V and W .
3 . EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
In this section , we conduct several experiments to compare our approach with two state of the art recommendation methods . 3.1 Dataset and Metric
We use Epinions[4 ] as the data source of our recommendation method , which consists of 22,166 users who have rated 296,277 items in 27 different categories . The total number of issued trust statements and ratings is 355,813 and 922,267 , respectively . In experiments , we choose the commonly used Root Mean Square Error ( RM SE)[5 ] metric to measure the recommendation performance , where lower RM SE means better performance .

3.2 Comparisons
To evaluate the performance of our mTrustMF approach , we compare our method with two popular methods : PMF[6 ] and SocialMF .
Table 1 presents the experimental results on the Epinions data set with different settings of dimensionality K . The parameter settings of our method are λC = 10 , λS = 5 , λU = λV = λW = 30 . From Table 1 , we can observe that the basic PMF method performs worse than the other two trust aware recommendation algorithms , which indicates that purely utilizing users’ preference histories is not suitable . Note that , our mTrustMF approach achieves better performance than SocialMF , which demonstrates that simply treating trust relations equally will not generate satisfactory results , and it is beneficial to learn user features from multi faceted trust relations . 3.3 Impact of Parameter λC
In our method , parameter λC controls how much our mTrustMF approach depends on the user category matrix .
Figure 1 : Impact of Parameter λC ( K=10 )
If λC = 0 , we will simply treat trust relations single and homogeneous for recommendation , and if λC → ∞ , we will only derive latent user feature vectors over categories . In other cases , we fuse information from trust network , usercategory and user item rating matrix for recommendation . Fig 1 illustrates how the changes of λC affect the prediction accuracy . We notice that the value of λC affects the recommendation results significantly , which indicates that incorporating the user category matrix considerably improves the prediction accuracy . As λC increases , the value of RM SE decreases ( prediction accuracy increases ) at first , but when λC surpasses a certain threshold , the RM SE increases ( prediction accuracy decreases ) with further increase of the value of λC . From this experiment result , we observe that purely taking trust relations at face value or purely using the usercategory matrix for predictions cannot generate better results than fusing these resources together .
