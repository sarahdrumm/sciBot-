ABSTRACT Online social networks sampling identifies a representative subnetwork that preserves certain graph property given heterogeneous semantics , with the full network not observed during sampling . This study presents a property , Relational Profile , to account for conditional dependency of node and relation type semantics in a network , and a sampling method to preserve the property . We show the proposed sampling method better preserves Relational Profile . Next , Relational Profile can design features to boost network prediction . Finally , our sampled network trains more accurate prediction models than other sampling baselines .

INTRODUCTION
Online heterogeneous social networks are large scale , with complex semantics having node and relation categories denoting various social roles . One obstacle to effectively utilizing such networks is that it is often impossible to fully access the whole networks . Therefore , we aim to sample a small network , Gs , that approximates the full network G under chosen properties . We propose Relational Profile ( RP ) that stores network ’s transitional probability between node and relation types , and a heuristic sampling strategy . Different sampling methods are tested for RP preservation , and we design RP features for node type and missing relation prediction . Results confirm RP ’s usability , and the superiority of our sampled networks .
Related Work : The two main objectives in network sampling are back in time and scale down goals[3 ] . In the scale down goal , explorative sampling adds nodes sequentially from the neighbors of sampled network in the partially visible network . Topology weighted or pure random walk sampling is used , depending on data[3][6 ] , but they mainly focus on homogeneous network . Works on heterogeneous network examine inter/intra link distribution[4 ] , but transitional probabilities for both node/relation types and usage of semantic subnetworks have not been addressed . 2 . METHODOLOGY
A directed heterogeneous graph G has node set V , relation set E , node and relation type labels N T and ET ( see Figure 1 ’s illustration ) . We define a Relational Profile as follows :
A Relational Profile ( RP ) of a graph G consists four transitional probability matrices ( RM ) between two semantic

Each rij in RM 1 denotes P ( node type j|node type i ) , the probability of a relation with one end node type j given other end node type i . Similarly , RM 2 , RM 3 , and RM 4 represent P ( edge|node ) , P ( node|edge ) , and P ( edge|edge ) type distributions . RP terms come from counting each type transition ( i,j ) ’s occurrence .

Root Mean Square Error ( RMSE ) of the four RM .
For explorative sampling , each node v is sequentially sampled among neighbors of the current Gs , CGs ,k . We propose maximizing information gain due to P by selecting v from D(v ; CGs,k ) = E[ΔP ( Gs , Gs + v)|Obs(v , e) ] , a normalized distribution with observed Gs , v and its connecting edges e . Each step tries to optimize expected property change . We are now ready to introduce RP Preserving Sampling : RP Preserving Sampling(RPS ) : With P = RP , we incorporate semantic type knowledge by maximizing expected change of RP over all node types for adding node v to Gs , D(v ; CGs,k ) = Et[ΔRP ( Gs , Gs + v)|Obs(v , e ) ]

Z is the normalization constant and N ( v ) is the neighboring nodes for v . We use Bayes’ Rule and RP for estimating P ( type(v ) = t|Obs(v , e) ) , and assume conditional independence of node v to all its neighbors in joint type distribution . 3 . EVALUATIONS
Evaluating Property Preservation : We take 3 real life social networks , using the largest connected component :

High Energy Physics ( Hep ) from 2003 KDDCup , Academic ( Aca ) from Taiwan Academic Archive , and Movie networks ( Movie ) from Internet Movie Database , with node numbers 41744 , 63122 , and 40520 , respectively . Two baselines[6 ] are used : High Degree Sampling ( HDS ) for sampling v under D proportional to normalized degree ; Random Walk Sampling ( RWS ) for randomly selecting among Cs,k . All experiments are averaged over 10 runs .
Results of RMSE are shown in Figure 2 , where we sampled until stabilizing . RPS ’s RMSE drops the fastest , using only a small portion of sampled nodes ( 0.8 % to 2.4 % of total ) . We also examined node role approximation using semantically weighted PageRank[7 ] ( LinkFusion ) , calculating the AUC for two weighted node lists for subnetwork and network . RPS is again consistently superior .
Evaluating Network Prediction Tasks : Node Type Prediction is a multi class classification problem , where we predict type(n ) of a node n . Each node in Gs ( node size 500 ) is a training instance and each testing instance randomly selects a node from the rest of the network . Testing size is set to 1000 . Missing Relation Prediction predicts whether an arbitrary semantic relation exists in a graph . Each instance is a pair of nodes , with a relation between them labeled 1 and 1 otherwise . Training set uses Gs with negative instances downsampled to match number of positives . Testing instances are selected to have 10000 each label . Our model uses SVM with linear kernel via LIBLINEAR package[1 ] .
#type(v)=t∀v∈N(n )
Features for model training : We use fdeg(in/out degree , average neighbor in/out degree ) , ftopo(common neighbors , Jaccard Coefficient , Preferential Attachment , Adamic Adar , from [ 5] ) , and fnt(node type distribution , P ( type(n ) = t|n ) = , with node n and its neighbors N ( n ) ) as baselines . For the two Relational Profile features : 1 . fRPnode , the expected type probability density for node n , estimated with RP using the earlier formulation : fRPnode ( n ) : P ( type(n ) = t|n )

Path type probability is estimated with bigram probabilities using P ( type(n2)|type(n1 ) ) = RP ( type(n2)|type(n1) ) . Results : First , compare different sampling methods . Feature sets fRPnode and ftopo+ fRPpath are used to train models for node type and missing relation predictions , respectively . Figure 3 shows Aca result ( for brevity ) , with RPS the better performer . Accuracy reaches asymptote quickly with increasing size . Table 1 shows results with varying feature sets of node size 500 . We find adding P R features universally improve prediction performance , with 5 to 10 % in node type prediction and 2 to 6 % in missing relation prediction .
