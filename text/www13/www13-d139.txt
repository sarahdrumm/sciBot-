ABSTRACT We propose the methods for document , query and relevance model expansion that leverage geographical metadata provided by social media . In particular , we propose a geographically aware extension of the LDA topic model and utilize the resulting topics and language models in our expansion methods . The proposed approach has been experimentally evaluated over a large sample of Twitter , demonstrating significant improvements in search accuracy over traditional ( geographically unaware ) retrieval models .

INTRODUCTION
Social media provides valuable metadata , such as geographical locations of documents and document authors . Additionally , social media documents ( eg , microblog posts ) are becoming increasingly shorter , and thus less likely to contain all the terms as well as topical and geographical aspects of the queries . Therefore , one of the primary goals of microblog retrieval is to bridge the implicit geographical and topical foci of queries and short social media documents . The main idea behind this work is that the missing geo topical aspects of both the information need and potentially relevant microblog documents can be inferred using geographically aware topic models . While several topic models that take into account geographical lexical variation have been recently proposed [ 2 ] [ 3 ] , there has been no prior work studying application of such models to microblog retrieval . We propose a language modeling based probabilistic retrieval framework , which leverages geographical metadata to perform geographically focused document , query and relevance model expansion . While previous studies [ 5 ] have shown that topic modeling can improve retrieval over traditional TREC collections , we demonstrate that incorporating geographically specific topics and language models ( LMs ) derived from them into retrieval methods can effectively address the issues of geographical query ambiguity and short social media documents .

2 . METHOD
Our geographically aware retrieval framework is based on the KL divergence retrieval model with Dirichlet prior smoothing [ 7 ] ( further referred to as KL DIR ) and uses geographically aware topic model ( further referred to as GLDA ) to leverage geographical metadata . Unlike regular topics , which are multinomial distributions over a vocabulary of terms ( ie p(w|t) ) , probabilities of terms in geographically specific topics are also affected by geographical location ( ie p(w|t , l) ) . Since only 1%∼2 % of all microblog posts have explicit geographical coordinates [ 3 ] , all microblog posts in our experimental collection have been labeled with the location of their author taken from the author ’s profile . We obtain geographically specific topics by splitting the original collection into sub collections of microblog posts labeled with each of the considered geographical locations and running LDA [ 1 ] with the same number of topics on each sub collection .
Specifically , we experimentally compare three ways of lever aging geographically specific topics for microblog retrieval : 1 . Document expansion : document expansion LM , p(w| ˆΘD ) , for each document in the collection is interpolated with the original document LM , p(w|ΘD ) , using coefficient α . We propose several different ways of computing p(w| ˆΘD ) : GLDA DEXP STAT : p(w| ˆΘD ) = Pt p(w|t , l)p(t|D ) , where p(t|D ) is the distribution of topics p(w|t , l ) for a microblog post D that are specific to l ( location of the author of D in her microblog profile ) , as determined by GLDA . The intuition behind this method is that p(w| ˆΘD ) should include the terms from the most prevalent geographically specific topics of D . As a baseline , we use the LDA based document LM expansion method ( LDA DEXP STAT ) proposed in [ 5 ] ; GLDA DEXP SUM : p(w| ˆΘD ) = Pl′ p(w|l′)p(l′|D ) = = Pl′ p(w|l′ ) Pw∈D p(l′|w)p(w|D ) , where p(w|l′ ) = Pt p(w|t , l′ ) is a location LM ( which can be interpreted as vocabulary preferences of users in a given geographical location ) and p(l′|w ) = p(w|l′)p(l′ ) is a specificity of word w to location l′ . The intuition behind this method is that instead of using the topics corresponding to l ( location of microblog post D taken from its author ’s profile ) , we can leverage the terms in LM of D that are characteristic of certain locations to calculate p(l′|D ) , the distribution of predicted geographical foci of D , and use the LMs for all locations in p(l′|D ) to form p(w| ˆΘD ) ; GLDA DEXP MAX : p(w| ˆΘD ) = p(w|l′ ) argmaxl′ p(l′|D ) = = p(w|l′ ) argmaxl′ Pw∈D p(l′|w)p(w|D ) . Unlike GLDADEXP SUM , this method uses only the LM of the most likely predicted geographical focus of D to form p(w| ˆΘD ) . p(w )

2 . Query expansion : query expansion LM , p(w| ˆΘQ ) , is interpolated with the original query LM , p(w|ΘQ ) , using coefficient β . We propose several different ways of computing p(w| ˆΘQ ) : GLDA QEXP SUM : p(w| ˆΘQ ) = Pl′ p(w|l′)p(l′|Q ) = = Pl′ p(w|l′ ) Pw∈Q p(l′|w)p(w|Q ) , where p(w|Q ) is the probability of w in the maximum likelihood LM of the original query Q . This method utilizes the location specific query terms to calculate p(l′|Q ) , the distribution of predicted geographical foci of Q ; GLDA QEXP MAX : p(w| ˆΘQ ) = p(w|l′ ) argmaxl′ p(l′|Q ) = = p(w|l′ ) argmaxl′ Pw∈Q p(l′|w)p(w|Q ) . Similar to GLDADEXP MAX , this method uses only the LM of the most likely predicted geographical focus of Q to form p(w| ˆΘQ ) ; LDA QEXP SUM and LDA QEXP MAX : these methods are different from GLDA QEXP SUM and GLDAQEXP MAX in that they use LDA topics p(w|t ) , instead of geographically specific topics p(w|t , l ) .
3 . Pseudo relevance feedback : relevance model ( further referred to as RMOD ) [ 4 ] expansion LM , pRM ( w| ˆΘD ) , is formed by interpolating , pRM ( w|ΘD ) , the original document relevance model , and pGLDA(w|D , Q , l ) with coefficient γ ( RMOD GLDA ) : pRM ( w| ˆΘD ) = = PDi∈R(γpRM ( w|ΘDi )+(1−γ)pGLDA(w|Di , Q , l))×p(Di|Q ) , where pGLDA(w|Di , Q , l ) = Pt p(w|t , l)p(t|Di)p(Q|t , l ) and p(Q|t , l ) = Qw∈Q p(w|t , l ) . As a baseline , we use the method to incorporate LDA into relevance model ( RMOD LDA ) , as proposed in [ 6 ] .
3 . EXPERIMENTS
We used the 2011 TREC Microblog track corpus as the base collection for all experiments in this work . For the purpose of topic modeling , we considered a set of 83 geographical locations ( union of 50 largest and 50 state capital cities in the United States ) and filtered out from the base collection all the tweets , which did not belong to this set , and to compensate for that added new tweets from the considered locations ( however , the original TREC collection was still used for all retrieval experiments ) . We experimentally determined that the optimal performance of KL DIR in terms of MAP is achieved when the Dirichlet prior is set to 200 and that the lowest perplexity for LDA is achieved with 800 topics and for GLDA with 130 topics per each location . The main conclusion based on Figure 1 and Table 1 is that document , query and relevance model expansion methods utilizing geographically specific topics consistently outperform the methods based on standard LDA . Another interesting observation is that leveraging LMs derived from

Table 1 : Summary of the best results for document , query and relevance model expansion methods ( the highest values of performance metrics for each expansion type are highlighted ) . * and † indicate statistical significance relative to no expansion and LDA based expansion baselines respectively with p < 0.05 , according to paired t test . geographically specific topics is more effective for query expansion than for document expansion . This can attributed to the fact that queries are more likely to have geographicallyspecific terms than most of their potentially relevant documents and , thus , the predicted geographical focus of queries is likely to be more accurate . In addition to that , using predicted geographical focus of documents is more effective than assuming that all microblog posts have a fixed geographical focus corresponding to the location of their authors .
