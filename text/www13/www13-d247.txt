ABSTRACT The features available in Twitter provide meaningful information that can be harvested to provide a ranked list of followees to each user . We hypothesize that retweet and mention features can be further and additional/indirect links from within user ’s community . Our empirical results provide insights into the effectiveness of each feature , and evaluate our proposed similarity measures in ranking the followees . Utilizing temporal information and indirect links improves the effectiveness of retweet and mention features in terms of nDCG .

INTRODUCTION One of the challenges for the users of social media , such as in Twitter , is the fast growing number of people each user is following . We evaluate features that refine this list of followees by ranking them based on the similarity of the followees to the user . Existing research that ranks information in social media , in particular in Twitter , has focused on ranking the tweets , ie , the content [ 1][3 ] , and ranking the users [ 2][4 ] globally . We are interested to personalize the ranking of users as it pertains to the community of a given user . We evaluate Twitter features of retweet and mention as ranking functions ; we also introduce two new features , namely indirect retweet , and indirect mention ( section 2 ) . We further utilize the temporal aspect to enhance the performance of features . We provide a comparison in respect to their quality in ranking a user ’s list of followees . 2 . FEATURES & SIMILARITY SCORES We now define each feature and its corresponding similarity score function . Temporal Score : We assume that more recently a tweet is published , more important is the tweet . With this premise , we hypothesize that the time associated to a tweet , ie , published time , affects the similarity score , in measuring the similarity of a user to his/her followees . The interest of a person may change

𝑡𝑐𝑢𝑟−  𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛 +b ( eq .  1 )   during the time ; thus , the importance of the tweet is associated with time . We assign a temporal score to each tweet , which is defined as ,
[ Direct ] Retweet Score ( DR ) : We define a retweet score to capture similarity between a target user and his/her followees . This score considers the retweets stemmed from the followees of a user . That is , the ratio of the number of tweets retweeted from a
                             𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑤𝑘 =𝑎𝑡𝑐𝑢𝑟−𝑡𝑚𝑖𝑛 +1−𝑎𝑡𝐼2−𝑏 where time interval is defined as 𝑡!=𝑡!"#−𝑡!"# ; 𝑡!"# is the 𝑡𝐼 time of the most recent tweet and 𝑡!"# is the time of earliest tweet of the user who publishes the tweet 𝑡𝑤! ; 𝑡!"# is the current time of tweet 𝑡𝑤! ; a and b are experimental parameters , where a<0 ,  0≤𝑏<1 . followee 𝑢! by the target user 𝑢! to the number of all the tweets retweeted by the target user 𝑢! . It is defined as ,                                                              (𝑒𝑞.2 ) 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢!,𝑢! = 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡!!𝑢! 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑤𝑒𝑒𝑡!!𝑢!"" where  retweet!!(u! ) is a function that returns the set of tweets that retweeted by user 𝑢! from user 𝑢! , and retweet!!(u!"" ) returns the entire set of tweets that retweeted by user 𝑢! from all the users in the community of user  𝑢! . target user 𝑢! and his/her followee 𝑢! , we further consider an indirect retweet score . That is , of a target user 𝑢!that have retweeted the same tweet as the target  (eq .  3 ) 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑖,𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑤𝑘          𝐼𝑅𝑢𝑖,𝑢𝑗 =𝑡∗𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑖,𝑢𝑗 + 1−𝑡 𝑡𝑤𝑘 𝑡𝑤𝑘∈𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑗 In ( eq . 3 ) , t<1 ,  retu!,u! is the [ direct ] retweet score between user 𝑢! and 𝑢! defined in ( eq . 2 ) ;  tw! is all tweets that are retweeted from user 𝑢! and  retu!,usertw! retweet score between user 𝑢! and publisher of tw! . 𝐼𝑅𝑇𝑢!,𝑢! =𝑡∗𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢!,𝑢! + 1−𝑡 ∗                                           user has retweeted . We define the indirect retweet score as a function of both [ direct ] retweet score ( first term in equation 3 ) , and summation of scores based on indirect retweet ( second term in eq . 3 ) .
Indirect Retweet with Temporal Score ( IRT ) : To evaluate the effect of temporal feature , we incorporate the temporal score into indirect Retweet ( IR ) score . We call this IRT score and define as ,
Indirect Retweet Score ( IR ) : To capture the hidden potential connection/similarity between a
𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑤𝑘 𝑟𝑒𝑡𝑢𝑖,𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑤𝑘 𝑡𝑤𝑘 we consider the retweets of the other followees in the community
                         (eq .  4 )
!"!∈!"!!! returns the [ direct ] where the first term is the [ direct ] retweet score and the second term is the indirect retweet score which is associating each tweet
[ Direct ] Mention Score ( DM ) : Similar to the retweet feature , we define mention score . We assume that a target user shares similar interest with a followee if s[he ] mentions that followee by using tw! with the temporal score 𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑤! . mention symbol ( @ ) . For user 𝑢! , mention score for user 𝑢! is :                                                                            𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑖,𝑢𝑗 = 𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑢𝑖 𝑢𝑗                                                          (𝑒𝑞.5 ) 𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑢𝑖 𝑢𝑎𝑙𝑙 The mention!!(u! ) returns the set of tweets that mention user 𝑢! by user 𝑢! , and mention!!(u!"" ) returns the entire set of tweets that mention any users by user 𝑢! . 𝐼𝑀𝑢!,𝑢! = 𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑖,𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑤𝑘                                    𝑝∗𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑢!,𝑢! + 1−𝑝 𝑡𝑤𝑘 analogous to indirect retweet , where menu!,usertw! [ direct ] mention score between 𝑢! and publisher of tw! . 𝐼𝑀𝑇𝑢!,𝑢! =𝑝∗𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑢!,𝑢! + 1−𝑝 ∗                                      
The first term is the [ direct ] mention score and the second one is the summation of scores based on indirect mention , defined is the
Indirect Mention Score ( IM ) : Similarly , we take indirect mention into consideration by the same intuition that users who mention a same person may indeed have similarity .
Indirect Mention with Temporal Score incorporating temporal feature to IM score , we define IMT as :
( IMT ) : By
𝑇𝑒𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑤𝑘 𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑖,𝑢𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑤𝑘 𝑡𝑤𝑘
             (𝑒𝑞.6 )
𝑡𝑤𝑘∈𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑗
𝑡𝑤𝑘∈𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑗
                                             (eq  .7 )
Once again , and analogous to IRT , first term is [ direct ] mention score , and the second term is the indirect mention with temporal score . 3 . EVALUATION Dataset : There is no benchmark dataset with user specific relevant judgment for evaluating personalized recommendation research in micro blogging platform . Not only knowing the ground truth of user ’s interest is a difficult task due to the privacy concerns but also a crawled data set may not provide a good coverage of all the potential scenarios . For these reasons , we created our data set by simulating communities of 50 100 followees for 10 target users . The user interests are known apriori ( 10 30 topics of interest ) , based on which we create communities of followees . The probability of two users sharing the same interest is set from 0.2 to 08 To gain a better coverage , we control the probability of following back ( 0.2 1 ) to produce different type of social structures ( Data available upon request ) . Ground Truth : We take advantage of users’ interests to define the realSimilarityu!,u! between users as , 𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑙𝑆𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑢!,𝑢! =|𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑖,𝑢𝑗|2 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑖 ∗𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑢𝑗                          (eq . 8 ) where the commonInterestu!,u! returns the set of interests user 𝑢! and 𝑢! share ; interestu! returns the set of interests of user 𝑢! . According to the realSimilarityu!,u! , we then produce a ranked list , served as a ground truth . We assign the relevant score to each followee of the target user in community according to the followee ’s ranked position in this ranked list as :
                                                                       𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢𝑖 =𝑛+1−𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑢𝑖     ( eq . 9 ) We use commonly used nDCG metrics where IDCG is the DCG score of ideal situation when ranked list is sorted by relevance . Results : We evaluate the effectiveness of retweet and mention features with and without the indirect link and temporal aspect on ranking the followees , in terms of nDCG score . Figure 1 illustrates nDCG of methods based on [ direct ] retweet ( DR ) , indirect retweet ( IR ) and indirect retweet with temporal score ( IRT ) across 10 communities of followees . DR method is improved by 3.5 % using IR method ( 0.88 vs . 0.85 ) , and is further improved by 7.1 % using IRT method ( 0.91 vs . 085 ) Similarly , figure 2 shows the comparison among the [ direct ] mention ( DM ) , indirect mention ( IM ) and indirect mention with temporal aspect ( IMT ) . IM method improves DM by 3.6 % ( 0.84 vs . 081 ) Temporal aspect further improves DM by 7.4 % using IMT ( 0.87 vs081 ) Figure 3 illustrates the average nDCG scores and standard deviations over all 10 tested communities . The results indicate the following ordering among methods : IRT > IR > IMT > IM > DR > DM . Considering standard deviation , IRT ( std : 0.02 ) is shown to be the most stable method , indicating its excellent performance is relatively stable across all the communities .
