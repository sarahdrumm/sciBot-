INTRODUCTION
Trust prediction is the task of inferring trust between pair of users : whether or not a user will build a trust relationship with another user [ 2 ] . One of the most important issues in trust prediction research is how to accurately predict trust between such a user pair that is not apparently in a trust relationship [ 2 , 3 , 4 ] . Previous researchers have undertaken the following approaches according to a viewpoint of the kind of information used in the prediction task .
A natural strategy , an explicit information approach is to use information on explicit trust relations between pair of users , ie , taking only into account users explicitly expressing trust on other users [ 2 , 3 ] . Another approach , an implicit information approach which is often applicable to web sites without explicit trust relations , is to infer trust through user interactions [ 4 ] . User interactions encompass all activities between a user and others such as evaluating writings and making comments on reviews written by others .
Even though considerable studies on trust prediction have been performed , the collective utilization of both explicit trust and user interactions has attracted little attention in the field of computer science . However , the inclusion of user interactions to explicit trust in a unified model would lead to better trust prediction . Hence this paper aims to propose a new trust prediction model that collectively utilizes the two kinds of information , both explicit trust and user interactions , which have been treated separately . 2 . THE PROPOSED MODEL
Let U denote the set of all users and pij denote the probability that ui and uj build trust . When user ui decides that user uj is trustworthy , a trust relationship is formed . In that case , the pair of ui ( called as a trustor ) and uj ( called as a

Specifically , let Rij represent the set of reviews written by user uj and rated by user ui . When ui rates uj ’s reviews , the two users are called a review rating pair , ie , a pair of a review writer and a review rater . Let μij indicate the average of all ratings in Rij .
We examine review ratings to estimate initial trust probabilities between users . Figure 1 shows the change of the numbers of trust pairs and non trust pairs according to the increment of |Rij| . The x coordinate represents |Rij| , and the y coordinate represents the numbers of trust pairs and non trust pairs in comparison . We notice that , when |Rij| is less than 20 , the number of non trusted pairs exceeds that of trust pairs . On the contrary , when |Rij| is greater than 20 , the number of trust pairs is greater than that of non trust pairs . This observation implies that the bigger |Rij| becomes , the more likely trust formation becomes . Motivated by this observation , we use |Rij| in estimating initial trust probabilities p(0 ) ij , which are summarized in Table 1 .

To construct trust propagation strategies used for the proposed model , a trust network needs to be established . We regard users as nodes and the existence of either review ratings between users or trust relations as nodes . The direction of an edge is determined by the direction from a review rater to a reiview writer or from a trustor to a trustee . Initially , each edge has a vector of probabilities , denoted by pij , with the initial probability of ui building trust to uj , denoted by ij , and that of not building trust , 1 − p(0 ) p(0 ) ij . When trust exists between two users , we assign to 1 due to the obvious trust relationship . When only review ratings are available , we set p(0 ) ij as Table 1 suggests .
161 We describe two primary trust propagation strategies in which the proposed new message passing mechanisms , motivated from the idea of belief propagation [ 1 ] , facilitate the integration of explicit trust & review ratings and the prediction of the probability of an edge . We define a source link to be an edge from which a trust message originates and a target link to be an edge to which a trust message is delivered . Thus , we estimate trust degrees of target links after applying the trust message passing mechanisms . For the sake of simplicity , the status of a target link in the following figures is represented by pij .
As the first primary strategy , direct propagation is a trust propagation strategy in which , when ui trusts uk and then uk trusts uj , the probability that ui trusts uj increases by way of uk . Figure 2(a ) explains the direct propagation strategy . When both pik and pkj are greater than 0.5 , we increase the probability that ui trusts uj , pij , to reflect pkj .
As the second primary strategy , when ui trusts uk and also uj trusts uk , transpose trust involves with increasing the probability pij that ui trusts uj by way of uk . Figure 2(b ) explains the strategy of transpose trust . When pik > 0.5 and pjk > 0.5 , pij increases by receiving trust message from pjk . When pjk ≤ 0.5 , the trust relationship between uj and uk does not influence pij .

The following equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) describe the computation of evolving trust degree through the trust messages passing for the two primary strategies , respectively . The trust messages passing , in effect , is realized by a propagation matrix ψ , shown in Table 2 , connecting the status of a source link to that of a target link . Propagation matrix ψ can control the level of connectedness between the two links by parameter .
The equations ( 3 ) describe the computation of trust probabilities for the proposed models ITD . The initial trust probabilites are denoted by I and direct propagation and transpose trust are denoted by D and T , respectively . In the equations , n represents general constants to normalize the message vector because the sum of the elements should be equal to one . The parameter in the propagation matrix is preset through experiments .

In our experiments , we used Epinions dataset1 which has 131,828 users , 841,372 trust relations , and 13,668,319 review ratings . We demonstrated the excellence of ITD by the performance comparison of two previously proposed methods , ABIT L [ 4 ] and MoleTrust [ 3 ] . We empirically found the 1http://wwwEpinionscom parameter , 0.7 and 0.8 for the proposed strategies of direct propagation and transpose trust , respectively , in such a way that accuracy for the training data set is maximized .
To assess the performance of ITD , we basically followed [ 4 ] ; We randomly selected 1,000 user pairs which are trust pairs and review rating pairs at the same time , denoted by Answer set . As for the training , among pairs of users providing information on review ratings , we selected 2,000 pairs : 1,000 pairs in Answer set and random 1,000 pairs of users who have not built trust . Then , using each of the trust prediction models , we estimated trust probabilities for the selected 2,000 pairs .
In the training phase , the initial probabilities , provided in Table 1 , were assigned for the 2,000 pairs . For the user pairs other than the users from the selected 2,000 pairs , p(0 ) ij = 1 is assigned if explicit trust formation exists . Otherwise , the initial probabilities as in Table 1 were assigned .
For each model , the predicted probabilities for the 2,000 pairs are sorted in descending order , and then trust probabilities of the top 1,000 pairs from the sorted list are selected . By comparing the estimated results of the top 1,000 pairs with the 1,000 pairs in Answer set , we computed the accuracy of the model , which is a ratio of the number of correct pairs to 1000 . For ITD , ABIT L , and MoleTrust , the abovestated testing was repeated five times , and the average was used for the model ’s accuracy .
Table 3 shows the accuracy of the trust prediction models as well as the used weights in ITD , αI , αT , and αD , which maximized the accuracy . The accuracy of ITD is higher than that of ABIT L and MoleTrust by 12.5 % and 29.1 % , respectively . The result is not surprising because , while the ABIT L model relies on user interactions and the MoleTrust model depends on information on explicit trust , the proposed ITD model takes into account information on both user interactions and explicit trust .
