ABSTRACT Efforts such as Wikipedia have shown the ability of user communities to collect , organize and curate information on the Internet . Recently , a number of question and answer ( Q&A ) sites have successfully built large growing knowledge repositories , each driven by a wide range of questions and answers from its users community . While sites like Yahoo Answers have stalled and begun to shrink , one site still going strong is Quora , a rapidly growing service that augments a regular Q&A system with social links between users . Despite its success , however , little is known about what drives Quora ’s growth , and how it continues to connect visitors and experts to the right questions as it grows . In this paper , we present results of a detailed analysis of Quora using measurements . We shed light on the impact of three different connection networks ( or graphs ) inside Quora , a graph connecting topics to users , a social graph connecting users , and a graph connecting related questions . Our results show that heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are significant contributors to the quality of Quora ’s knowledge base . One drives the attention and activity of users , and the other directs them to a small set of popular and interesting questions .

The Internet is a maelstrom of information , most of it real , and much of it false . Efforts such as Wikipedia have shown that collectively , Internet users possess much knowledge on a wide range of subjects , knowledge that can be collated and curated to form valuable information repositories . In the last few years , community question and answer ( Q&A ) sites have provided a new way for users to crowdsource the search for specific detailed informaCopyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee ( IW3C2 ) .

INTRODUCTION tion , much of which involves getting first hand answers of specific questions from domain experts . While these sites have exploded in popularity , their growth has come at a cost . For example , the first and still largest of these sites , Yahoo Answers , is showing clear signs of stalling user growth and stagnation , with traffic dropping 23 % in a span of four months in 2011 [ 23 ] . In addition , the Google Answers service launched in 2001 was already shut down by 2006 . Why is this the case ? One of the prevailing opinions is that as sites grow , a vast number of low value questions overwhelm the system and make it extremely difficult for users to find useful or interesting content . For example , ridiculous questions and answers are so prevalent on Yahoo Answers that a quick Google search for “ Yahoo Answers Fail ” turns up more than 8 million results , most of which are sites or blogs dedicated to documenting them . Bucking the trend thus far is Quora , an innovative Q&A site with a rapidly growing user community that differs from its competitors by integrating a social network into its basic structure . Various estimates of user growth include numbers such as 150 % growth in one month , and nearly 900 % growth in one year [ 23 ] . Despite its short history ( Quora exited beta status in January 2010 ) , Quora seems to have achieved where its competitors have failed , ie successfully drawing the participation of both a rapidly growing user population and specific domain experts that generate invaluable content in response to questions . For example , founders of Instagram and Yelp answered questions about their companies , Stephen Fry and Ashton Kutcher answered questions about actors , and domain specific answers come from experts such as Navy Seals sharpshooters and San Quentin inmates . So how does Quora succeed in directing the attention of its users to the appropriate content , either to questions they are uniquely qualified to answer , or to entertaining or informative answers of interest ? This is a difficult question to answer , given Quora ’s own lack of transparency on its inner workings . While it is public knowledge that Quora differs from its competitors in its use of social networks and real identities , few additional details or quantitative measures are known about its operations . A simple search on Quora about how it works produces numerous unanswered questions about Quora ’s size , mechanisms , algorithms , and user behavior . In this paper , we perform a detailed measurement study of Quora , and use our analyses to shed light on how its internal structures contribute to its success . To highlight key results , we use comparisons against Stack Overflow , a popular Q&A site without an integrated social network . We seek to answer several key questions :
• What role do traditional question topics play in focusing user attention ? How much do followers of a topic contribute to answering its questions ?

Figure 1 : Structure of questions , topics and users in Quora .
• What impact do super users have on specific patterns of user activity ? Can they generate and focus user attention on individual questions , thus setting them apart from questions on related topics ?
• Given the rapid growth of questions on question and answer sites , how does Quora help users find the most interesting and valuable questions and avoid spammy or low value questions ? What role do the “ related questions ” feature play ?
Our analysis reveals interesting details about the operations of Quora . We find that while traditional topic followers generate traffic , social relationships help bring a significant amount of answers to questions , and generally provide much higher quality answers than strangers . Most surprisingly , we find that the related question graph plays a significant role in funneling user traffic and attention to key questions on a given topic . It exhibits a power law structure where the degree of a question correlates strongly with the number of views and answers it receives . Finally , we use graph partitioning to identify clusters of related questions in the graph , and find that the large majority of viewers and answers focus on very few questions within each cluster . This further supports our hypothesis that Quora ’s social graph and question graph have been extremely effective at focusing user attention and input on a small subset of valuable questions . 2 . BACKGROUND Quora is a question and answer site with a fully integrated social network connecting its users . In this section , we introduce Quora , using Stack Overflow as a basis for comparison . We then give details on the key Quora graph structures that connect different components together . Specifically , we describe three types of graphs in Quora : a social graph connecting users , a user topic following graph and a related question graph . 2.1 Quora and Stack Overflow Quora . Quora is a question and answer site where users can ask and answer questions and comment on or vote for existing answers . Unlike other Q&A sites where all users exist in a global search space , Quora allows users to follow each other to form a social network . Social connections in Quora are directional like Twitter . A user A can follow user B without explicit permission , and B ’s actions ( new questions , answers , comments and topics ) will appear in A ’s activity stream . We say A is B ’s follower and B is A ’s followee . In addition , users can follow topics they are interested in , and receive updates on questions and answers under this topic . Each Quora user has a profile that displays her bio information , previous questions and answers , followed topics , and social connections ( followers and followees ) . Each user has a “ Top Stories ” page , which displays updates on recent activities and participated questions of their friends ( followees ) , as well as recent questions under the topic they followed . A small subset of registered users are chosen by Quora to be reviewers and admins , and have the power to flag or remove low quality answers and questions . Finally , each Quora question has its own page , which includes a list of its answers and a list of related questions . Users can add new answers , and comment , edit and vote on existing answers . Stack Overflow . Stack Overflow is another successful Q&A site started in 2008 . Stack Overflow differs from Quora in two main aspects . First , while Quora covers a broad range of general topics , Stack Overflow focuses specifically on computer programming questions . Second , users in Stack Overflow are fully independent and no social connections exist between users . 2.2 Graph Structures In Quora The internal structure of question and answer sites are often a complex mix of questions , answers , question topics , and users . We summarize the relationships between different entities in Figure 1 . Users can follow individual topics and other users for news and events ; questions are connected to other “ related ” questions , and each question can be tagged with multiple topics . Finally , for each question in the system , there is a user who asked that question ( the asker ) , users who answered that question ( answerers ) , and users who voted on an answer ( voters ) . Quora ’s internal structure is dominated by three graphs that act as channels that guide user interest and deliver information to users . 1 . User Topic Graph : Quora users follow different topics , and receive updates about questions under topics they follow . 2 . Social Graph : Quora users follow each other to form a Twitterlike social graph . Users receive newsfeed about questions their friends participated in . 3 . Question Graph : Each question has a list of related questions used by users to browse related questions . The “ related ” relationship is considered symmetric .
We believe these three graphs are largely responsible for guiding the attention of Quora users . In this paper , we will perform detailed analysis on these graphs to understand how they impact user activities , especially how they help users separate a small subset of interesting questions from the larger number of less interesting questions/answers . 3 . DATASET AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS Before diving into main analytical results of our work , we begin in this section by first describing our data gathering methodology and presenting some preliminary results . Here we describe the properties and limitations of our Quora and Stack Overflow datasets . We also analyze some high level metrics of the Quora data , while using Stack Overflow as a baseline for comparison . 3.1 Data Collection Our analysis relies on two key datasets . A publicly available dataset periodically released by Stack Overflow , and a dataset crawled

Figure 2 : Questions growth . from Quora that contains multiple groups of data on users , questions , topics and votes . We describe details below . The basic statistics of both datasets are shown in Table 1 . Stack Overflow . Stack Overflow periodically releases all of their data to the public . Our site trace was released in August 2012 , and covers all activity on Stack Overflow between July 2008 and July 2012 . Quora . We gathered our Quora dataset through web based crawls between August and early September 2012 . We tried to follow crawler etiquette defined in Quora ’s robotstxt Limited portions of data were embedded in Ajax calls . We used FireWatir , an open source Ruby library , to control a FireFox browser object , simulating clicking and scrolling operations to load the full page . We limited these crawls to 10 requests/second to minimize impact on Quora . Since Quora has no predefined topic structures for its questions ( questions can have one or more arbitrary topic “ labels ” ) , getting the full set of all questions is difficult . We followed the advice from a Quora data scientist [ 3 ] and start our question crawls using 120 randomly selected questions roughly evenly distributed over 19 of the most popular question topics . The crawls follow a BFS pattern through the related questions links for each question . In total , we obtained 437,000+ unique questions . Each question page contains the topics associated to the question , a complete list of answers , and the answerers and voters on each answer . As shown in Table 1 , this question based crawl produced 56,000+ unique topics , 979,000+ answers , and 264,000+ unique users who either asked or answered a question , or voted on an answer . Our biggest challenge is trying to understand how much of the Quora dataset we were able to gather . The simple answer is we don’t know , since there are no official quantitative measures about Quora available . But we found a post by a Quora reviewer [ 2 ] that hinted the question ID ( or qid ) in Quora is sequentially assigned . Thus we can infer the total number of questions by inspecting the qid of the newly added questions . To validate this statement , we performed several small experiments where we added small bursts of new ( meaningful ) questions to Quora . Each burst contains 10 new questions sent seconds apart , and consistently produced 10 sequential qid ’s . We separated experiments by at least 30 minutes , and observed increments to the qid consistent with the expected number of new questions in the gap between experiments . Finally , we plotted qid values for all questions found by our crawl and correlated them with the estimated date of question creation . The result , discussed below , provides further support that this qid can be used as an estimate of total questions in the system . The largest qid from our crawled questions is 761030 , leading us to estimate that Quora had roughly 760K questions at the time of our crawl , and our crawl covered roughly 58 % of all questions . Note that not all questions remain on the site , as Quora actively deletes spam and redundant questions [ 5 ] . This estimate might provide an upper bound i s c p o T f o r e b m u N

Stack Overflow C# Java PHP Javascript Android jquery iPhone C++ ASP.net .net of actual number of questions , and our coverage of 58 % would be a lower bound . We also crawled the user profiles for users extracted from the crawled questions . Each user profile contains 6 parts : the list of the user ’s followers , list of users they follow ( followees ) , their previous answers , their previous questions , their followed topics and boards . Out of the 264K extracted users , we found that roughly 5000 ( 1.9 % ) profiles were no longer available , likely deleted either by Quora or the user . Qid Over Time . Assuming we are correct about the use of qid , we can plot an estimate of the growth of Quora ( and Stack Overflow ) , by plotting qid against time . Since Quora does not show when a question is posted , we estimate the posting time by the timestamp of its earliest answer . For open questions with no answer , we infer the question posting time based on the latest activity timestamp on the question page . Since reading the question does not update this “ latest activity ” timestamp , this timestamp can estimate posting time for unanswered questions . We estimate the total number of questions in Quora for each month by looking at the largest qid of questions posted in that month . For Stack Overflow , we use the timestamp for questions creation in the data trace . We see in Figure 2 that Stack Overflow is an older site with more questions than Quora . We plot two lines for Quora , a black dashed line for the total number of questions estimated by qid , and the blue dashed line is the number of questions we crawled from each month . Both lines increase smoothly without gaps , suggesting that Quora did not reset qid in the past and the questions we crawled are not biased to a certain time period . Our estimated number of questions in Quora for June 2012 is 700K , which is consistent with previously reported estimates [ 24 ] . As Quora continues to grow , it is clear that helping users easily identify and find the most meaningful and valuable questions and answers is a growing challenge . 3.2 Initial Analysis Topics . Quora is a general Q&A site with a very broad range of topics . We observed 56K topics in our dataset , which is twice more than that of Stack Overflow , even though Quora is smaller by

Figure 8 : Votes for the best answer vs . average . the
Figure 9 : # of Questions per user .
Figure 10 : # of Answers per user . question count . Table 2 lists the top 10 topics with most number of questions in each site . In Quora , the top 10 includes topics in various areas including technology , food , entertainment , health , etc . “ Startups ” is the most popular one which takes 3.7 % of the questions . While all topics in Stack Overflow are different , they are all related to programming . The most popular topic is “ C# , ” which represents roughly 10 % of all questions . Figure 3 plots the distribution of number of questions per topic in Quora in a log log grid . It shows that for the large majority of topics , each topic contains only a handful of questions , while a few popular topics are responsible for most of all questions . The distribution of number of questions per topic mirrors a power law distribution . Performing a power law fitting produces alpha value 2.28 with error 003 Questions and Answers . In both systems , one question can have multiple topics . Figure 4 shows the number of topics per question . Stack Overflow requires a minimum of 1 topic and a maximum of 5 topics per question , and the results are evenly distributed between 1 and 5 . Although Quora does not have such requirements , a majority ( 85 % ) of questions have no more than 5 topics . Very few ( <1 % ) of questions end up with more than 10 topics , which might be an attempt to draw more attention to the question . Next , we plot the distribution of views and answers per question in Figure 5 and Figure 6 . We are surprised to find that the curves from Stack Overflow and Quora are nearly identical . Although 20 % of questions in Quora remain unanswered ( 10 % for Stack Overflow ) , almost all questions got at least 1 user view . In addition , 99 % of questions end up with less than 10 answers , and 20 % of all Quora questions managed to collect ≥4 answers . We use this as a minimum threshold for our later analyses on social factors on system performance . In terms of votes , both Quora and Stack Overflow allow users to upvote and downvote answers . Quora makes visible the list of upvoters , but hides downvoters . Downvotes are processed and only contribute to determining the order answers appear in . Thus in our analysis of Quora , we only refer to upvotes and disregard downvotes . In contrast , Stack Overflow anonymizes all voters and only displays the accumulated number of votes , which can be negative if an answer is poorly received . We plot the distribution of votes per answer in Figure 7 . There is still a fairly big portion of answers ( about 40 % for both sites ) that received no votes from users . Next , we look at how votes impact the order that answers are displayed . Quora uses a proprietary algorithm [ 1 ] to rank the answers , where best answers show on the top of the page . In Stack Overflow , the question asker can accept one of the answers as the best answer . First , we examine how well votes work to identify the “ best answer . ” We select questions with at least 2 answers , 180K or 40 % of all questions in Quora and 1.76M or 51 % in Stack Overflow . Figure 8 plots the ratio of the best answer’ votes over the average votes per answer under this question . We call this as “ best answer vote ratio . ” Overall , vote count was very effective at identifying the best answers , and the differences between the two sites might be explained by the more concrete ( right or wrong ) nature of Stack Overflow ’s questions compared to general questions on Quora . Surprisingly , some of the best answers have less votes than the average answer . 5 % of Quora questions ranked answers with fewer upvotes on top , likely due to other features used by Quora ’s ranking algorithm such as answerer reputation or downvotes . On Stack Overflow , 7 % of the answers chosen by the asker had lower votes than average . Finally , we note that both sites use crowdsourcing to moderate user generated content . Stack Overflow has administrators who actively flag unqualified questions and close them [ 4 ] . Roughly 3 % of all questions in Stack Overflow have been closed , and Figure 11 shows the reasons why they were closed . The top two reasons were “ not real , ” ie ambiguous , vague , incomplete , overly broad or rhetorical , and redundant questions . In contrast , Quora relies on a total of 43 admins and 140 reviewers chosen from the user population to flag low quality answers and redundant questions [ 6 , 7 ] . The number of flagged or removed answers and questions is unknown . While it is unclear whether these reviewers are responsible for keeping Quora largely free of fake or scripted accounts ( Sybils ) [ 37 , 39 ] , recent work has shown that human reviewers can be extremely effective at detecting fake or forged content [ 36 ] . Users Activity . Finally , we compare levels of user activity in Quora and Stack Overflow . Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the

Figure 11 : Reasons for deleting questions in Stack Overflow .
Figure 12 : Topics followed per user .
Figure 13 : Average views and answers for questions under sorted topic buckets . total number of questions and answers posted by each user . 60 % of Stack Overflow users did not post any questions ( or answers ) , while less than 1 % of active users post more than 1000 questions ( or answers ) . We observe similar trends in Quora . 40 % of the users in our dataset did not post any answers , and 70 % of the users have not asked any questions , indicating that a small portion of users have contributed most of the content . Summary . Despite their different topics of interest , Quora and Stack Overflow share many similarities in distribution of content and activity . A key observation is that given the broad and growing number of topics in Quora , identifying the most interesting and useful content , ie separating the wheat from the chaff , is a very difficult problem . Without built in mechanisms to lead users to useful content , the service will overwhelm users with the sheer volume of its content , much like the Internet itself . This is the focus of the rest of our paper , where we will study different Quora mechanisms to understand which , if any , can keep the site useful by consistently guiding users to valuable information . 4 . THE USER TOPIC GRAPH Quora allows users to track specific fields by following the corresponding topics , such as “ Startups , ” “ Facebook , ” and “ Technology . ” This also directly connects users to questions ( and associated answers ) . A question , once created or updated under a topic , will be pushed to the newsfeeds of users who follow the topic . In this section , we model the interaction between Quora users and topics using a user topic graph , and examine the impact of such interactions on question answering and viewing activities . Specifically , we seek to understand whether there is a direct correlation between followers of a topic and views and answers to questions , ie do highly followed topics draw a large number of views and answers to their questions ? 4.1 High level Statistics We first examine the number of topics followed by each user1 . Figure 12 shows the cumulative distribution of the number of topics followed per user . We make three key observations . First , the large majority ( 95 % ) of users have followed at least 1 topic . This is because Quora recommends topics during the sign up process . Second , Quora users each tend to follow a moderate number of topics , eg more than 50 % of users followed at least 10 topics , but 97 % of users followed no more than 100 topics . Finally , a very small portion of users ( 27 or 0.01 % ) followed more than 1000 topics . We manually checked these users and found that they were legitimate accounts , and come from various backgrounds such as CEOs , cofounders , bloggers , students , and were all very active Quora users . 1The user topic interaction is one way where users can follow multiple topics , but the relation is asymmetric , ie topics do not follow users .

Table 3 : Top 10 topics in Quora based on number of followers .
Next , we rank the topics by the number of followers . Since each Quora user lists the topics she follows in her profile , we estimate the number of followers by examining user profiles in our crawled dataset . Out of 56K topics crawled , 35K topics have at least 1 follower in our dataset . Using these estimates , we list in Table 3 the top 10 topics with the most followers . Clearly , users were highly biased towards certain topics . For example , “ Startups ” was followed by nearly 18 % of users , and “ Venture Capital ” by 5 % of users . More interestingly , when compared to Table 2 ranking topics by number of questions , only 4 topics ( “ Startups ” , “ Facebook ” , “ Google ” , and “ Music ” ) are in the top 10 of both rankings . This shows that a high level of interest in a topic , ie more followers , does not necessarily produce more questions . 4.2 Impact on Question related Activities We now examine whether user interest towards certain topics translates into higher level of activities on questions related to those topics . We examine the correlation between the number of views or answers per question , and the number of followers of each topic . Since the number of topics is large ( 35K ) , we bucketize topics based on the number of followers in a log scale . For example , topics with number of followers in the range [ 1 , 10 ] are in one bucket , and topics with number of followers within [ 10 , 100 ] are in a second bucket . We have a total of 5 buckets . In each bucket , we compute the number of views ( answers ) per question , averaged over the topics and their questions . Figure 13 shows the correlation results for both question views and answers . We observe a strong correlation : questions under topics with more followers tend to have a higher number of average page views and answers . This is intuitive : when a user follows a topic , all questions under the topic and their updates show up on the user ’s newsfeed , thus encouraging page views and answers . We verify this intuition by examining for each question the percentage of answers that came from followers of the question ’s topic(s ) . Unfortunately we could not do the same for question page views , because Quora only reveals the identity of users who answer questions , but not those who browse each question . We focus on questions with some minimum number of user interactions ( ≥4 answers ) , which filters out all but 87K ( 20 % ) questions from our

It is very close to a uniform distribution with mean of 50 % , except for roughly 13 % of questions , for which none of the answers were produced by followers of the question ’s topic(s ) . At a high level , this suggests that topics are effective ways of guiding users towards questions that are valuable and appealing to them . Summary . The user topic interaction has considerable impact on question answering activities in Quora . Not surprisingly , questions under well followed topics generally draw more answers and views . Following the right topics can introduce users to valuable questions and answers , but is not the only way to access questions . 5 . THE SOCIAL GRAPH In addition to following topics of interest , Quora users also follow each other to form a Twitter like directed social graph . Questions that a user interact with are dissiminated to their followers in the form of events in their newsfeed . Therefore , social relationships clearly affect Q&A activities , and serve as a mechanism to lead users to valuable information . In this section , we analyze the Quora social graph to understand the interplay between user social ties and Q&A activities . Specifically , we seek to answer three key questions . First , what triggers Quora users to form social ties ? Second , does the presence of popular users correlate with high quality questions or answers ? That is , do questions raised by “ super users ” with many followers receive more and/or better answers from her followers ? Finally , do strong social ties contribute to higher ratings on answers to questions ? In other words , do questions answered by super users get more votes because of the sheer number of their followers ? 5.1 Social Ties We begin by examining the follower and followee statistics of Quora users . Figure 15 plots the complementary cumulative distribution function ( CCDF ) for both the incoming degree ( follower ) and outgoing degree ( followee ) . As expected , the degree distribution follows the power law distribution [ 10 ] . Specifically , 23 % of users have no followers and 23 % do not follow anyone . The vast majority of users ( 99.6 % ) have less than 1000 followers , while 23 users have more than 10,000 followers . The exponential fitting parameter α for the incoming degree distribution is 2.49 ( with fitting error 001 ) This is very close to that of Twitter ( α=2.28 ) , but higher than that of Facebook and Orkut ( α=1.5 ) [ 38 , 26 ] . Figure 16 plots the distribution of the follower followee ratio ( FFRatio ) , the ratio of a user ’s incoming and outgoing degrees . In our data set , 44,091 ( 17 % ) of all users have neither followers nor followees ( and are thus removed in this particular analysis ) . For the rest , 6 % of users have no followers , and 7 % do not follow anyone , representing the two extremes in the FFRatio distribution . Overall , more than half ( 58 % ) of all users have more followees than followers . A very small portion ( 0.1 % ) have 100 times more followers than followees . Not surprisingly , these are mostly celebrities , eg editors , actors and CEOs . Triggers of Social Ties . To understand how Quora ’s social network functions , a basic question of interest is how users choose their followees . According to a recent survey of Quora users [ 31 ] , they tend to follow users who they consider interesting and knowledgeable . Thus our hypothesis is that , outside of the small portion of celebrities who get followers just by their mere presence , the majority of Quora users attract followers by contributing a large number of high quality answers . To validate our hypothesis , we examine the correlation between a user ’s follower count and the quantity and quality of her answers to questions . We approximate the quality of an answer by the number of votes received . We put users with the same number of answers ( votes ) into a group and compute the average number of followers per user for each group . Figure 17(a ) plots the correlation results , which confirm our hypothesis . The correlation is particularly strong for users with less than 100 followers , which account for 91 % of the users in our dataset . 5.2 Impact on Question Answering Quora is unique because it integrates an effective social network ( shown above ) into a tradition Q&A site .

Figure 20 : Ranking answers by author popularity vs top answer selected by Quora .
Figure 21 : Votes from answerer ’s followers . understand how social ties affect Q&A activities . Specifically , we explore whether super users ( or users with many followers ) draw more and better answers from their followers . To answer this question , we first examine for each question the number of answers , and the portion of answers coming from the asker ’s followers . We then measure the quality of answers based on votes and explore whether followers provide better answers . We define “ Super User ” as top 5 % of all users by followers . In our dataset , we have 12K super users , each with more 160 followers . For questions in our dataset , the asker is not shown on the question page . Instead , we match the originator of the question ( the “ asker ” ) to each question based on user profiles . Each user ’s profile page contains a list of user ’s previously asked questions . Using this list , we managed to find the askers for 285K ( 65 % ) questions in our question dataset . Since our analysis targets user social activities in the question thread , we do not consider open questions and questions that have not gained enough answers . We only consider questions with known askers and at least 4 answers , which still leaves a large number of questions ( 59K ) for our analysis . Number of Answers . In Figure 6 we have plotted the distribution of the number of answers received per question across all the questions . We repeat this analysis for both questions raised by super users and non super users ( regardless of the number of answers received ) , and found that they follow the same distribution ( figure omitted due to the space limitations ) . This shows that users do not get more answers for questions just by having more followers . Answers by Followers . Next , we examine for each question the portion of answers contributed by the asker ’s followers . Figure 18 plots the cumulative distribution across all the questions ( marked as “ All ” ) , across the questions raised by super users ( “ Super User ” ) , and across the questions raised by non super users ( “ Normal ” ) . We make two key observations . First , a big portion of the questions ( 68 % for “ All ” ) did not receive answers from the asker ’s followers . Even half of the questions raised by super users received no answers from their followers . This is likely because users who follow someone tend to seek her ( helpful ) answers to questions , rather than looking for questions to answer . This also implies that if we build a Q&A site solely as a social network that expects answers only from friends ( followers ) , most questions will remain unanswered . Second , compared to normal users , super users do draw more answers from their followers , indicating a moderate level of social influence on question answers . We also compare the effectiveness of drawing answers using social ties to that of drawing answers from following topics ( discussed in Section 4 ) , by comparing the results in Figure 18 and Figure 14 . We see that in general , questions received more answers from users who follow the associated topic(s ) . But neither channel appears to be the primary way of attracting answers , and both channels appear to complement each other in this process .
Answer Quality . We now examine whether answers contributed by the asker ’s followers have better quality . Again we use the number of votes received to serve as an approximate measure of the quality of an answer . For each question thread , we first compute the average votes per answer for all the answers Vall and for all the answers contributed by the asker ’s followers Vf ollower . We define R = Vf ollower as the relative quality of the followers’ answers . Thus R > 1 indicates that the followers’ answers are of higher quality in general . Figure 19 shows the cumulative distribution of R , where for more than 50 % of the questions , answers from the followers were of higher quality , and for 20 % of the questions , answers from the followers got more than 2 times the votes than average . This result is consistent with a recent survey study [ 27 ] on Q&A behaviors in Facebook , which suggests that close friends have stronger motivation to contribute good answers .

5.3 Impact on Voting Quora applies a voting system that leverages crowdsourced efforts to promote good answers . By positioning good answers at the top of the questions page , Quora allows users to focus on valuable content . However , the social interaction among Quora users could impact voting in various ways . The key concern is users who have many followers can get their followers to vote for their answers , thus gaining an “ unfair advantage ” over other users . In the following , we study this issue in detail by exploring two key questions . First , do user votes have a large impact on the ranking of answers in Quora ? Second , do super users get more votes , and do these votes mainly come from their followers ? Votes and Ranking . Quora has indicated that the number of votes is the key metric to determine quality of answers [ 1 ] . In fact , our results in Figure 8 show that more than 96 % of the best answers ( ranked 1st by Quora ) received more votes than average . Thus our goal is to explicitly examine how much the number of votes matters in Quora ’s ranking algorithm , and whether social connections give user advantage to gain more votes . For each question thread , we start by ranking the answers by the number of votes received . Answers with the most votes are ranked first . We then take the best answer ( ranked 1st ) chosen by Quora ’s built in algorithm and study their vote based ranking . Figure 20 plots the cumulative distribution of these best answers’ vote based ranking . We see that for 85 % of the questions , Quora ’s best answers also ranked the highest in votes , and for 96 % of the questions , the best answers from Quora are among the top 2 most votes . This result confirms that the number of votes is the dominating feature for selecting best answers . The same result also implies that potential bias in the voting process could lead to unfair ranking of answers , which we study next .

Votes on Super Users . We repeat the above analysis on answers offered by super users ( most followed users ) . Results in Figure 20 show that for 40 % of questions , super users’ answers received the highest votes , and for 60 % of cases , their answers are among the top 2 most votes . This implies that regardless of the quality of their answers , super users can often get more votes over other users . To better understand the bias , we examine whether a large portion of votes come from the answerer ’s followers . For this we gather answers to all the questions and group them by the number of votes received . For each group of answers , we compute the average percentage of votes from the answerer ’s followers . We also repeat the same process on answers offered by super users and those from non super users . Figure 21 shows the average percentage of followers’ votes across different answer groups . We cut the line at the points where the number of votes reaches 100 , which covers 99.9 % of all answers ( see Figure 7 ) . These results show that answers contributed by super users do receive a large portion of votes ( 30 40 % ) from their followers , which is significantly larger than normal users ( <10% ) . This shows that users with more followers tend to get more votes from their followers , which could introduce potential unfairness in answer ranking . For example , an answer contributed by super users gets a much higher rank even though the true quality of the answer is not high . Summary . In Quora , users who contributed more and good answers tend to have more followers . These well connected users also gain advantage by having more friends ( followers ) to answer their questions and upvote for their answers . 6 . THE RELATED QUESTIONS GRAPH One of Quora ’s core features is the ability to locate questions “ related ” to a given question . This effectively creates a related question graph , where nodes represent questions , and links represent a measure of similarity as determined by Quora . The related question graph provides an easy way for users to browse through Quora ’s repository of questions with similarity as a distance metric . In this section , we extract the question graph from our dataset , and seek to determine if the structure of the graph plays a role in helping users to find top questions . Intuitively , a similarity based question graph would produce large clusters of questions around popular topics , with less popular questions relegated to sparse regions of the graph . Thus users following related question links could encounter popular questions with a higher probability . 6.1 Impact of Degree in the Question Graph We build the question graph by crawling and extracting related questions links . By default , Quora lists a fixed number ( 5 ) of related questions on each question ’s main page . These are deemed by Quora to be the most related to the question on the current page .
Since the “ related ” relationship is intuitively a bidirectional property , the question graph is a unweighted , bidirectional graph . Our final question graph has a total of 437K nodes and 1.6M edges . We plot the distribution of question degree in Figure 22 . Although each question only has at most 5 outgoing related questions , most questions have incoming connections from other questions , and thus have a total “ related ” degree greater than 5 . However , there are 9 % questions with degree less than 5 . This is because some of their related questions were not crawled ( questions deleted by Quora ) and thus are not included as nodes . 99 % of the questions have degree less than 50 . The distribution shows a distinctive power law shape , and when we fit the question degree CCDF to the power law , we get an α value of 3.5 with fitting error 0048 Next , we examine the connectivity of the question graph . The question graph is dominated by a single large connected component that covers 98 % ( 430K ) of all questions . On closer inspection , we see that the remaining 2 % of the questions are either newer questions whose related questions have not yet been computed , or they belong to esoteric topics with very few questions and low user interest . Stability . One concern we had about the question graph is whether it is stable , ie does it change on a frequent basis as new questions are added to the system . We test the long term stability of the related question graph by comparing the related question graph across two snapshots . The first snapshot was taken in our primary measurement period of August 2012 . We also took another snapshot in October 2012 ( two months after the first snapshot ) . When we compared the related question set for each question in the system , we found that 60 % of all question had no changes in the time between our snapshots , and 30 % of the questions have only one new entry ( out of five ) in its related question list . Thus we can assume that the related question list is relatively stable over moderate time periods , and our snapshots are a reasonable approximation for earlier versions of the question graph . Question Degree vs . Attention . On each question page , users can browse a series of questions via the related question edges . This leads to the hypothesis that a question with higher question degree can receive more attention , ie more user views , and potentially more answers as a result . We validate this hypothesis as follows . We first group all questions based on question degree in the related question graph . Then we compute the average number of answers and views for questions in each group . We plot the results in Figure 23 . The dashed line represents the average number of user views across all questions with a given node degree , and the solid red line represents the average number of answers received by all questions with a given degree . There are clear trends in both cases . For questions with higher degree ( they are listed as being related to more questions ) , they are accessible to users via a larger number of incoming

The top three tags covers 90 % of the questions in the cluster . links . Hence these high degree questions receive both more page views as well as more answers . The takeaway here is that questions with high degree in the question relation graph correlates strongly to questions that receive more attention and answers from users . 6.2 Locating Similar Questions In the question graph , questions on similar topics are clustered together , while irrelevant questions are likely to be “ related ” to popular questions . Thus they are likely positioned in sparser regions of the graph . In this subsection , we first leverage the graph structure to identify groups of similar questions . We then ask two key questions : do similar questions receive equal attention from users ? If not , what are the potential mechanisms that drive users to certain questions while ignoring other similar questions ? Graph Clustering . We first locate similar questions using the question graph . More specifically , we want to generate question clusters where questions within the cluster are more tightly connected than those outside the cluster . This is a simple definition easily characterized by modularity . We formalize this problem as a graph partition problem , and use the popular graph partitioning tool METIS to perform a multilevel k way partitioning [ 18 ] on our question graph . In this case , we predefine K as the number of clusters we want to generate . We run the graph partitioning algorithm , with K equal to 100 , 1000 , 10,000 and 100,000 . When K is too big , we end up with many small clusters after cutting many edges . On the other hand , when K is too small , we get a small number of big clusters which take in many questions under related topics , but are not truly similar . Since there is no good way to get the ground truth assessment on how “ similar ” the questions are , we randomly sample 10 clusters from each run with different K values , and manually inspect questions within each cluster . We find that the best match between semantic clusters and automatically detected clusters occurs when K =10,000 . So we partition the graph into 10,000 clusters of similar sizes . Table 4 shows an example of one generated cluster . This cluster contains 43 questions , and all questions are related to “ Quora . ” We also extract the topics of the questions in the cluster and rank the topics based on how many questions they are associated with . The top 3 topics of the cluster are listed in the table . We see that the three topics are different but all related . In fact , the top three topics cover 90 % of the questions in this cluster , which indicates a good cluster focused around a single subject . Cluster Analysis . Based on the generated clusters , we can now answer the high level question : do similar questions receive equal attention ? We answer this question by assessing the distribution of user views and answers between questions in the same cluster . We choose to use gini coefficient , a uniformity metric commonly used to evaluate the equality of distributions in economics [ 11 ] . We explain how we compute gini coefficient for each question cluster using Figure 24 . As an example , the x axis has the questions sorted by increasing number of views , and the y axis represents the cumulative portion of the views . So the curve represents y % of contribution ( of views ) by the bottom x % of questions . By definition , the curve is always at or below the dashed line which represents perfect equality of the distribution . Gini coefficient is defined to quantify how close the curve is to the dashed line : G = A A+B , where A and B represent the corresponding areas above and below the curve . As each axis is normalized to 100 % , the gini coefficient G is always within the range of [ 0 , 1 ] , where G=0 means perfect equality or uniformity ( the dashed line in our example ) and G=1 means an extremely skewed distribution . We compute the gini coefficient for the distribution of number of views ( and answers ) of questions in each cluster . As shown in Figure 25 , the solid curve shows the gini coefficient of number of views is highly skewed towards 1 . More than 90 % of clusters have gini coefficient >04 This shows that the numbers of views are extremely uneven among similar questions within each cluster . The same trend applies to answers , as the vast majority of clusters have extremely skewed answer distributions . This means that user attention is tightly focused on a small portion of ( valuable ) questions within each cluster of similar questions . Our results suggest that the structure of the related question graph ( eg question degree ) is at least partially responsible for focusing user attention and answers on a small subset in each cluster of related questions . Next , we ask whether super users play a role in directing traffic towards specific questions in each cluster of related questions . Super User Effect . We evaluate whether the skew in the distribution is caused by super user effect . Intuitively , when a user adds new answers or upvotes existing answers on a question , that question will be pushed to all her followers . Thus super users with more followers can disseminate the question to a larger audience . We use the same definition of super users as in previous analysis by taking the top 5 % of most followed users . We measure the super user effect by comparing the number of views ( answers ) of questions involving super users to other questions with no super user involvement . Among all 10000 clusters , only 1 cluster has no super user in any of its questions , and is not considered in the analysis . Figure 26 shows the scatter plot of average views ( and answers ) of super user involved questions and normal user questions in each cluster . The X axes are presented in ascending order of the views ( answers ) of super user questions , thus the super user question points form a near continuous line . We first compare the average number of user views in Figure 26(a ) . In the vast majority of the clusters , the super user questions have more views than that of questions with no super user involvement . There is only a small number of clusters ( 4 % ) where normal user questions receive more user views then super user questions . Figure 26(b ) compares the two type of questions with respect to average number of answers per question . The result shows that super user involved questions have significantly more answers than normal user questions . Compared to user views , it shows a even stronger impact of super users on drawing answers . In different clusters , super user questions have an average number of answers ranging from 2 to 10 , while questions without super user involvement almost always stays below 2 answers across clusters . Both the number of user views and answers can reflect how much attention each question receives . The result shows choices made by a small number of super users on questions usually affect the focus of attention for the whole community . Summary . We build the related question graph , and find that it is a relatively stable structure even as new questions are constantly

Figure 25 : Gini coefficient of view ( answer ) distribution in each cluster .
Figure 26 : Average # of views ( answers ) of super user questions vs . normal user questions in each cluster . added to the system . We find that high degree questions generally receive more answers and views compared to others . More specifically , the spread of user views and answers within clusters of related questions is extremely skewed towards a small subset of questions . This bias is likely created by the structure of the question graph , and enhanced by super users , as the questions they interact with receive additional views and answers from their followers . 7 . RELATED WORK Community based Q&A . Researchers have studied community based Q&A ( CQA ) sites such as Yahoo Answers [ 13 , 8 , 12 , 25 , 33 , 34 ] , MSN QnA [ 15 , 32 ] , Stack Overflow [ 9 , 22 ] , Math Overflow [ 35 ] from different perspectives . One perspective focuses on managing questions and topics in CQA sites . Some studies look at question archiving and tagging [ 32 ] . Others focus on classifying factual questions with conversional questions [ 12 , 25 ] , or reusing the knowledge collected from old questions to answer new similar questions [ 34 ] . Finally , others evaluate the quality of user generated content , including answer quality [ 33 , 35 , 8 , 16 ] and question quality [ 9 , 20 ] . A second group of work studies user communities in CQA sites . These projects aim to develop algorithms to identify users with high expertise . One direction is to rank users based on expertise measures generated from user history data ( eg questions , answers , votes ) [ 8 , 28 , 21 ] . Another direction is modeling user interaction to design network based ranking algorithms to identify experts [ 17 , 19 , 40 ] . Finally , other works study user community from perspectives such as answering speed [ 22 ] and user incentives in CQA sites [ 15 ] . Our work differs from prior art , since we are the first to analyze a social network based Q&A site using large scale data measurement and analysis . Instead of treating all users as one big community , we explore the impact of a built in social network as well other graph structures on the Q&A activities . A recent report [ 31 ] looks at Quora ’s reputation system in depth with a small dataset of 5K questions . Q&A in Social Networks . Studies have also looked into the question and answering behaviors in existing online social networks . Users can ask their friends questions by posting tweets in Twitter [ 30 ] or updating status in Facebook [ 29 , 27 , 14 ] . These studies answer high level questions like what types of questions are suitable to ask in social networks , and whether strong ties ( close friends ) provide better answers than weak ties . 8 . CONCLUSION Community question and answer sites provide a unique and invaluable service to its users . Yet as these services grow , they face a common challenge of keeping their content relevant , and making it easy for users to “ find the signal in the noise , ” ie find questions and content that are interesting and valuable , while avoiding an increasing volume of less relevant content . In this paper , we use a data driven study to analyze the impact of Quora ’s internal mechanisms that address this challenge . We find that all three of its internal graphs , a user topic follow graph , a userto user social graph , and a related question graph , serve complementary roles in improving effective content discovery on Quora . While it is difficult to prove causal relationships , our data analysis shows strong correlative relationships between Quora ’s internal structures and user behavior . Our data suggests that the user topic follow graph generates user interest in browsing and answering general questions , while the related question graph helps concentrate user attention on the most relevant topics . Finally , the userto user social network attracts views , and leverages social ties to encourage votes and additional high quality answers . As Quora and its repository of data continues to grow in size and mature , our results suggest that these unique features will help Quora users continue find valuable and relevant content . 9 .
