ABSTRACT Link prediction in Microblogs by using unsupervised methods aims to find an appropriate similarity measure between users in the network . However , the measures used by existing work lack a simple way to incorporate the structure of the network and the interactions between users . In this work , we define the retweet similarity to measure the interactions between users in Twitter , and propose a structuralinteraction based matrix factorization model for followinglink prediction . Experiments on the real world Twitter data show our model outperforms state of the art methods .

INTRODUCTION
The link prediction in Microblogs such as Twitter has been extensively studied during recent years . Although link prediction in Microblogs faces the challenge to build a unified framework to balance the social aspect and the information aspect of the Microblogs , the common methodology used in social networks is still instructive , which can be classified into two parts : the supervised methods and the unsupervised methods . Supervised methods treat the link prediction as a classification problem , but they often suffer from the imbalance and feature selection problem . In contrast , the unsupervised methods do not need to know the prior knowledge of the distribution of the data set and can avoid the drawbacks of the supervised methods . The unsupervised methods intend to define a statistics to measure the similarity between two users , such as common neighbors , Jaccard

Very recently , Yin et al . [ 2 ] defined the structure similarity measures between two users with respect to another user , and proposed a structure based matrix factorization model ( S Model ) for link prediction in Microblogs . They discovered that the model achieved higher F1 measure than that obtained by other seven measures such as the Jaccard coefficient and so on . For example , the F1 measure of S model equals 0.197 in dynamic setting with an increase of 0.03 compared with the best method .
Although the S Model gets a higher F1 measure , it does not consider the impact of the interaction between users on link formation . To this end , we propose an unsupervised method , the structural interaction model ( SI Model ) , which integrates the structural information and the interaction information between users to predict future links . This idea comes from the observation that interaction between users correlates with the link formation in Twitter . More precisely , we define the retweet similarity to measure the similarity between two users . Then we establish an objective function consisting of the “ interaction regulation ” term in connection with the retweet similarity . Minimizing the function via the nonnegative matrix factorization leads to a method for link prediction . Experiments based on the real Twitter data show SI Model outperforms state of the art methods by reducing the rmse value by about 70 % on average compared with that obtained by the best method .
2 . THE SI MODEL
In this section , we shall propose a nonnegative matrix factorization based model , called the SI Model to unify the structure of the network and the interactions between users to predict new links of a given user . The problem can be formulated as follows : for a given source user vu , we aim to find a list of target users vi via a list of intermediate user vk , and select the top N target users to recommend to vu . Let Rn×m = ( Rui ) be the rating matrix , where n is the number of source users and m is the number of target users , Rui = 1 if vu follows vi and Rui = 0 otherwise . The matrix factorization method is to factorize the matrix R into two latent matrices An×K and BK×m such that Rui = K k=1 aukbki . We shall define the retweet similarity between two intermediate users vk and vk′ and the objective function F ( A ; B ) which SI Model aims to minimize . Firstly , we define the retweet similarity between two intermediate users vk and vk′ based

) = 1 if nk = nk′ and Ri(k ; k on their interactions with one target user vi respectively in the time interval ( t0 ; t1 ] , denoted by Ri(k ; k ) . The interactions are referred to as the retweet behaviors . Suppose that vi posted a list of s tweets {tw1 ; tw2 ; : : : ; tws} in the ′ time interval ( t0 ; t1 ] . There are two ways to define Ri(k ; k ) . One is to compare the number of retweets of vk and vk′ . Assume that vk retweets nk tweets of vi and vk′ retweets nk′ tweets of vi . Then Ri(k ; k ) can be defined in a binary way : Ri(k ; k ) = 0 otherwise . The other is to define a refined vector to record for vk according to whether vk retweet each of the s tweets of vi as rk = [ rk1 ; rk2 ; : : : ; rks ] , where rki = 0 if vk does not retweet the i th tweet , and rki = 1 otherwise . Similarly , we can get the refined vector for vk′ as rk′ = [ rk′1 ; rk′2 ; : : : ; rk′s ] . Then Ri(k ; k ) can be defined as the cosine similarity of the two ) = ( rk·rk′ )=(∥rk∥·∥rk′∥ ) . n∑ l∑ vectors rk and rk′ , that is , Ri(k ; k With the retweet similarity , we introduce the interaction reg)(auk − ulation term R(A ) as R(A ) = l∑

3 . EXPERIMENT RESULTS
In this section , we describe the prediction result . The data is crawled by Twitter API by randomly selecting 10000 Twitter users , update their immediate neighbors per day from the period of Oct . 1st 2012 and Nov . 19th . This leads to the user networks . Meanwhile , we extracts the tweets of these users per day and use them to construct the retweeting network , where user A have relations with user B if A ’s tweet contains the syntax @B or RT @B , or equivalently , A retweets B or mentioned B in his tweets . In total , there are 140,000 users and 400,000,000 tweets . To conduct our experiment , we randomly select 1000 pairs of snapshots of the data set , and use the first snapshot to predict the following links in the second snapshot . The interval between these two snapshots is chosen as one week . Note that the interval can be chosen differently , for instance , two weeks and so on . Our model runs on the matrix R with 10000 rows and 10000 columns . Two evaluation criterions of the predicting result are used , the Root Mean Square Error ( RMSE ) and the F1 measure based on the breakeven point . To evaluate the performance of the SI Model , we tune the parameters 1 , 2 and 3 in the full grid , where three parameters range from 0 to infinity . After a full search , we find that when 1 = 0:01 , 2 = 0:01 , the optimal RMSE value of the SModel is 0102 Similarly , when 1 = 0:01 and 2 = 0:001 , and set 3 = 0:005 , the optimal RMSE value of the SIModel is 0:033 . The following table lists the comparison of the result by SI model with those by other three methods , the S Model , the Jaccard coefficient ( JC ) and the common neighbors ( CN ) . Note that for the JC and CN methods , there are no RMSE by definition .

Jaccard coefficent Common neighbors
RMSE F1 measure 0.033 0.102
0.278 0.252 0.125 0.091
\ \
From Table 1 we see that SI Model achieves smaller RMSE value and bigger F1 measure than any of the other three model . Especially , the rmse value is reduced by about 0:07 compared with that obtained by S Model . Note that the S Model obtained the RMSE value 0:102 . If we aims to reduce it , the maximal reduction is 0.102 ( corresponding to the value 0 ) . In other words , we get 70 % reduction by using the SI Model . On the other hand , our SI Model get the F1 measure 0.278 , with the increase 0.026 compared to the S Model . Notice that Table 1 lists the average performance . For detailed comparison , we also conduct the experiment . For instance , as for the F1 measure , we illustrate the F1measure of the S Model and the SI Model for 50 different snapshot pairs .
Figure 1 : The F1 measure of S Model and SI Model
From Figure 1 , we see that the SI Model performs better than the S Model for 72 % snapshot pairs in which the second column is higher than the first . Especially , when t = 8 , SIModel get 0.124 increase . For the rest 28 % snapshot pairs , we find SI Model is not better because in these pairs , the retweet behavior between users does not correlate so much with the link formation process . To conclude , the average performance of the SI Model is better than S Model , and it is also competitive in most snapshots . 4 . ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
