ABSTRACT In this paper , we investigate how to identify domain sensitive opinion leaders in online review communities , and present a model to rank domain sensitive opinion leaders . To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model , we conduct preliminary experiments on a from Amazoncom Experimental results indicate that the proposed model is effective in identifying domain sensitive opinion leaders . real world dataset

1 . INTRODUCTION The success and popularity of online review communities , such as Amazon.com have stimulated customers to publish online reviews . Customers share their expertise and opinions , provide suggestions , and form groups in online review communities . The customers whose opinions are representative and authoritative are called opinion leaders in the “ Diffusion of Innovations Theory ” . Usually , opinion leaders reflect the opinions of the masses and have strong influence on other customers . Opinion leader mining has attracted more and more attention and researchers have investigated how to identify opinion leaders from blogosphere , twitters and review communities [ 1][2][3 ] . In the field of opinion leader identification , most existing work is focused on identifying opinion leaders at a global level . Since opinion leaders have different expertise and interest , opinion leaders are domain sensitive . Therefore , it is more suitable to identify opinion leaders in domain level . The key challenge of identifying domain sensitive opinion leaders is how to model opinion ’s authoritativeness and representativeness using customers’ reviews and linking information among customers . In this paper , we propose a ranking model which leverages the link structure of customer networks and their personal expertise and interest . illustrates
2 . THE APPROACH Figure 1 the structure of review communities . Customers publish reviews which belong to different domains . We use domains in which a customer has published reviews as his expertise space . For instance , customer c1 published two reviews

In practice , customers are interested in others’ opinions and form following relationships . Customers who are interested in others’ opinions are called fans , and customers who are interested by others are called friends . For example , customer c2 , c4 and c5 are interested in customer c3 ’s opinion , consequently , c2 , c4 and c5 are fans of c3 and c3 is friend of c2 , c4 and c5 . We represent the following relationships as directed links . The weights of directed links could reflect different closeness among customers . Intuitively , the influence of a customer in a customer network is proportional to the combined importance of his fans . In particular , a customer has high influence if the sum of influence of his fans is high . Although the influence of customers and “ importance ” of web pages shares certain similarities , there are also major differences . Since customers generally have different expertise and interest in various domains , influences of customers also vary in different domains . Consequently , in this paper we identify opinion the link structure and customers’ individual expertise and interest . leaders according to both
Definition 1 : Customers’ expertise matrix
Let C be the set of customers , D be the set of domains and V be the matrix which represents customers’ expertise .
Customers set : C = {c1,c2,c3 ,… , cm} ; Domain set : D = {d1,d2 ,d3,… , dn} ; Customers’ expertise matrix : Vmn ;
Each element vcidj in Vmn represents the number of reviews published by customer i which belong to domain j . We normalize V according to row as V' and according to column as V'' . We utilize customers’ following relationships to construct a directed graph G(U,E ) . In G , U represents all the customers and E refers to their relations . Based on the directed graph G , a random surfer model computes as follows : the random surfer visits each customer with certain probability by following the appropriate edge in G . The random surfer performs a domain sensitive random walk , ie the transition probability from one customer to
Review layerDomain layerCustomer layerc1c3d1c2d4d3d2c4c5r7r6r5r4r3r2r1187 another is domain sensitive . By doing so , we are essentially constructing a domain specific graph among customers .
Definition 2 : Domain specific transition probability Given a domain d , we define the transition matrix Pd , each element in Pd , ie the domain specific transition probability of the random surfer from customer ci to customer cj , is defined as follows :
( 1 )
( 2 ) simd(i , j ) represents the expertise similarity between customer ci and cj in domain d . simd(i , j ) can be calculated by the difference of the two customers’ expertise in domain d . The more similar the two customers’ expertise is , the higher the transition probability from customer ci to cj .
( 3 )
The definition of the domain specific transition considers two aspects . T(i,j ) represents the following relationships among customers and simd(i , j ) captures the customers’ expertise and interest . In certain conditions , some customers might be interested in one another and form a close loop . Since customers in this loop are not interested in other customers outside the loop , high influence will be accumulated without distribution . To tackle this issue , we introduce a teleportation vector Ed like [ 3 ] . Ed is defined as the d th column of matrix V'' .
( 4 )
Based on the domain specific transition probability matrix Pd and teleportation vector Ed , the customer rank in domain d , CRd can be computed iteratively by the following formula . Where α is the weight that can be used to adjust the contribution of Pd and Ed .

To evaluate the approach , we adopt two metrics , coverage and authority as in [ 3][4 ] . To evaluate the effectiveness of the approach , we have compared with two baseline algorithms , PageRank and Indegree based algorithms , as in [ 2 ] and [ 4 ] . Figure 2 shows how the authority and coverage change with the number of identified opinion leaders by different algorithms . From 2 , we can see that our model significantly outperforms the baselines on authority and coverage . This is very important for companies that want to identify opinion leaders with high authority and coverage to accelerate new product diffusion .

In this study , we investigate how to identify domain sensitive opinion leaders and proposed a ranking model . Experiments on real world dataset indicate our approach is effective . As a future research , we plan to exploit textual information to discover customers’ fine grained expertise and interest
