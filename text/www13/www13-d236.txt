ABSTRACT Recent work on unbiased sampling of OSNs has focused on estimation of the network characteristics such as degree distributions and clustering coefficients . In this work we shift the focus to node attributes . We show that existing sampling methods produce biased outputs and need modifications to alleviate the bias .

INTRODUCTION
With the growing size of online social networks ( OSNs ) , efforts to derive a representative sample from OSNs has focused on accurate estimation of the topological features , such as degree distributions [ 3 ] . Not only structural features , but also nodal attributes , such as user profiles , tags , interests , and preferences , are important in market research and public opinion surveys . We expand the focus of sampling methods to the user attribute estimation of OSNs and evaluate the sampling bias of the existing methods .
2 . SAMPLING METHODS
We consider the following seven sampling methods . The ultimate goal of all sampling methods in this work is to estimate ˆxk , the number of nodes with attribute k . Uniform Random Sampling ( RS ) selects a set of nodes S from all nodes in the network uniformly at random . Snowball Sampling ( SN ) is equivalent to breadth first search in our work . Random Walk ( RW ) selects the next node uniformly at random from the neighbors of the current node . The transition probability of moving from x to y is PRW ( x , y ) = degree(x ) ; it is dependent only on the degree of x . It is well known that RW is biased towards high degree nodes . ∗

Metropolis Hastings Random Walk ( MHRW ) modifies the transition probabilities according to a target stationary distribution . Our target stationary distribution f ( x ) is the uniform sampling , where f ( x ) = 1 N and N is the number of nodes in the network . Then the Metropolis Hastings method builds a modified transition probability PM H ( x , y ) as follows :
1
1 − ff degree(x ) min(1 , degree(x ) degree(y ) )
PM H ( x , y ) xfi=y if x .= y , if x = y
⎧⎨ ⎩
PM H ( x , y ) =
|N ( S)|
Unique Sample MHRW ( Uniq MHRW ) : RW based methods can visit a node multiple times , and thus can be construed as sampling with replacements . Uniq MHRW removes multiple occurrences of a node in the random walk sequence and returns only unique nodes . Expansion Sampling ( XSN ) chooses the next node based on the degree to which a node v ∈ N ( S ) contributes to the expansion factor X(S ) , where N ( S ) = neighborbood of S and X(S ) = [ 4 ] . XSN produces subgraphs representative of community structures in the original network . Re Weighted Random Walk ( RWRW ) differs from the six methods above in that it corrects for the bias after the It re weighs ˆxk using the HansenRW sample is chosen . Hurwitz estimator . The estimator of the population total nff t = pi , where yi is the attribute value of node i and pi is its selection probability . We can estimate the proportion of Xk , a set of nodes with attribute k , by yi is ˆt = 1 n

Thinning ( keeping only one every k samples ) is applied to the family of RW based methods to address correlation between consecutive samples .
3 . SAMPLING BIAS OF USER ATTRIBUTES 3.1 Network Topologies and User Attributes We use 3 synthetic networks and 1 real one in our experiment : an Erd˝os R´enyi random graph ( ER ) , a Barab´asiAlbert scale free network ( BA ) , a Watts Strogatz small world network ( WS ) and the Epinion network1(EP ) . All have similar numbers of nodes and edges to those of EP . We make all the networks connected and undirected for the purpose of this work .

Table 1 : Characteristics of the networks used in evaluation and their user attributes . real EP attributes . Uniq MHRW with thinning can be a preferable sampling method as thinning lowers relative error . However , thinning brings about sampling overhead due to slow node coverage speed of MHRW . Uniq MHRW with thinning by 50 hops requires 4.15M walks to sample 50 % of unique nodes for EP network which has only 100k nodes .
We assign user attributes to the nodes with the following three types of schemes . The Scatter scheme selects a node uniformly at random and assigns an attribute to the node . In the BFS scheme , we deploy user attributes tracking a breadth first search from a random seed node . We deploy two attributes having 50 % of the population each in the Scatter and BFS schemes . The Louvain scheme first divides a network into communities with the Louvain community detection method [ 1 ] , and then assigns an attribute per community . That is , in the Louvain scheme , there are as many attributes as the number of communities . In case of EP network we also use 170 , 940 real Epinion user attributes . We summarize the network characteristics and user attributes in Table 1 . Coleman Index ( CI ) indicates the intensity of homophily [ 2 ] . CI = 0 , if attributes are randomly deployed regardless of others . We calculate CI only with the top 50 attributes . xk
3.2 Estimation of User Attributes In our evaluation of the seven sampling methods , we use as a measure of bias , = | xk− ˆxk | , where is the relative error of the estimated ˆxk against xk and ˆxk = sampling rate . In RWRW ˆxk is estimated differently : ˆxk = N × ˆθ(Xk ) . Figures 1 and 2 represent with the sampling rate of 02 We calculate with only 50 attributes as in CI . The more realistic network topology ( power law and clustered ) and user attributes deployment ( homophily ) are , the more erroneoues estimation we obtain .

RS shows the best performance but is not applicable on real OSNs because the whole user id space is not available to the public . SN and RW are highly biased methods in estimating user attributes . RWRW and MHRW show good performance except Louvain attributes . We conjecture that high biases from Louvain attributes are due to the limited extent of samples which only covers particular region of the network . The other limitaion of RWRW and MHRW is existence of duplicate elements in the samples . Only 8.7 % and 44.5 % of elements are unique for MHRW and RWRW respectively in the EP network . In contrast , XSN performs well in the Louvain scheme , but it performs badly for the

Our preliminary results demonstrate the weaknesses of existing sampling methods . We plan to develop a sampling algorithm that produces unbiased estimates of user attributes .
