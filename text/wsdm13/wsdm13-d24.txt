ABSTRACT Many patterns have been discovered to explain and analyze how people make friends . Among them is the triadic closure , supported by the principle of the transitivity of friendship , which means for an individual the friends of her friend are more likely to become her new friends . However , people ’s motivations under this principle haven’t been well studied , and it ’s still unknown that how this principle works in diverse situations .
In this paper , we try to study this principle deeply based on the behavior modeling . We study how one expands her egocentric network via her friends , also called intermediaries , based on the transitivity of friendship . We propose LaFT Tree , a tree based representation of friendship formation inspired from triadic closure . LaFT Tree provides a hierarchical view of the flat structure of one ’s egocentric network by visualizing the expansion trace of one ’s egocentric network . We model people ’s friend making behaviors using LaFT LDA , a generative model for LaFT Tree learning .
The proposed model is evaluated on both synthetic and realworld social networks and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LaFT LDA for LaFT Tree inference . We also present some interesting applications of the LaFT Tree , showing that our model can be generalized and benefit other social network analysis tasks .

INTRODUCTION
Understanding the evolution of social networks is always an appealing and challenging subject for its intricacy . Although most existing research has focused on the structural properties of either a certain snapshot of networks or multiple snapshots of evolving networks , the microscopic growth dynamics have also been studied recently . A number of patterns have been discovered to explain and analyze how people make friends , including preferential attachment [ 19 ] , triadic closure [ 14][23 ] , reciprocity [ 20][9 ] and homophily [ 18][5 ] . Among them , triadic closure has been shown as one of the most frequent processes of link formation [ 14 ] . The sociological principle for triadic closure is the transitivity of friendship [ 22 ] , which says that there is an increased chance that a friendship will form between two people if they already have a friend in common [ 22][8 ] . Though the transitivity of friendship has been proved effective in modeling the network evolution [ 14 ] and predicting future link formations [ 23][7 ] , the deep factors which make this principle work haven’t been well studied yet . A simple question is , is it equally likely for one to close all possible open triadic structures involved of her ?

In this paper , we investigate the friendship transitivity by modeling the friend making behaviors in online social networks . We study triadic closure events from the perspective of an active individual . As mentioned above , people are more likely to create friendships with the friends of their current friends . In this sense , one ’s current friends can be regarded as her potential intermediaries who will introduce new friends to her . However , not all the current v0v10v17v5v1v2v4v3v13v9v15v14v16v12v7v11v8v6v0v10v17v5v1v2v4v3v13v9v15v14v16v12v7v11v8v6 friends have equal influence on one ’s social behaviors . Specifically , for two individuals who have many common friends and become friends later , we would like to distinguish the contributions of each common friend and identify the most important intermediary . The question we’re interested in is , who knows whom via whom ?
To formulate this problem , we propose the Latent Friendship Transitivity Tree ( LaFT Tree ) . LaFT Tree is a tree based representation for the growth process of one ’s egocentric social network . It consists of the person we are interested in ( referred to as the ego ) , and the ego ’s friends . Figure 1(a ) shows an egocentric network with v0 as the ego . The solid lines show the friendships between v0 and each of her friends , while the dashed lines show the friendships among v0 ’s friends . Figure 1(b ) shows the inferred LaFT Tree for v0 using our algorithm introduced later in this paper . In the LaFTTree , the nodes are labeled and arranged vertically according to the time when they became friends of v0 . The root refers to the ego v0 , while other nodes represent v0 ’s friends . The path from the root to each node indicates all the intermediaries who have most likely promoted the friendship between the ego and each node in chronological order .
By visualizing the transitivity of friendship , LaFT Tree provides new perspectives for understanding the evolving social networks . First of all , the LaFT Tree presents a hierarchical view of the flat structure of one ’s egocentric network , by showing the formation process of the network driven by the transitivity of friendship . This enables us to gain insight into the evolving structure of social networks . Furthermore , each node in the LaFT Tree is a possible expansion point of one ’s ego centric networks , via whom one can expand her friend circles by making new friends . From the LaFTTree we can see not only one ’s preference for friends , but also her preference for friend recommenders . In addition , as each branch of the LaFT Tree shows various potential to grow at different times , LaFT Tree can reveal the time dynamics about the expansion trend of one ’s friend circles , and thus can be utilized to predict the future shape of the network .
Taking Figure 1(b ) as example , we can see that v0 knows v1 , v2 and v5 directly , and then by v1 she connects to v6 , via whom she knows more friends including v7 , v8 and v10 later . It can be inferred that v0 prefers to make friends with the friends of v6 . In other words , v6 seems an important expansion point of v0 ’s friend circles . Based on this observation , we can guess that more friends of v6 will become friends of v0 in the future than that of others . However , as the time progresses , we see recently v0 makes more new friends via v14 . Thus , the network may tend to expand along with the direction of v14 in the future .
Nevertheless , the intermediaries are usually not observable in most online social networks . Thus the challenge is how to infer the LaFT Trees , in other words , the intermediaries for each friendships , based on the expansion history of the social network . In this paper , we propose to solve this problem by behavior modeling . We design the LaFT LDA , a generative model to capture the effects of hidden choices of friends through which other friendships are formed . LaFT LDA models the friend making behaviors in a generative manner , in which firstly an ego selects an intermediary , and one of the current friends of the intermediary is then selected as the ego ’s new friend . LaFT LDA can be inferred from data with timestamped links and be utilized for learning the structure of LaFT Trees effectively .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first time the transitivity of friendship is deeply investigated and expressed using LaFTTrees . The contributions of this paper are concluded as follows :
• We propose the LaFT Tree , a latent structure to formulate the transitivity of friendship and capture the evolution process of one ’s egocentric network using a hierarchical representation . • We develop LaFT LDA , a probabilistic generative model for learning the LaFT Trees from social networks , given the timestamped relationship creation and interaction histories .
• We conduct experiments on both synthetic and real world datasets for evaluation and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model for the LaFT Trees learning .
• We apply LaFT LDA and LaFT Tree in real applications , showing the capability of the LaFT Tree for modeling the network growth and analyzing the network properties .
The rest of this paper is organized as follows . We introduce the concepts of LaFT Tree and formulate our problem in Section 2 . Methods of learning the LaFT Trees are developed in Section 3 . In Section 4 we conduct experimental study on both synthetic and real world datasets to evaluate our model . Then we present some interesting applications of our model in Section 5 . We discuss related work in Section 6 and conclude this study in Section 7 .
2 . PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section , we introduce the concepts related to LaFT Tree and formulate the LaFT Tree inference problem . Let G = [ Gt1 , Gt2 ,··· , Gtn ] denote an evolving social network where Gti = ( Vti , Eti ) is a directed graph denoting the snapshot of the network at time ti . Each node in Vti represents an individual in the network , and the edges in Eti indicate the friendships among them . The nodes V and edges E of G are defined as the union of the counterparts of all the snapshots respectively .
We use Ti to denote the period ( ti−1 , ti ] and ∆GTi to denote the new nodes and edges appearing during period Ti ; thus we have Gti = Gti−1 ∪ ∆GTi . We define the function τ : E → R which maps each friendship to its building time . Furthermore , for each ⊂ Vti × snapshot Gti we have a corresponding interaction set XTi Vti which denotes the interactions among individuals in Ti . The interactions include co authoring a paper in scholar collaboration network , leaving a message on Facebook , etc . It should be noted that although the network G is defined to be directed , the problem discussed in this paper is also applicable to undirected networks as the latter can be transformed to directed networks easily . In this paper , we study how E evolves in social networks , ie the formation of people ’s friendships . Based on the transitivity of friendship , when two individuals become friends , we assume their common friends act as the role of “ intermediaries ” . To distinguish the various influence of each common friend on the formation of the new friendship , we define the friendship propagation probability p(z|⟨u , v⟩ ) which denotes the probability that u gets to know v via z . We use Ft(u ) to denote the set of friends of u at t , and Ft(u , v ) to denote the set of common friends of u and v at t .
Definition 1 . ( LaFT Tuple ) For three nodes u , z and v in V , ( u , z , v ) is named as a LaFT Tuple if the following constraints hold :
1 . ∃⟨u , z⟩,⟨z , v⟩,⟨u , v⟩ ∈ E , and τ ( u , z ) < τ ( u , v ) and τ ( z , v ) <
τ ( u , v ) ;
′ ∈ F ( u;v)(u , v ) , p(z|⟨u , v⟩ ) > p(z
2 . ∀z The LaFT Tuple ( u , z , v ) can also be denoted as u fl z v , which implies the most possible friendship propagation among
′|⟨u , v⟩ ) .

Furthermore , occasionally one may make new friends without intermediaries . In this situation we take the ego u as the pseudo intermediary and denote the LaFT Tuple as ( u , u , v ) .
Concatenating the LaFT Tuples we can get the LaFT Trace . Definition 2 . ( LaFT Trace ) A LaFT Trace R(u zn ) = ( u fl z1 z2 ··· zn ) is a directed path with u as the starting node and zn as the destination . In this path , for any adjacent nodes zi and zi+1 , except the starting node u , ( u , zi , zi+1 ) is a LaFT Tuple . The LaFT Trace R(u zn ) = ( u fl z1 z2 ··· zn ) represents the process through which u gets to know zn : she knows z1 first , and then knows z2 via z1 . She makes new friends along this path continuously , and finally connects to zn introduced by zn−1 . In other words , the LaFT Trace R(u zn ) shows how the transitivity has promoted the friendship between u and zn . It should be noted that the recurrence property holds for LaFTTrace . For any intermediary node zi in the LaFT Trace R(u zn ) , R(u zi ) = ( u fl z1 z2 ··· zi−1 zi ) is also a legal LaFT Trace indicating how u gets to know zi .
Based on the LaFT Trace , we can define the Latent Friendship
Transitivity Tree ( LaFT Tree ) .
Definition 3 . ( LaFT Tree ) For any node u in G , a LaFT Tree T ( u ) is a tree structure defined for node u which satisfies the following constraints :
1 . The set of nodes contained in T ( u ) is equal to {u}∪F ( u ) , and u is the root of T ( u ) ;
2 . For any node v in T ( u ) except u , the only path from u to v in T ( u ) is the LaFT Trace R(u v ) .
Now we can formulate our problem as follows : LaFT Tree Inference Problem . Given an evolving social network G = [ Gt1 , Gt2 ,··· , Gtn ] and the associated interaction sets X = [ Xt1 , Xt2 ,··· , Xtn ] , the LaFT Tree inference problem is to infer the LaFT Trees for every individual in G .
3 . LEARNING THE LAFT TREE
In this section , we first propose a generative model , LaFT LDA , which adopts the idea of LDA ( Latent Dirichlet Allocation ) [ 3 ] to model the friend making behaviors naturally . And then we present the inference framework of LaFT LDA and the learning algorithm for LaFT Tree by applying LaFT LDA in cascade .

Figure 2 : The LDA and LaFT LDA Model
3.1 The LaFT LDA Model
The LaFT Tree is proposed based on the principle of transitivity of friendships , which says that one is likely to create new friendships with the friends of her current friends . This principle inspires us to model one ’s friend making behavior using such process : Each time the ego selects one of her current friends as the intermediary first , and then chooses one of the intermediary ’s friends as her new friend . In this process , the ego ’s preference for intermediaries and the “ recommendation ” of the selected intermediary for new friends are critical for the formation of the new relationship . This is similar with the generative process of documents in LDA [ 3 ] ( as shown in Fig 2(a) ) , an unsupervised machine learning technique to identify latent topic structure from large document collection .
The basic elements for LaFT Tree are the LaFT Tuples . For each LaFT Tuple ( u , z , v ) we regard it as the result of a 2 step process : u selects z as an intermediary and via z she makes friends with v . Formally , we propose the LaFT LDA to infer the LaFT Tuples . LaFT LDA is a probabilistic generative model for the social behaviors in social networks . We note that the social behaviors discussed here include the friend making behaviors and social interaction behaviors . LaFT LDA applies to a period Ti and tries to capture the intermediation effect in the expansion of one ’s egocentric network in this period . The basic assumption for LaFT LDA is that in the given period all the behaviors are independent with each other but follow some specific hidden distributions . In the following we omit the subscript Ti for brevity unless specifically stated .
We model individuals’ social behaviors using the intermediary preference distribution θ and the friendship strength distribution ϕ . The former describes one ’s preference for intermediaries when making new friends , while the latter models the closeness between one and each of her friends . The closeness can be captured in two ways : the frequency of their interactions and one ’s willingness to recommend her friends to others .
Now we describe the generative process for the friendships and interactions in a social network in a specific period as follows . For the details of the notations please refer to Table 1 .

( a ) Sample θu ∼ Dir(αu ) . ( b ) For each of the Nu new friends , y : i . Sample an intermediary z ∼ θu ii . Sample a new friend y ∼ ϕz
The graphical representation of LaFT LDA is shown in Fig 2(b ) . We model each intermediary as the distribution over her friends , ie the individuals that may make recommendations to her , and the set of new friendships of an ego as the distribution over her intermediaries . Unlike traditional LDA [ 3 ] which defines the distributions over the whole space , we use heuristic pruning to improve the inference efficiency . We assume only the current friends of an ego may act as her intermediaries , and an intermediary can only recommend her current friends . Thus we add the constraint that for each individual her intermediary preference distribution and friendship strength distribution are only defined over her current friends . Each individual maintains a unique sampling space for herself . Correspondingly , the prior distributions for θ and ϕ are also restricted to be defined on the pruned space . That ’s why the prior parameters α and β need to be defined for each individual u and are placed within the big box labelled U in the graphical model shown in Fig 2(b ) . 3.2 Model Inference
We apply Gibbs sampling technique to infer the LaFT LDA and further obtain the LaFT Tuples . Gibbs sampling is a special case of Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) methods , which can emulate high dimensional probability distributions by the stationary behavior of a Markov chain .
We express the joint probability of all observed and unobserved data with the hidden distributions integrated out , as follows :
P ( Z , X , Y ; α , β ) = u=1
B(Ωu + αu )
B(αu )
B(Λu + Ψu + βu )
B(βu )
( 1 ) where B(· ) is the multinomial Beta function .
The key of Gibbs sampling is to update the estimation for hidden variables iteratively . In LaFT LDA , the only hidden variable is z . In each iteration of Gibbs sampling , we sample z for each new friendship i according to the conditional probability p(zi|Z−i , X , Y ; α , β ) . Y and X are the new friendship and the interaction data respectively , and Z is estimation for the intermediary for each friendship . Z−i is the current estimation except zi .
The sampling probabilities can be estimated by p(zi|Z−i , X , Y ; α , β ) =

Now we present the inference framework in Algorithm 1 . At the beginning , it initializes the friends set F before period Ti , and the new friendships Y that emerge in Ti . Then it randomly picks intermediary for each new friendship . For each friendship each common friend is a candidate intermediary . In each iteration the intermediary assignments are updated using Eq 2 . The iteration is repeated until convergence or the count of iterations reaches a given threshold , and then the hidden distributions are estimated using Eq 3 4 . This algorithm cannot give the exact intermediaries due to its sampling nature ; however , we can get the approximate intermediaries by selecting the most frequent one from the repetitive samples .
For each period we apply the LaFT LDA to infer all the intermediaries z for each friendship and thus get the LaFT Tuples ; further we concatenate the LaFT Tuples to get the LaFT Traces , which can be united to build the final LaFT Trees . 3.3 Learning LaFT Tree with Cascade LaFT
LDA
By splitting the evolving social network G into discrete snapshots Gt1 , Gt2 ,··· , Gtn and inferring the LaFT LDA model on each snapshot independently , we can get the LaFT Tuples , the elements of the LaFT Trees for each period respectively . However , it ’s inaccurate for modeling the network evolution because in each period LaFT LDA only considers the new behaviors but ignores the knowledge of the previous behavior history .
For learning the complete evolving LaFT Trees , we apply the LaFT LDA in cascade , during which the subsequent models can inherit the knowledge learned from the earlier models .
As the prior parameters of the LaFT LDA bring important priori knowledge to the model , we infer the cascade LaFT LDA by allowing the knowledge in the previous periods be transferred into

We define the prior parameters of the LaFT LDA for period Ti using the linear combination of the accumulated knowledge from previous models encoded by their prior parameters and the new knowledge encoded by the statistics in the last period Ti−1 . Specifically , we define : u;z = λ · α(Ti−1 ) α(Ti ) u;v = λ · βTi−1 β(Ti )
+ Ω(Ti−1 ) u;v + Λ(Ti−1 ) u;z u;z u;v + Ψ(Ti−1 ) u;v
( 5 )
( 6 ) where λ is the cascade damping factor . A higher λ allows the subsequent models to inherit more priori information from the earlier models .
For the new friends , which are also the new candidate intermediaries , of each ego , the prior parameters can be initialized with the default values α0 and β0 . However , we can incorporate the priori knowledge from the learned LaFT Trees in previous models to distinguish the intermediaries with various importance . The LaFTTree shows the multiple growth traces of one ’s circle of friends , and the importance of the paths in the tree are different . A new node locating at an important path is assumed to have a higher value for the prior parameter . Thus we let the new intermediary partially inherent the prior parameters of its parent on the LaFT Tree of the ego ; that means , the prior parameters of the new intermediary is proportional to that of its parent intermediary .
In summary , the cascade LaFT LDA allows knowledge accumulation via prior parameters of the models and the learned LaFTTrees in the model inference on the sequential snapshots . By applying the LaFT LDA in cascade , we can get the up to date evolving LaFT Trees for the evolving social network .
4 . EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
In this section , we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed LaFT LDA for LaFT Tree inference . As the LaFT Tuples are the basic components of LaFT Trees , we focus on the inferred LaFTTuples instead of the complete LaFT Trees . For each friendship ⟨u , v⟩ , we try to infer the most possible intermediary z which forms the LaFT Tuple ( u , z , v ) . 4.1 The Synthetic Data
It ’s difficult to evaluate the soundness of our proposed inference algorithms for the LaFT Tree on real data because the intermediaries are completely unobservable in online social networks . Thus we conduct experiments on synthetic data which simulate the evolution of social networks , during which the effect of the intermediaries is considered . Our goal here is to generate synthetic networks and the corresponding LaFT Trees , and then try to recover the original LaFT Trees based on the evolution history of the network and the interaction history among the nodes .
Our synthetic model assumes that the evolution of the network is driven by the LaFT LDA model , in other words , based on the friendship transitivity principle . We generate the synthetic network G in each periods as follows . The set of nodes VT0 is initialized to contain U0 nodes firstly . In each of the following periods Ti , ∆U new individuals , and a number of new friendship edges and interaction edges are added to GTi respectively . For each user , the count of new friendships and interactions follow the Gaussian distribution with mean as N and V respectively . The new friendships and interactions are sampled according to the similar generative process described in Section 31 Each time when one makes new friends , the algorithm produces a probability deciding whether she makes new friend directly or via an existing friend as the intermediary . For the former situation , a new friend is sampled randomly ; for the latter , she will first choose an intermediary according to the interme diary preference distribution and then choose one of the friends of the intermediary according to the friendship strength distribution . Similarly , the interactions are generated according to the friendship strength distributions . 4.2 The Real world Data
We construct 6 real world datasets from DBLP1 and Arxiv2 . DBLP is a computer science bibliography and Arxiv is an archive for electronic preprints of scientific papers in the fields of mathematics , physics , etc . We construct the dataset dblp from DBLP and 5 datasets from Arxiv including astro ph ( Astrophysics ) , cond mat ( Condensed Matter ) , hep ex ( High Energy Physics Experiment ) , hep th ( High Energy Physics Theory ) and nucl ex ( Nuclear Experiment ) .
It ’s usually intractable to observe the real intermediaries in realworld social networks . Luckily , scholar collaborative network is a kind of common social networks and reveals some features which may benefit our evaluation . Many scientific papers are written by more than two authors ; thus , via this paper we can say one of the authors created friendships with all of others . Taking a paper written by A , B and C as instance , if A and B have never collaborated with each other but both of them have co authored with C before , we can assume C acted as the intermediary via whom A and B knew each other . Thus we can say ( A , C , B ) and ( B , C , A ) are two pseudo ground truth LaFT Tuples . Based on this assumption , we collect these pseudo ground truth LaFT Tuples in real world scholar collaborative networks as ground truth to evaluate the intermediary inference performance of our model . In some sense , this can also be regarded as the co author prediction task . The statistics of the pseudo ground truth LaFT Tuples we collect from each dataset are shown in Table 2 . 4.3 Baselines
We consider the two variants of our LaFT LDA model : Standalone LaFT LDA and Cascade LaFT LDA . The former infers the LaFT LDA model in each period independently while the latter allows knowledge accumulation by inferring LaFT LDA in cascade . We compare them with two baseline methods :

4.4 Results on Synthetic Data
We conduct this experiment on the synthetic data generated by the method described in Section 41 In order to evaluate how the performance varies with the sparsity of the network , we make the network grow with different speed . Due to the assumption that only one intermediary is considered for each friendship , our models

Yu also just infer the top 1 most likely intermediary . Thus , we only report the average precision of the models because the recall gives no other information . The results are shown in Figure 3 .
We can see that both Standalone LaFT LDA and Cascade LaFTLDA outperform other methods on all of the datasets . This benefits from the capability of LaFT LDA for capturing the latent friendship propagation traces . Furthermore , we observe that in the early periods , the Standalone LaFT LDA and Cascade LaFT LDA show similar performance , however , the latter outperforms the former quickly in the following periods . This results demonstrate the effect of knowledge accumulation by prior knowledge .
Besides , all of the models show worse performance when the grow speed becomes faster , ie when in each period more new friendships are established in the network . If one makes many new friends in an interval , it’ll become difficult to distinguish the features of these friends from each other , which leads to the confused distributions . However , our LaFT LDA models show more powerful capability of capturing the hidden distributions no matter how the network grows . 4.5 Results on Real world Data
Figure 4 shows the average precision of intermediary inference on the real world datasets . We can see that the LaFT LDA Models outperform the baselines in most occasions . This confirms that in real world the transitivity of friendship really plays important role in the formation of friendships and the intermediaries really exist as co authors connecting two disconnected people . It ’s also proved that LaFT LDA is effective for inferring the intermediary and predicting the co authors . The Cascade LaFT LDA always performs better than the Standalone LaFT LDA , demonstrating the effect of knowledge accumulation in cascades . Furthermore , we can see the empirical method achieves higher precision than the random method . The empirical method considers the one who has the most common friends with the ego as the intermediary based on the empirical assumption that one is more likely to make new friends via the friend with whom she has more common friends . However , it ignores the sequential relationship among the social behaviors and cannot model the actual contribution of each intermediary on the link formations . On the contrary , by modeling the generative process of each friendship based on the principle of transitivity of friendship , our LaFT LDA models achieve promising performance . 4.6 A Case Study on DBLP
In this section , we take Philip S . Yu as an example to show the effectiveness and informativeness of our proposed LaFT Tree . The LaFT Tree of Philip S . Yu inferred from the dblp dataset is shown in Figure 5 . The root of the tree is Philip S . Yu , marked with red , and each of other nodes is a researcher who has ever co published at least one paper with Philip S . Yu . The blue nodes represent the intermediaries of Philip S . Yu and the green nodes are co authors via whom Philip S . Yu hasn’t made new friendships yet . Other nonintermediary co authors are omitted for brevity .
We can see that Jiawei Han leads the largest subtree , implying that Philip S . Yu is likely to build friendships with the co authors of

Figure 6 : The link prediction performance on 6 real world datasets .
Jiawei Han . Furthermore , two subbranches growing from Ke Wang and Jeffrey Xu Yu of the Jiawei Han ’s branch are also luxuriant , showing the closeness of Philip S . Yu with this community .
The variance of Philip S . Yu ’s preference for friends and intermediaries is also revealed by this tree . Since Philip S . Yu knew Haixun Wang at 2001 , he co authored with many friends of the latter in the following years . However , Vincent S . Tseng , Bing Liu , Ling Liu and Huan Liu become important intermediaries of Philip S . Yu in recent years . Ming Syan Chen should be a close intermediary of Philip S . Yu for that the former keeps recommending new friends to the latter since their friendship was created at 1989 .
5 . APPLICATIONS
In this section , we apply the LaFT Tree and LaFT LDA in other interesting tasks and illustrate the generality of our model . Specifically , based on our model , we propose LaFT Proximity for link prediction , LaFT Patterns for analyzing the expansion traces of social networks and a family of LaFT Centrality measures for evaluating the importance of nodes in social networks . 5.1 LaFT Proximity for Link Prediction
Among the applications is link prediction , a classical task which aims to predict the new links given the current social network . One of the most common approaches is based on the topological proximity , assuming that the similar nodes are likely to become friends in the future [ 17 ] . As LaFT LDA models people ’s social behaviors , we can get a new topological proximity measure , LaFT Proximity for link prediction , with the effect of the intermediaries taken into consideration :
∑ z∈F ( u;v )
LaFT Proximity(u , v ) =
θu;z · ϕz;v .
( 7 )
511 Experimental Study We evaluate LaFT Proximity in the link prediction tasks on the real world datasets introduced in Section 42 Given a snapshot of the evolving network G at time ti , we predict the new links in ti+1 . In this problem , we only predict the new born edges without considering the new born vertices , and for each ego we only consider the 2 hop neighbors as candidate friends since 2 hop connections are dominant in link formations [ 14 ] .
We compare LaFT Proximity with some other popular topological proximity measures , including Common Neighbors , Jaccard Coefficient , Adamic / Adar and Preferential Attachment . For the details of these measures one can refer to [ 17 ] . Due to the goal of this task is to demonstrate the potential of LaFT model for link prediction , we just use the basic popular measures and don’t devote to highly complicated , maybe more powerful , algorithms . We use popular AUC ( Area Under the ROC Curve ) to evaluate the performance of the aforementioned measures .
Figure 6 displays the AUC value of the link prediction results on each dataset and in each year . We can see that LaFT Proximity achieves the best performance on almost all of the datasets . Preferential Attachment is always the worst and Common Neighbours comes next . Both Jaccard Coefficient and Adamic/Adar measure the proximity of two nodes by distinguishing the importance of their common friends based on the structural features . Unlike them , LaFT Proximity is based on the transitivity of friendship , a fundamental sociological principle for explaining link formation , and regard the common friends as potential intermediaries with various influence on the expansion of one ’s friend circles . By modeling the friend making behaviors with one ’s preference for intermediaries and new friends taken into consideration , LaFT Proximity performs better than other measures .

5.2 LaFT Patterns
The LaFT Traces show one ’s friend making sequences and such behavior sequences may contain valuable information about how people usually expand their friend circles . We’re interested in whether there exist some sequence patterns for one to make new friends . We define the frequent subsequences of the LaFT Traces as LaFT Patterns , denoted by ( s1 , s2,··· , sn ) . The pattern means that someone who is a friend of s1 will likely be a friend of s2 later , and then a friend of sn in the future .
We apply PrefixSpan algorithm [ 21 ] on our LaFT Traces collection learned from the dblp dataset . In the area of data mining , the length 5 patterns with highest support include ( Alon Y . Levy , Jayant Madhavan , Philip A . Bernstein , Raghu Ramakrishnan , Jeffrey F . Naughton ) , ( Beng Chin Ooi , Hongjun Lu , Aoying Zhou , Wen Jin , Jian Pei ) and ( Daniel P . Lopresti , Richard J . Lipton , Avrim Blum , Prabhakar Raghavan , Jon M . Kleinberg ) . Among the length 4 patterns are ( Shih Fu Chang , John R . Smith , Chung Sheng Li , Philip S . Yu ) , ( Daniel P . Lopresti , Richard J . Lipton , Avrim Blum , Prabhakar Raghavan ) , ( Baile Shi , Zengping Tian , Hongjun Lu , Beng Chin Ooi ) , ( Beng Chin Ooi , Jiawei Han , Philip S . Yu , Jian Pei ) . Jian Pei , Jon M . Kleinberg , Philip S . Yu and Jiawei Han appear in most of the identified patterns , implying that they are among the most active researchers .
LaFT Patterns show important axes of the whole structure of the network and indicate how people expand their networks in every circle . Given the LaFT Pattern ( Beng Chin Ooi , Jiawei Han , Philip S . Yu , Jian Pei ) , we can infer that someone who is a friend of Beng Chin Ooi is likely to become a friend of Jiawei Han and then connects to Philip S . Yu and Jian Pei later . This pattern also reveals that many people associate with Philip S . Yu via some paths including Jiawei Han and make friends with Jian Pei benefiting from the recommendations of Jiawei Han and Philip S . Yu .
5.3 LaFT Centrality Family
People ’s intermediary preference and friendship strength provide new perspectives for calculating the importance of nodes wrt their influence on the network evolution . We incorporate the two distributions , θ and ϕ , into the popular PageRank and HITS algorithms as the personalized weights , yielding a family of centrality measures . Specifically , LaFT Intermediation Centrality uses the intermediary preference as personalized weights in PageRank and thus produces the most important intermediaries , while LaFTRecommendation Centrality takes the friendship strength in PageRank and ranks the individuals based on the extent to which others would like to recommend them to their friends . Adapting with HITS , LaFT Hub Centrality ranks the individuals high if via them others may get to know new friends of high quality , and LaFTAuthority Centrality ranks them high if many important individuals will recommend them to their friends . All the four measures ana lyze the importance of the individuals in the network from the role of them in promoting the network evolution .
The top 10 researchers in the domain of data mining ranked by various measures are shown in Table 3 . We can conclude that Jiawei Han and Christos Faloutsos are the most important intermediaries , and Hector Garcia Molina and Christos Faloutsos are most likely to be introduced to others . From another perspective , via Philip S . Yu and Huan Liu people can know most authoritative researchers , while most influential researchers will recommend Jiawei Han and Huan Liu , etc .
6 . RELATED WORK
The evolution of social networks has attracted considerable attention recently from both the macroscopic and microscopic perspectives . In macroscopic view , researchers focused on the varying global properties of the networks [ 12][15 ] . Many evolution models have been proposed to model the evolving social networks , including Preferential Attachment [ 1 ] , Copying Model [ 13 ] and Forest Fire Model [ 15 ] , etc . In microscopic view , researchers studied the formation and variation of the links in the network . It has been formulated as the link prediction task since the seminal work of Liben Nowell and Kleinberg [ 17 ] . Furthermore , people are also interested in the patterns which describe how the network evolves [ 14 ] and how people make friends [ 10 ] . They’ve found many interesting patterns , such as preferential attachment [ 19 ] , triadic closure [ 14][23 ] , reciprocity [ 20][9 ] and homophily [ 18][5 ] . Besides , researchers also studied the general evolution patterns with arbitrary structures [ 16][2 ] .
Triadic closure has been noticed by sociologists long ago . Simmel provided several theoretical rationales for proffering the triad as the basic social unit and theorized that people with common friends are more likely to create friendships [ 24 ] . This theory then was applied by Krackhardt and Handcock to explain the evolution of triangle closures [ 11 ] . Triadic closure has also been explained using the transitivity of friendship [ 22 ] . Recently , the role of triadic closure was further investigated and it was found that most of the links are likely to close triangles , ie , connect people with common friends [ 14 ] . Golder and Yardi found that transitivity and reciprocity ties can increase the likelihood of forming relationships in Twitter [ 7 ] . Romero and Kleinberg developed a formalization and methodology for studying the directed triadic closure process , and provided evidence for its important role in the formation of links on Twitter [ 23 ] . Triadic closure has also been utilized for friend recommendation [ 4 ] and network evolution prediction [ 6 ] . However , it hasn’t been studied that how the triadic closure works in various situations . In this paper , we conduct in depth research on triadic closure based on behavior modeling .
Simmel analyzed the roles of the participants in the triadic structure and pointed out the possible role of the third person in inter actions as mediation and brokerage , referred to as intermediaries in this paper . Nevertheless , it ’s still unknown how the third person will affect or promote the new link . Yin et al . studied the link prediction problem taking the intermediary into consideration and regarded the link formation as the result of the pseudo recommendation of the intermediate node [ 25 ] . They decomposed the adjacency matrix of the current social network into two matrixes , one of which presents the intermediary preference probability and the other presents the recommendation acceptance probability . Unlike their work which analyzes the pseudo intermediary effect in a static snapshot of the network , we try to find the real intermediaries and study how the intermediaries contribute to the link formations . 7 . CONCLUSION
Can we go further in explaining the link formation in social networks ? Inspired by the famous sociological principle , ie the transitivity of friendship , and several classical work which proved the importance of intermediaries in creating new friendships , we study the link formation using behavior modeling . Specifically , we study the triadic closure , one of the most frequent patterns in the network evolution . In this paper , while most new links form triangles , we further argue that some nodes are particularly favored when this happens .
In such a world , we propose the LaFT Tree , a tree based representation of friendship formation which captures the growing process of one ’s egocentric network driven by the triadic closure . Furthermore , we propose a generative model , LaFT LDA , to model the social behaviors in social networks . LaFT LDA can be inferred from data with timestamped links and utilized to solve the question of “ who are the most likely intermediaries that connect the ego and others ” , and further build the LaFT Trees . The model is evaluated on synthetic data and DBLP/Arxiv collaboration networks . In addition , we also present interesting applications of the LaFT Tree and LaFT LDA for social network analysis , illustrating the generality of our model on other problems and the capability for understanding the evolving structure of social networks . 8 .
