ABSTRACT The tutorial will summarize the state of the art in the growing area of computational political science . Like many others , this research domain is being revolutionized by the availability of open , big data and the increasing reach and importance of social media . The surging interest on the part of the academic community is matched by intense efforts on the part of political campaigns to use online data in order to learn how to best disseminate information and reach the right potential donors or voters . In this context , a tutorial can summarize existing methods in a fascinating , high interest area and allow participants with diverse backgrounds to get inspiration from the methods and problems studied . The tutorial will feature seminal research concerning ( i ) political polarization , ( ii ) election prediction and polling , and ( iii ) political campaigning and influence propagation . The goal is not only to familiarize attendees with ideas from related conferences such as WWW , ICWSM or CIKM , but also to present ideas and quantitative methods closer to political science such as Poole ’s and Rosenthal ’s NOMINATE score for a politician ’s political orientation .

1 . TARGET AUDIENCE AND OBJECTIVE This half day tutorial targets researchers from the growing area of computational social science as well as , more generally , researchers with interests in web and data mining or its applications to political science . Attendees will be familiarized with the problems studied , the methods applied and the datasets used in a range of research work in computational political science both before but mostly after the start of the Web era . After the tutorial , participants will have an in depth knowledge of the current state of the art concerning ( i ) quantifying political polarization , ( ii ) election predictions and ( iii ) quantitative analysis of political campaigning .

2 . OUTLINE The tutorial will cover seminal and important academic papers and techniques in the area of Data Driven Political Science [ 1 ] . It will be organized in three topically coherent parts with a focus on ( i ) political polarization , ( ii ) election predictions and polling , and ( iii ) political campaigning and influence propagation . Each part will roughly last 1 hour . 2.1 Political polarization : We will discuss studies and measures of political polarization where the object of polarization can be a politician , a social media user , a web site , a web search query , or text such as a political speech . Focus will be given to ( i ) how to define and validate political polarization and political orientation , ( ii ) how to compute it algorithmically , and ( iii ) the datasets being used in studies . The methods presented will include some well known in political science , but not traditionally used in computer science , such as the NOMINATE score and its variants . While we will focus on the US political system due to its simple left/right structure , we will discuss ways to generalize existing methods to multidimensional political systems [ 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 ] . 2.2 Election predictions and polling : Recently , many new approaches to using social media for election predictions have been presented . Some studies claim good results even using mere per party tweet counting but others have cast serious doubts on those results and the methodology . We will give a survey of these different approaches and their results . We will also feature prediction market based approaches and other novel methods polling [ 14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21 ] . 2.3 Political campaigning and influence propagation Social media and the Web in general can be used to observe political activity but also to shape politics , in particular through political campaigning and attempts to start grassroot movements among enthusiastic political followers . We will describe studies covering either centralized political campaigning or the effects of “ viral ” propagation on political opinions . The focus here will be on methods the effects of such campaigns [ 22,23,24,25,26,27,28 ] . 3 . ORGANIZERS’ BIOS Ingmar Weber is a senior scientist at the Qatar Computing Research Institute . His research covers a wide subject area from classical to interdisciplinary studies in web science . While at Yahoo! Research Barcelona , he led the development of the Political Search Trends and Political Hashtag Trends demos which assign to search queries and Twitter hashtags political respectively . In August 2012 he the course “ An that quantify forecasting information retrieval , leanings to sponsored search , to political taught and
777 Introduction to Web Science ” at the RuSSIR summer school , featuring elements from computational political science . Together with Ana Maria and Marco he organized the PLEAD ( Politics , Elections and Data ) workshop at CIKM 2012 . Ana Maria Popescu is a research scientist working with early stage social startups . Previously , she was a text mining scientist at Yahoo! Labs where she most recently worked on social media mining and user modeling . While at Yahoo! , she co led the Twitter analytics effort for the Yahoo! News Election 2012 coverage . Ana obtained her PhD in 2007 from University of Washington with a thesis in information extraction from the Web . Marco Pennacchiotti is an applied scientist and principal engineer at eBay , where he leads the science on social media . Before joining eBay in June 2012 , he was a research scientist at Yahoo! Labs , focusing on text mining , information extraction applied to big data and social media . At Yahoo! , he wrote papers focusing on user profiling also applied to the political domain . Marco obtained a PhD in natural language processing and information extraction in 2007 from the University of Rome , Italy . 4 .
