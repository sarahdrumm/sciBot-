ABSTRACT User recommender systems are a key component in any online social networking platform : they help the users growing their network faster , thus driving engagement and loyalty .
In this paper we study link prediction with explanations for user recommendation in social networks . For this problem we propose WTFW ( “ Who to Follow and Why ” ) , a stochastic topic model for link prediction over directed and nodes attributed graphs . Our model not only predicts links , but for each predicted link it decides whether it is a “ topical ” or a “ social ” link , and depending on this decision it produces a di↵erent type of explanation .
A topical link is recommended between a user interested in a topic and a user authoritative in that topic : the explanation in this case is a set of binary features describing the topic responsible of the link creation . A social link is recommended between users which share a large social neighborhood : in this case the explanation is the set of neighbors which are more likely to be responsible for the link creation . Our experimental assessment on real world data confirms the accuracy of WTFW in the link prediction and the quality of the associated explanations .

INTRODUCTION
Link prediction is the task of estimating the likelihood of the existence of an unobserved link between two nodes , based on the other observable links around the two nodes and , when available , the attributes of the nodes [ 8 ] . It finds application in any context in which the network is only partially observable and we want to guess the unobserved part . A typical setting is when we consider the network evolving along time , so that the unobservable part of the network is the set of links which are not yet created : given the graph observed at time t , we want to predict the set of links which will be created in the time interval [ t , t + 1][17 ] .
Link prediction has been applied in a variety of domains , ranging from bioinformatics to web sites management , from bibliography to e commerce [ 12 , 18 , 5 ] . However , the most immediate and prominent application of link prediction is the recommendation of users to other users of a social network . This is one of the most fundamental functionalities common to all on line social networking platforms1 : it helps the users having a quicker start in building their network , thus driving engagement and loyalty . It is a key component for growth and sustenance of a social network : for instance , the Wtf ( “ Who to Follow ” ) service at Twitter is claimed to be responsible for millions of new links daily [ 11 ] . Given that growing the user base and maintaining a high level of engagement are key factors for the success ( or the death ) of these billion dollar businesses , one can easily figure out the importance of user recommendation systems .
In this paper we study link prediction with explanations for user recommendation systems in on line social networks . Enriching recommendations with explanations has the benefit to increase the trust of the user in the recommendation , and thus the likelihood that the recommendation is adopted . While these benefits are well understood in classic collaborative filtering recommender systems [ 14 , 25 , 30 ] , providing explanations in the context of user recommendation systems is still largely underdeveloped : in fact , in most of the real world systems , the unique explanations given for user recommendations are of the type “ you should follow user Z because your contacts X and Y do the same ” .
Our starting observation is that a link creation is usually explainable by one of two main reasons : interest identity or personal social relations . This observation is rooted in sociology , where it goes under the name common identity and common bond theory [ 24 , 26 ] . Identity based attachment holds when people join a community based on their interest in a well defined common theme shared by all of the members of that community . The goal in this case is information collecting and sharing in the specific theme of interest . People joining a community through identity based links may not even directly participate , eg , by producing content or by engaging with other members , and instead only passively consume information .
Conversely , bond based attachment is driven by personal social relations with other specific individuals ( eg , family , friends , colleagues ) , and thus it does not require a common theme of interest to be justified . Bond based links are usu
1Eg , “ People You May Know ” in Facebook and LinkedIn , “ Recommended Blogs ” in Tumblr , or “ Who to Follow ” in Twitter , just to mention a few . ally reciprocated , while identity based links are much more directional , where the direction is given by the level of authoritativeness of the user on the theme . The two types of links create two di↵erent types of communities , that for simplicity we name “ topical ” for identity based and “ social ” for bond based [ 10 ] .
Based on this observation we define a stochastic model , dubbed WTFW ( “ Who to Follow and Why ” ) , which not only predicts links , but for each predicted link it decides whether it is a topical or a social link , and depending on this decision it produces a di↵erent type of explanation .
A topical link u ! v ( u should follow v ) is usually recommended to u when v is authoritative in a topic in which u has demonstrated interest . In this case the explanation is a set of the top k binary features ( eg , tags in Flickr or hashtags in Twitter ) describing the topic of authoritativeness of v , which makes v a potential source of interesting information for u . A social link u ! v instead is recommended when u and v are already part of the same social community , ie , they have many contacts in common . In this case the explanation is the set of the top k common neighbors wrt the likelihood of being responsible for the link creation . As an important by product , WTFW also implicitly detects communities and their type ( social or topical ) .
More in details WTFW is a bayesian topic model defined over directed and nodes attributed graphs . In WTFW each link creation and each attribute adoption by a node are explained wrt a finite number of latent factors . These latent factors can be abstractly thought as topics or communities : in the rest of the paper we will use the three terms ( latent factor , topic , and community ) interchangeably . Each community is characterized by a level of sociality/topicality : social communities are characterized by high density and reciprocity of links , whereas topical communities are characterized by low entropy in the features and by the presence of authoritative users on the relevant topic . Each user tend to be involved in di↵erent communities to di↵erent extent and with di↵erent roles . These components are modeled by three di↵erent multinomial distributions over the set of users , modeling their sociality , authoritativeness and interest in each topic . Finally , each topic is characterized by a multinomial distribution over the feature set , which provide a semantic interpretation of the topic . Paper contributions . The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :
• We study for the first time the problem of link prediction with explanations , which is motivated by the real world application of user recommender systems in online social networks .
• We introduce WTFW ( “ Who to Follow and Why ” ) a stochastic topic model which not only predicts links , but for each predicted link it decides whether it is a topical or a social link , and depending on this decision it produces a di↵erent type of explanation .
• As a by product , WTFW also implicitly extract communities that can be labeled as either topical or social . • Our experimental assessment on two real world datasets ( Twitter and Flickr ) confirms that our model is very accurate in link prediction and in labeling the predicted link as social or topical . The experiments also highlight the high quality of the topics extracted and their coherence with the topical Vs . social labeling .
2 . RELATED WORK
Link prediction has attracted a great deal of attention in the last decade ( the interested reader may refer to [ 12 , 18 ] for a comprehensive survey ) : however , to the best of our knowledge , no previous work has studied link prediction with explanations for user recommendation systems . Our proposal can also be collocated in the literature on relational learning methods that are able to leverage attribute information on nodes [ 29 , 34 , 19 ] . The main drawback of those approaches is scalability , which seriously prevents their application on real world networks .
The Supervised Random Walk algorithm for link prediction [ 1 ] , exploits edge features to learn the edge strength that is then used random walk transition probability . Alternative random walk approaches rely on merging the social graph and node attributes in a unique graph with personnodes and attribute nodes linked among them [ 33 , 9 ] .
The joint factorization of social links and node attributes is closely related to the task of detecting communities in nodes attributed graphs . [ 35 ] uses node attributes to augment the social graph by generating “ attribute edges ” between nodes that are similar on a given attribute , and then identify communities in the augmented graph . [ 21 ] introduces the problem of finding cohesive patterns , defined as connected subgraphs whose density exceeds a given threshold , and with homogeneous values on node attributes . [ 31 ] proposes a co clustering framework based on users and tags . Users are implicitly connected by their common interests , as expressed by the tags they use . [ 23 ] studies the problem of finding communities with concise descriptions based on the nodes attributes .
Several stochastic models for community detection in networks with node attributes have been proposed in the literature . In Link LDA [ 6 ] social connections and user attributes are generated by a mixture of user specific distributions over topics . In [ 22 , 15 , 32 ] the community membership vectors are used to factorize both links and the attribute profile of each user . [ 27 ] extends the author topic model to communication networks in which the sender and recipient of each post are known . [ 2 ] proposes a generative stochastic model to detect communities from the social graph and a database of information propagations over the social graph .
3 . WHO TO FOLLOW AND WHY
In this section we introduce the WTFW model for link prediction with explanations . Our application scenario is that of online social networking platforms , where users build and maintain social connections , share information , and follow updates from other users . We represent this as a directed graph , where each node is a user and it has associated a set of binary features , representing the interests of the user .
More formally , let G = ( V , E ) be the social graph where V is a set of n users , E ✓ V ⇥ V is a set of m directed arcs , and ( u , v ) indicates that u follows v and hence he is notified of v ’s activities . We also denote the neighborhood of a node u as N ( u ) = {v 2 V : ( u , v ) 2 E _ ( v , u ) 2 E} . Moreover let F denote a set of h binary features . We are given a binary n⇥ h matrix F such that Fu,f = 1 when user u is interested in the feature f . For simplicity we denote this case also as ( u , f ) 2 F . Finally , we denote all the features of the node u as F ( u ) = {f 2 F : ( u , f ) 2 F} and the set of all the nodes having attribute f as V ( f ) = {u 2 V : ( u , f ) 2 F} .

Figure 1 : Generative process for the WTFW model
Following the common identity and common bond theory discussed in Section 1 , we assume two main types of behavior in creating connections in a social network . The “ topical ” behavior , in which a user u decides to follow another user v because of u ’s interest in a topic in which v is authoritative ; and the “ social ” behavior in which u follows v because they know each other in the real world , or they have many common contacts in the social network . In the topical behavior case we can further identify two distinct roles for a user , either as authoritative ( “ influential ” ) for the topic or just interested ( “ susceptible ” ) in the topic . In the social case instead there are no specific roles , but a generic tendency to connect among the users of a close knit circle .
Following these considerations , we propose to explain the structure of the network ( the links ) and the features of the nodes , by introducing a set of latent factors representing users’ interests , and by labeling the links as either social or topical . This is done by means of a unique stochastic topic model , which is based on the following assumptions : lapping communities ) ;
• Links can be explained by di↵erent latent factors ( over• Social links tend to be reciprocal and communities characterized by a high level of sociality exhibit high density ; • Topical links tend to exhibit a clear directionality and communities that are highly topicality have low entropy on the set of features assigned to nodes .
More in details , the degree of involvement and role of user u in the community/topic k is governed by three parameters : ( 1)Ak,u which measures the degree of the authoritativeness of u in k ; ( 2)Sk,u which measures the degree of interest u in the topic k , or in other terms , the likelihood of following users that are authoritative in k ( susceptibility to social influence ) ; and ( 3)✓k,u denotes the social tendency of u , ie , her likelihood to connect to other social peers within community k . Moreover , each latent factor k is characterized by

Figure 2 : The WTFW model in plate notation . a propensity to adopt certain features in F over others . We can formalize such a propensity by means of a weight  k,f , denoting the importance of feature f within k .
All these components are accommodated in a mixture membership model expressed in a Bayesian setting [ 4 ] , to define distributions governing the stochastic process , given some prior hypotheses . Bayesian modeling is better suited when the underlying data is characterized by high sparsity ( like in our case ) , as it allows a better control of the priors which govern the model and it prevents overfitting .
In particular , we directly model each observed social link ( u , v ) 2 E or adoption of feature by a node ( u , f ) 2 F and introduce random variables on the source/destination of these observations . That is , for each link ( u , v ) 2 E we model the likelihood that there exists a latent factor k , such that u has high probability of being a source , while v has high probability of being a destination . We further introduce a latent variable xu,v , which encodes the ( social/topical ) nature of an existing link . Analogously , the adoption of an observed feature association ( u , f ) 2 F will be explained by a latent factor k and by the status of the latent variable yu,f which represent the role of the user u , either as authoritative or just interested , when adopting the feature f .
The underlying generative process for social links and adoption of features depends jointly on the components ✓ , A , S and   , as described in Figure 1 and depicted in plate notation in Figure 2 . The overall generative process is governed by the following components :
• A multinomial distribution ⇧ over a fixed number of K latent factors , which generate latent communityassignments zl and za , for each link l 2 E and for each adoption of feature a 2 F ; • The multinomial distributions ✓k , Ak and Sk over the set of user V , which specify , respectively , the degree of sociality , authority and susceptibility of each user within k ;
• The multinomial probability  k over F which specify the likelihood of observing each feature within the community k .
• The degree of “ sociality ”  k ( or “ topicality ” , 1 k ) which measures the likelihood of observing social/topical connections within each community k ;
• The “ authoritative attitude ” ⌧k of observing the adoption of an attribute by authoritative subject in k ( or , dually , the “ susceptible attitude ” , 1   ⌧k ) .
Since the whole model relies on multinomial and Bernoulli distributions , a full Bayesian treatment can be obtained by adopting Dirichlet and Beta conjugate priors .
Let ⇥ = {⇧ ,   , ⌧ , ✓ , A , S} denote the status of the distributions described above . Both the probability of observing link l = ( u , v ) and a feature assignment a = ( u , f ) can be expressed as mixtures over the latent community assignments zl and za :
Pr(l|⇥ ) =
Pr(a|⇥ ) =
⇡k Pr(l|zl = k , ⇥ )
⇡k Pr(a|za = k , ⇥ )
( 1 )
( 2 )
KXk=1 KXk=1
The generation of a link changes depending on the status of the latent variable xl . A social connection l = ( u , v ) can only be observed if , by picking a latent community k , u and v have high degrees of social attitude ✓k,u and ✓k,v , that is
Pr(l|zl = k , xl = 1 , ⇥ ) = ✓k,u · ✓k,v .
Conversely , a topical connection l = ( u , v ) can only be observed if , by picking a latent community k , u has a high degree of activeness Ak,u and v have a high degree of passive interest Sk,u , that is
Pr(l|zl = k , xl = 0 , ⇥ ) = Sk,u · Ak,v .
Note that the likelihood of observing the reciprocal link ( v , u ) is equally likely in case of social connection , while it is di↵erent in a topical context , and hence reflect our design assumption on the directionality of links in social/topical communities . Each link is finally generated by taking into account the social/topical mixture of each community :
Pr(l|zl = k , ⇥ ) = k Pr(l|zl = k , xl = 1 , ⇥ )
+ ( 1    k ) Pr(l|zl = k , xl = 0 , ⇥ )
= k · ✓k,u · ✓k,v + ( 1    k ) · Sk,u · Ak,v
Similarly , the probability of observing a node feature pair a = ( u , f ) 2 F depends on the degree of authoritativeness/susceptibility of the user and by the likelihood of observing the attribute f within each latent factor k :
Pr(a|za = k , ⇥ ) = ( ⌧kAk,u + ( 1   ⌧k ) · Sk,u )  k,f .
Here , the term ⌧kAk+(1 ⌧k)Sk defines a multinomial distribution over users , which encodes the joint ( both susceptible and authoritative ) attitude of users within that community . 3.1 Learning
We have described the intuitions behind our joint modeling of links and feature associations and now we focus on defining a procedure for inference and parameter estimation under WTFW . Let ⌅ = {~⇠ , ~↵ , ~  , ~  , ~⌘ , ~  = { 0 ,  1} , ~⌧ = {⌧0 , ⌧1}} denote the set of hyperparameters of the Dirichlet/Beta priors . Also , let Ze represents a binary m⇥K matrix where zl,k = 1 denotes that link l has been associated with the k th latent factor ( ie , zl = k ) . Analogously , Zf denotes the t ⇥ K binary matrix where za,k = 1 denotes that feature assignment a 2 F is associated with the k th latent factor ( za = k ) . Finally , X and Y denote the vectors of assignments xl and ya .
With an abuse of notation , we also introduce the counters described in Tab . 1 , relative to these matrices .
The key problem in inference is to compute the posterior distribution of latent variables given the observed data . We start by expressing the joint likelihood as :
Pr(E , F , ⇥ , Ze,Zf , X , Y|⌅ ) =
Pr(E|⇥ , X , Ze ) Pr(F|⇥ , Y , Zf ) Pr(Ze|⇧ ) Pr(Zf|⇧ ) Pr(X|Ze ,   ) Pr(Y|Zf , ⌧ ) Pr(⇥|⌅ )

 cs k ( 1    k)ct ⌧ da k ( 1   ⌧k)ds k k and Pr(⇥|⌅ ) represents the product of all the Dirichlet and Beta priors . By marginalizing over ⇥ , we can obtain a closed form for the joint likelihood Pr(E , F , Ze , Zf , X , Y|⌅ ) . The latter is the basis for developing a stochastic EM strategy [ 3 , section 1116 ] , where the E step consists of a collapsed Gibbs sampling procedure [ 13 , 3 ] for estimating the matrices Ze , Zf , X and Y , and the M step estimates both the predictive distributions in ⇥ and the hyperparameters of interest in ⌅ . In particular , the sampling step consists of a sequential update of each arc and featureassignment , of the status of the corresponding latent variables in Ze , Zf , X and Y . A possible sampling strategy for each arc l 2 E and adoption a 2 F is based on the following chain : Pr(zl = k|Rest ) , Pr(za = k|Rest ) , Pr(xl = 1|Rest ) and Pr(ya = 1|Rest)2 . By algebraic manipulations , we can devise the sampling equations expressed in Tab . 8 . The overall learning scheme is shown in Alg . 1 . Lines 5 12 of the algorithm represent the Gibbs sampling steps , while line 14 represents the update of the multinomial distributions which are collapsed in the derivation of the sampling equations :

A single iteration of the sampler performs O((m + t ) · K ) computations and hence it is linear on the size of observed data . In Alg . 1 we assume that the number K of topics is given as input ; typically this value is determined experimentally as the number of topics that maximizes the predictive performances . However , it is possible to automatically devise the number of topics by relying on Bayesian nonparametrics . In fact , as shown in [ 7 ] , it is possible to adapt the sampling equations in order to make explicit the annihilation of some topics as well the generation of new ones , according to the Chinese Restaurant Process principle .

3.2 Producing explanations
The success of a recommender system does not only depend on its accuracy in inferring and exploiting users’ interests , but it also relies on how the deployed recommendations are perceived by the users . Explanations increase the transparency of the recommendation process and may positively contribute in gaining users’ trust and satisfaction .
When generating explanations for social recommendations , the first step is to understand if the proposed connection l = ( u , v ) is social ( ie , such that xl = 1 ) or topical
( ie , xl = 0 ) . WTFW provides a natural way to do this :
Pr(xl = 1|l , ⇥ ) /Xk Pr(xl = 0|l , ⇥ ) /Xk
⇡k k✓k,u✓k,v
⇡k(1    k)Sk,uAk,v ,
( 9 )
( 10 )
Social connections have a natural explanation in terms of close knit circles . Thus , for a given link l = ( u , v ) predicted as social ( ie , such that xl = 1 ) , we can provide an explanation as the set of the most prospective common neighbors , ranked according to the following score : rank(w ; l ) =Xk
⇡k k✓k,u✓k,v✓k,w .
( 11 )
This rank promotes common neighbors that have high degree of involvement in social communities where both u and v are involved as well . Interestingly , the score finds an explanation in terms of the probability of observing a social triangle among u , v and w . In fact , the joint probability of observing ( u , v ) , ( u , w ) and ( v , w ) within community k is proportional to ✓k,u✓k,v✓k,w . And , since by definition both ( u , w ) and ( v , w ) hold in the data , the score explain the prospective new link ( u , v ) in terms of the common neighbors which are more likely to devise a triangle in the data . Conversely , topical links can be explained through a list of attributes which are representative of the topics of interest by the current user and for which the recommended connection has high authority . For each feature common to the two nodes , we define the following score : rank(f ; l ) =Xk
⇡k(1    k) k,f Ak,v·
( ⌧kAk,u + ( 1   ⌧k)Sk,u ) .
( 12 )
Here , the latter term represents the topical involvement of the user u within community k . Again , the score has an interpretation in terms of the prospective triangle among ( u , v ) , ( u , f ) and ( v , f ) . Notice , however , that the directionality plays a role here , since we are only interested in those features for which v is authoritative .
The procedure for producing explanations for a recommended link is summarized in Alg . 2 . In short , the procedure predicts the nature ( either social or topical ) of the prospective link , hence providing the list of most prominent neighbors/common features .

4 . EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
In this section we report the empirical assessment of the proposed WTFW model on real networks . The experimentation is aimed at assessing the following :
• The accuracy of the model for what concerns both link prediction and label prediction , where the latter refers to the classification of a link as either social or topical . • The scalability and stability of the learning procedure , by studying learning time and performance varying the number of iterations of the Gibbs sampler .
• The quality of the associations between links and features , that we show by means of anecdotal evidence in the reconstruction of the data through the model .
Datasets . For our purposes we need datasets coming from social networking platforms in which links creation can be explained in terms of interest identity and/or personal social relations . This requirement is satisfied , among the others , by two popular social networking platforms , namely Twitter and Flickr . On both platforms , the underlying network is inherently directed to reflect interest of users towards important , and authoritative , information sources . Moreover , in these systems the role of users may naturally change with respect to di↵erent topics . The Twitter dataset we use is publicly available3 and it includes information from 973 ego networks crawled from the public API . The resulting network contains roughly 80 thousand nodes and 1.7 million directed links . Attribute information consists in all the hashtags ( eg #sanfrancisco ) and mentions ( eg @BarackObama ) , used by those users .
Flickr data has been obtained by querying Flickr public API in the time window 2004 2008 and then by performing forest fire sampling [ 16 ] on the resulting network . Features are generated by crawling all the tags used by each users . Flickr also contains a form of ground truth for the label prediction task . Specifically , for each link in the dataset there are two flags , namely friend and family , that a user can specify . We naturally interpret these flags as follows : a link is labeled as “ social ” if it is either marked as family or friend . Conversely , a link is “ topical ” if none of the two flags are set . It is important to stress that this ground truth is expectedly very noisy as it is any user declared information
3http://snapstanfordedu/data/egonets Twitterhtml on the internet . As such , it is likely to produce an underestimation of the accuracy in the label prediction task .
In order to keep the experimental setting as close as possible to the original data ( high dimensionality and exceptional sparsity ) , no further pre processing has been performed . Basic statistics about these two datasets are given in Table 2 . These datasets are characterized by di↵erent properties . The social graph in Twitter is much more directed and sparse than in Flickr , while the number of attributes per user is much higher in Flickr .

Experimental setting . In all the experiments we assume a partial observation of the network and a complete set of user features.4 The learning algorithm starts with a random assignments to latent variables , it performs a burn in phase ( burn in=500 ) to stabilize the Markov chain , and the parameters of the model are updated at regular intervals ( sampling lag=20 ) for the next 2000 iterations . We initialize hyperparameters with the following ( symmetric ) values : ↵ =   = ⌘ = 1 4.1 Model Assessment Evaluation on link prediction . In a first set of experiments , we measure the accuracy of the model in predicting new links . On Twitter , we perform a Monte Carlo CrossValidation in 5 folds , by randomly splitting the network into training and test data . We also measure the accuracy of the learned models for di↵erent proportions of training/test , namely 60/40 , 70/30 , 80/20 . This allows us to stress the robustness of the link prediction task for di↵erent proportions , and to mitigate the e↵ects of the random splits . In Flickr instead the dataset contains the timestamp of creation of the link , allowing us to perform a chronological split , where older links ( 70 % of the data ) are used for learning the model , while the most recent 30 % are used as prediction target .
The accuracy of link prediction is measured by computing the area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) over a set of positive and negative examples drawn from the test set . In principle , we can consider all links in the test set as positive examples , and all non existing links as negative example . However , the sparsity of the networks poses two major issues : ( i ) the number of non existing links can be enormous , thus making the computation of the AUC infeasible ; ( ii ) missing links do not necessarily represent negative information , but rather unseen information [ 28 ] . Following [ 1 ] , we thus limit the negative examples to all the 2 hops non existing links .
4The task of predicting/recommending missing features is not investigated here and it is left as future work .

Table 5 : AUC on link labeling Flickr .
We compare the performance of the WTFW model with some popular baseline approaches from the literature , which perform well on a range of networks [ 18 , 9 ] : Common Neighbors/Features ( CNF ) and Adamic Adar ( AA NF ) . CNF is a local similarity index that produces a score for each link ( u , v ) , which is given by the number of common neighbors/features : score(u , v ) = |N ( u ) \ N ( v)| + |F ( u ) \ F ( v)| .
AA NF represents a refinement of the simple counting of common neighbors/features , which is achieved by assigning more weight to less connected components . score(u , v ) = Xw2N ( u)\N ( v )

|N ( w)|
+ Xf2F ( u)\F ( v )

|V ( f )|
In addition , we compare WTFW with a matrix factorization approach based on SVD , dubbed Joint SVD ( JSVD ) [ 9 ] . In practice , the approach computes a low rank factorization of the joint adjacency/feature matrix X = [ E F ] as X ⇡ U · diag( 1 , . . . ,  K ) · VT , where K is the rank of the decomposition and  1 , . . . ,  K are the square roots of the K greatest eigenvalues of XT X . The matrices U and V provide substantial interpretation in terms of connectivity of both E and F . The term Uu,k can be interpreted as the tendency of u to be either a source in E or an adopter in F , relative to factor k . Analogously , Vu,k represents the tendency of u to appear as a destination in E , and Vf,k represents the likelihood that item f is adopted in k . The link prediction score can hence be computed as : score(u , v ) =
Uu,k kVv,k .
KXk=1
Tables 3 and 4 summarize the results of the evaluation , for increasing values of the number of latent topics/factors . On Twitter data , both WTFW and JSVD underperform when the number of latent factors is limited , but exhibit a competitive advange over the baselines for higher values of K . WTFW outperforms the other considered approaches and these results are stable on di↵erent training/test set proportions . The prediction on Flickr is in general weaker for all

However , the results seems stabler , since the difference with regards to JSVD remains constant for increasing values of K . The standard baselines perform poorly on this dataset . Figure 3 shows the slope of the ROC curves on both datasets for K = 256 . On Twitter , there are some limited areas where the JSVD is skewed but , in general , WTFW clearly outperforms the other methods . This is even more evident on the Flickr dataset . Evaluation on link labeling . We next turn our attention to the task of discriminating between social and topical links , thanks to the ground truth that we have in the Flickr dataset . Again , we measure the accuracy by computing the AUC on the prediction , and by comparing the result with a baseline based on common neighbors/features . That is , a link l = ( u , v ) is deemed social if the weight of the common neighbors is higher than those of the common features , and topical otherwise . Formally :
Pr(xl = 1|l ) =
.
|N ( u ) \ N ( v)|
|N ( u ) \ N ( v)| + |F ( u ) \ F ( v)|
Table 5 reports the results for increasing values of K . The best results are obtains on a lower number of topics , and in particular for K = 32 . This is somehow surprising if we compare this results with the results on link prediction discussed above . In an attempt to explain such a behavior , we analysed the values of ⇧ and   in the model , and we noticed that all models exhibit a strongly dominant latent factor . We will discuss this component also in the next subsection : it is worth mentioning , however that the associated probability  k leans towards 0.5 ( a clear sign that the community tends to mix topical and social contributions ) . Clearly , the balanced value of  k does not a↵ect the performance in link prediction ( as it only depends on whether any of the social/topical components is strong enough to trigger

Figure 6 : Changes in the matrices Ze , Zf , X and Y . the link ) , but it can negatively a↵ect the label prediction . The degradation of the performance for higher values of K can find a justification in the split of this giant component : apparently , the splitting seems to produce a reallocation of the links in the other communities , thus causing the overfitting . Besides this anomalous behavior , WTFW outperforms the baseline prediction for each considered value of K , as shown in Fig 4(a ) .
Scalability and sensitivity analysis . We next discuss how the model parameters a↵ect the learning time and the quality of the results . As already mentioned , we chose to perform 2 , 000 Gibbs sampling iterations . Figure 4 shows that the learning is substantially linear in the number of topics . Figure 5 shows the behavior of the log likelihood ( on the left ) and the AUC values on the validation data , along the iterations . We can see that , although the likelihood increases substantially , the improvements on the AUC is marginal , and the algorithm tends to converge to a stable accuracy value quite rapidly . Hence , limiting the number of iterations to 2 , 000 seems to be a good compromise between learning time and accuracy in prediction .
Finally , Figure 6 shows the percentage of relocations in latent factors assignments in the sampling steps of the Gibbs sampler , along iterations . After an initial phase , the latent factor matrices tend to become stable , except for the matrix X on Twitter , for which there is constant 25 % change along all iterations . Also , it is interesting to notice that the changes in Ze and Zf tend to be higher on Flickr .
4.2 Qualitative analysis
Figure 7 shows the block adjacency and feature matrices , where both users and features are grouped according to their likelihood to belong to each community . Specifically , for each user , we compute the probability Pr(k|u ) / is associated to community k as either source/destination of a connection , or as adopter of a feature . Analogously ,
Pk ⇡k Pr(u|k ) , where Pr(u|k ) is the probability that a user Pr(k|f ) /Pk ⇡k k,f represents the likelihood that the fea ture f is observed in the context of the community k . Each user/feature is then associated with the community k for which the probability is higher .
Darker colors in the block matrices denote higher relative density . As witnessed by the diagonal structure on the block adjacency matrix , the discovered communities capture neat patterns of connectivity among users . The joint analysis of the two block matrices supports the following findings .
• Connections in Twitter tend to be strongly topical ; each community is strongly characterized by a corresponding set of features . The only exception is given by two communities ( 4 and 15 ) in which associations tend to be looser ( and in fact the corresponding features tend to entropically spread along all communities ) .
• The connectivity behavior of users on Flickr is more social . The block adjacency matrix exhibits high density blocks , and by contrast the feature block matrix exhibits higher entropy . Apparently , it seems that there is not a strong characterization in terms of features for the detected communities . While few communities are specialized in a very limited set of features , a larger number of tags is popular in the remaining ones . The dominant community mentioned before , where most of the features association hold is very visible .
We next turn to a more qualitative analysis of the models produced . Here we consider the latent structure corresponding to K = 64 on Twitter and K = 32 on Flickr . These values are chosen for presentation readability sake .
The above hypotheses are supported by the analysis in Figure 8 , where we report for each community the percentage of users who qualify as either authoritative , susceptible or social . The authoritiveness score for the user u within k

Scores for measuring the degree of susceptibility and sociality can be computed likewise . Again , Twitter tends to exhibit a predominant amount of authorities/followers , whereas the great majority of the communities in Flickr tend to include social users . Finally , Figure 9 shows the estimated values of  k within the communities . As already observed before , Flickr tends to be more clearly social than Twitter . Moreover , the distinction between social and topical latent factors is very clear in Flickr with almost all communities having probability of being “ social ” either above 0.9 , or below 02 This discriminating attitude is even more evident when we increase the number of latent topics .
Finally , a further assessment of the correct identification of social and topical latent factors can be performed by measuring , for a given feature f , the probability of observing it in a social/topical context , computed as follows :
Pr(Social|f ) /Xk Pr(Topical|f ) /Xk
⇡k k k,f
⇡k(1    k) k,f .
In Table 6 we validate the accuracy of the feature labeling task on two small sets of tags . The first set contains keywords notably associated with social events , such as family , and wedding . The second set contains keywords specific to photographic techniques , eg hdr and polaroid , which are likely to generate topical interest in the users . The results confirm the capability of the model to discriminate between social and topical features .
Finally , Table 7 summarizes the top keywords detected by our approach on both datasets in some representative communities/topics : highly social communities ( large   ) have characteristic features ( eg , family , christmas on Flickr , and followback on Twitter ) which are clearly social .
5 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK This paper introduces WTFW , a novel stochastic generative model that jointly factorizes both social connections and feature associations . The model provides accurate link prediction and contextualized socio/topical explanations to support the predictions . Our approach is based on latent factors which can be interpreted as communities of people sharing a similar behavior , and on the explicit modeling of

Table 7 : Most representative features of selected communities . the underlying latent nature behind each observed connection . The result is a decoupling of social and topical connections to reflect the idea that social communities should have high density and reciprocal connections , whereas topical communities should exhibit clear directionality and a low entropy over user attributes .
Our work can be extended in several directions . First , we deliberately omitted to quantify the quality of the communities that the model produces . Some initial results based on modularity look promising ( we measured 0.55 and 0.37 on Twitter and Flickr , respectively ) . Also , the qualitative analysis in Section 4 clearly denotes the capability of the model to group users according to both connectivity and common features . However , we plan to devote to future work a more detailed treatment , as well a thorough comparison with other approaches in the literature .
Second , the approach explored in this paper is rooted on mixture membership topic modeling . However , other alternatives are possible , which can be based on probabilistic matrix factorization . We plan to explore and compare these di↵erent strategies in a future work .
