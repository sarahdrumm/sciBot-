ABSTRACT We study the interplay between a dynamic process and the structure of the network on which it is defined . Specifically , we examine the impact of this interaction on the qualitymeasure of network clusters and node centrality . This enables us to effectively identify network communities and important nodes participating in the dynamics . As the first step towards this objective , we introduce an umbrella framework for defining and characterizing an ensemble of dynamic processes on a network . This framework generalizes the traditional Laplacian framework to continuous time biased random walks and also allows us to model some epidemic processes over a network . For each dynamic process in our framework , we can define a function that measures the quality of every subset of nodes as a potential cluster ( or community ) with respect to this process on a given network . This subset quality function generalizes the traditional conductance measure for graph partitioning . We partially justify our choice of the quality function by showing that the classic Cheeger ’s inequality , which relates the conductance of the best cluster in a network with a spectral quantity of its Laplacian matrix , can be extended from the Laplacianconductance setting to this more general setting .

INTRODUCTION
Two fundamental problems in network analysis involve identifying central nodes and communities in a network . The goal of centrality identification is to find central or important nodes , for example , those that control the flow of information on the network . The objective of community detection is to discover subsets of well interacting nodes in a given network . Both of these graph mining approaches have tremendous applications in different areas , such as social network , biological network , World Wide Web analysis . For example , the centrality measure Page Rank [ 20 ] is one of the backbones of Google ’s search algorithm . Similarly , community detection or graph clustering is useful in potential drug target identification [ 29 ] .
The first step towards finding potentially meaningful communities is to define a quality function that measures the degree to which a subset of network nodes tend to interact among themselves . To this end , measures such as clustering coefficients , subgraph density , and conductance , were introduced to express the quality of a subset as a good cluster . Similarly , many measures of centrality including Page Rank and eigenvector centrality are used to discover important nodes . However , to define a useful quality or centrality function , one needs to determine how the network structure models the interaction among nodes . Unfortunately , this can be quite challenging and is often ignored . Indeed , the aforementioned measures apply different interpretations . As a result , current network analysis methods often make implicit assumptions about the dynamic processes ( and the resultant interaction ) among nodes and use these assumptions to define the quality of a cluster or centrality of a node .
Explicitly taking the dynamic process into account , a node ’s centrality at any time describes its participation in the flow taking place on the network [ 5 , 15 ] . Similarly , communities are groups of nodes that interact more frequently with each other ( according to the rules of the dynamic process ) than with nodes from other communities [ 16 ] . In fact , this view of modeling is not new . For instance , in choosing conductance as a measure of cluster quality , one may in fact implicitly assume that unbiased random walk is taking place on the network [ 12 , 26 , 8 , 9 ] . Under this assumption , a measure of centrality is the heat kernel page rank [ 6 ] .
Other dynamic processes such as the spread of information , ideas , or epidemics , induce different interactions from the unbiased random walks . An epidemic [ 13 ] is a stochastic process that , unlike a random walk , attempts to transition to ( ie , infect ) every neighbor of a node . Epidemic dynamics may be specified by the replicator operator [ 16 ] , whose stationary distribution defines eigenvector centrality [ 4 , 10 ] . It is natural to think that the centrality of a node depends on the specifics of the dynamic process , which together with the network topology influence its activity level . For example , nodes that are visited most frequently by a random walk ( specified by the heat kernel page rank ) are different from nodes that are infected most often during an epidemic ( specified by eigenvector centrality ) . Moreover , epidemics could lead to a different community formation of a network [ 16 ] .
Our Contributions .
We study the interplay between a dynamic process and the underlying network on which it unfolds . We focus on the impact of this interaction on the emergence of central nodes and the formation of communities in the network , and on the design of efficient algorithms for their identification . General framework for dynamic processes : We present an umbrella framework for describing dynamic processes on a network that generalizes the traditional Laplacian framework for diffusion and random walks . Recall that a random walk on a network is a stochastic dynamic process that transitions from a node to a random neighbor of that node . It defines a Markov chain that can be specified by the normalized Laplacian of the network . Our framework ( Section 2 ) attempts to capture the class of dynamic processes that evolve in time according to a rule that can be defined by generalizing the normalized Laplacian .
Formal analysis of interaction dynamics : Our framework defines a class of dynamic processes with relatively simple characterization parameters , which enables rigorous analysis of the impact of these parameters on the measures of the community quality and node centrality . Its inclusion of diffusion and random walks allows us to build on the insights from previous work on mathematical analysis of random walks , conductance measures for clustering , and spectral notions for centrality , in order to derive our generalization that reflects the interaction between the dynamic process and its underlying network . We are also able to use it to define new processes whose properties may offer useful insights into community finding and graph partitioning . Although this particular framework cannot express every dynamic process of interest , the generalization allows us to model some epidemic processes over a network . Thus , we can use these well established special cases ( such as random walks and epidemics ) to clarify the relationship between the parameters of the dynamic processes and their induced community qualities and centralities .
Generalized conductance : We extend conductance to a general quality measure for clusters that reflects the dynamic process on the network . For each dynamic process , we use its characterization parameters to define this function . It measures the quality of every subset ( of nodes ) as a potential cluster ( community ) with respect to this process on the given network . This subset quality measure generalizes traditional conductance and provides a continuous family of measures for subsets in a graph . Recall that , for each set S ⊂ V in a weighted graph G = ( V , E ) , the conductance of S , φG(S ) , is equal to the ratio of the degree of the connectivities between S to V − S to total degree of connectivities of S ( or the total degree of connectivities of V −S , whichever is smaller ) . As each subset quality function measures different degree to which a subset of nodes in a graph tend to cluster together and its coherence as a community , a comparative study of these subset measures could be useful in the design and evaluation of community detection algorithms .
Generalized Cheeger ’s inequality :
In both theory and practice , a basic problem in community detection is to justify why one quality function is better than another for modeling communities in a network . Unfortunately , this is a highly challenging problem for rigorous reasoning and justification . The interplay of dynamics and network topology further adds to its difficulty . In this paper , we will build on the wisdoms demonstrated in the past decades in spectral graph theory . To partially justify our choice of the quality function , we prove that the classical Cheeger ’s inequality can be extended to our generalized settings . Recall ( also see Section 3 ) that the Cheeger ’s inequality relates a spec tral quantity of the Laplacian matrix of the network to the conductance of the best cluster in the network . Particular , it shows that if λ is the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian matrix of G and S ⊂ V is a subset in G with the smallest conductance , then
( φG(S))2 /2 ≤ λ ≤ 2 · φG(S ) .

Centrality , quality and community : We will show that the same relation ( as in Eq 1 ) holds for the generalized conductance and the extreme eigenvalue of the linear operator for each dynamic process in our framework . Each function that measures community quality can then be used to decompose the network into potential communities .
In addition , like previous work in random walks , we can also relate the convergence to stationary distribution with the quality measure in each of the dynamics in this framework . For example , the time taken by the random walk to reach its stationary distribution is bounded by conductance [ 11 ] . The Cheeger inequality provides this connection via the extreme eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian . Similarly , using generalized Cheeger inequalities , we also show that the time it takes for each of the dynamic processes to reach its stationary is bounded by the corresponding quality function .
Efficient spectral and local partitioning algorithms : Like previous studies in Laplacian based spectral graph theory , such as Spielman Teng [ 26 ] , Andersen Chung Lang [ 2 ] , and Andersen Peres [ 3 ] , our analysis also leads to efficient spectral and local algorithms for identifying provably good clusters based on these new quality functions .
We hope this study will help lead to better approaches for defining and understanding the general interaction between dynamics and networks . Due to lack of space we are unable to provide the proofs of many theorems in this paper , which will be available in the extended version of this paper .
2 . DYNAMIC PROCESSES ON NETWORKS We represent a network as a weighted , undirected graph G = ( V , E , A ) , where for i , j ∈ V , A[i , j ] = ai,j assigns an ( affinity ) non negative weight to each edge . We follow the tradition that ai,j = 0 if and only if ( i , j ) 6∈ E ; ie , A is the weighted adjacency matrix . By convention we assume it is symmetric and ai,i = 0 for all i ∈ V . In the discussion below , the ( weighted ) degree of node i ∈ V is defined as the total weight of edges incident on it , that is , di =Pj ai,j . 2.1 A Family of Dynamic Processes
In a dynamic process , each network node i has a dynamic variable θi associated with it , which can change its value based on interactions with its neighbors . The values of the variables evolve in time according to the rules of the dynamic process . We consider linear dynamic processes of the kind : dθ dt
= −Lθ ,
( 2 ) where θ is a column vector containing the θ entries and L is a symmetric positive semi definite matrix , the spreading operator , which defines the details of the dynamic process . As discussed in the introduction , we focus on dynamic processes on a network that generalize the traditional normalized Laplacian for diffusion and random walks . Recall that the symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix of a weighted graph G = ( V , E , A ) is defined as
D−1/2(D − A)D−1/2 , where D is the diagonal matrix defined by ( d1 , , dn ) . We study the properties of a dynamic process whose spreading operator can be written as :
W T −1/2 .
L = T −1/2D−1/2
W ( DW − W )D−1/2
( 3 ) Here T is the n × n diagonal matrix of node delay factors . Its ith diagonal element τi represents the average delay of node i . Another generalization from the traditional Laplacian is the use of the interaction matrix W instead of the adjacency matrix A . In theory , W can be any n × n symmetric positive definite matrix ; however , here we restrict our attention to scaling transformations of the adjacency matrix A . We also assume that the spreading operator is properly scaled : specifically , we assume that τi ≥ 1 , for all i ∈ V . Note that the degree matrix DW is now also defined in terms of the interaction matrix , that is dW i =Pj wi,j . We name this spreading operator the generalized Laplacian .
We study how the interplay between dynamics and topology affects clustering as T and W vary . For a better intuition , it helps to consider the random walk Laplacian matrix :
LRW = ( DW − W )D−1
W T −1 .
This matrix is similar to our symmetric normalized Laplacian matrix , with identical spectral properties . As its name indicates , this operator defines a continuous time unbiased random walk on the interaction graph W , which according to [ 15 ] is equivalent to biased random walks on the original adjacency matrix A . Under this interpretation , τi is the mean delay time of the random walk on node i before a transition , assuming a simple Poisson process . This intuition leads to two orthogonal parametrizations of a dynamic process : namely W controls the distribution of walk trajectories and T controls the delay time of node transitions along each trajectory . While we use symmetric operators for mathematical convenience in definitions and proofs , it is more intuitive to think from the random walk perspective . While the generalized Laplacian does not cover all dynamic processes of interest , this family of spreading operators includes some well known ones , such as the Laplacian or normalized Laplacian , as well as a continuous family of new operators that are not as well studied . It also contains certain operators for modeling epidemics . The consideration of this family of operators is also partially motivated by our recent experimental work in understanding network centrality [ 10 , 16 ] . We conclude this subsection with some special cases that can be described in this framework .
Normalized Laplacian .
If the interaction matrix is the original adjacency matrix W = A , and node delay factor is simply the identity matrix T = I , then we recover the normalized symmetric Laplacian :
L = I − D−1/2AD−1/2 .
( Scaled ) Graph Laplacian .
When W = A , T = dmaxD−1 , the spreading operator corresponds to the ( scaled ) graph Laplacian
L =
1 dmax
( D − A ) .
This operator is often used to describe heat diffusion like processes .
Replicator .
Let v be the eigenvector of A associated with its largest eigenvalue λmax : Av = λmaxv . We can then construct a diagonal matrix V whose elements are the components of the eigenvector V . Let us scale the adjacency matrix according to W = V AV and use it as the interaction matrix . Setting the node delay factor to identity , the spreading operator is :
L = I − D−1/2
W W D−1/2
W = I −
1
λmax
A
This operator is known as the replicator matrix R , and it models epidemic diffusion on a graph [ 16 ] . It is simply the normalized Laplacian of the interaction graph V AV [ 24 ] . Using the random walk intuition , an unbiased random walk on this interaction graph is equivalent to a maximum entropy random walk on the original graph given by the adjacency matrix A [ 15 ] .
Unbiased Adjacency Matrix .
Reweighing each edge by the inverse of square root of the degrees of the endpoints gives W = D−1/2AD−1/2 . Then , the degree of node i in the scaled graph is dW i = W gives a unbiased adjacency matrix :
Pj∈V W [ i , j ] . Letting T = dW maxD−1 ( DW − W ) . dW max
L =
1
Similarly , many other operators can be expressed using this framework .
2.2 Network Dynamics and Centrality
Before considering the impact of spreading operators on communities , we first examine the node centralities of each operator at any time , and their stationary distribution after convergence . The community quality functions that we use are partially inspired by the stationary distribution .
Solution of Equation 2 gives the weight distribution of the dynamic process across nodes at any time based on the initial weight distribution . In the rest of the paper , for convenience we will refer to this instantaneous distribution θ(t ) as time dependent centrality . Its stationary distribution is the conventional stationary centrality , or centrality for short .
θ(t ) = e−Lt · θ0 =
( −t)k k!
Lkθ0
∞
Xk=0
( 4 )
If the dynamic process converges when starting from θ0 , then limt→∞ θ(t ) is proportional to π :
For example , the stationary distribution of R is v , also known as the eigenvector centrality . Eigenvector centrality was introduced by Bonacich [ 4 ] to explain the importance of actors in a social network based on the importance of the actors to which they were connected , and it gives the stationary distribution of a simple epidemic at the epidemic threshold [ 27 , 10 ] .

2.3 Network Dynamics and Communities
In network clustering and community detection , one would like to identify subsets of nodes S ⊆ V that are more similar , or behave more similarly , to each other than to nodes in other subsets . A standard approach to clustering involves defining an objective function that measures the quality of a cluster . For a subset S ⊆ V , let ¯S = V \ S to denote the complement of S , which consists of nodes that are not in S . Let cut(S , ¯S ) =Pi∈S,j∈ ¯S ai,j denote the total affinity world . Let vol(S ) = Pi∈ di = Pi∈S,j∈V ai,j denote the weights of all edges used by S to connect with the outside volume of all affinity weights involving vertices in S .
One popular heuristic to measure the quality of a subset S as a potential good cluster ( or a community ) [ 12 , 26 , 8 ] is to use the ratio of these two quantities : cut(S , ¯S )
φ(S ) = min(vol(S ) , vol( ¯S ) )
( 6 )
For example , a subset that ( approximately ) minimizes this quantity — the conductance of S — is a desirable cluster , as it maximizes the fraction of affinities within the subset . If interactions among nodes are proportional to their affinity weights , then a set with small conductance also means that its members interact significantly more with each other than with members not in the subset . Other well known quality functions are normalized cut [ 23 ] and ratio cut , given by cut(S , ¯S ) vol(S )
+ cut(S , ¯S ) vol( ¯S ) and cut(S , ¯S ) min(|S| , | ¯S| )
, respectively . The smallest achievable such ratio is known as the isoperimetric number .
Algorithmically , once a quality function is selected , one can then perform a partitioning based algorithm or mathematical programming based method to find a cluster or clusters that optimizes the quality function .
For the Normalized Laplacian paradigm ( or when the underlying process is a random walk ) , there exists a relationship between clustering and dynamics : in a good ( ie , low conductance cut ) cluster , a random walk starting within a cluster seldom transitions outside the cluster [ 17 , 23 , 22 , 26 ] . Therefore , the presence of a good cluster implies that it will take a random walk a long time to reach its stationary distribution . We generalize this notion with a claim that every dynamic process has an associated function that measures the quality of the cluster with respect to that process . Optimizing the quality function leads to cohesive communities , ie , groups of nodes that the dynamic process seldom leaves .
Generalized Conductance .
Consider a dynamic process defined by a spreading operW T −1/2 . For a set ator L = T −1/2D−1/2
W ( DW − W )D−1/2
S ⊆ V , let volL(S ) = Pi∈S dW iτi be the generalized vol ume under our framework . We define the quality of a set S with respect to L as : hL(S ) =
=
We also define , cut(S , ¯S ) min,volL(S ) , volL( ¯S)Pi∈S,j∈ ¯S wi,j min,Pi∈S dW iτi,Pi∈¯S dW iτi
φL = min
S hL(S )
( 7 )
( 8 )
Using the random walk perspective , the numerator measures the random jumps across communities , while the denominator ensures a balanced bisection . The generalized volume can be interpreted as the total time a random walk stays within a community after convergence , as it is proportional to both node degrees and node delay factors .
Below , we summarize the induced special cases discussed in the previous subsection .
Normalized Laplacian .
W = A and T = I , and hence hL(S ) is the conductance .
( Scaled ) Graph Laplacian .
W = A and T = dmaxD−1 , hence hL(S ) = cut(S , ¯S ) min(dmax|S| , dmax| ¯S| )
=
1 dmax · cut(S , ¯S ) min(|S| , | ¯S| )
,
This is the ratio cut scaled by 1/dmax .
Replicator .
W = V AV and T = I . Recall v is the eigenvector of W associated with the largest eigenvalue λmax . The redefined hL(S ) = cut size is Pi∈S,j∈ ¯S fij =Pi∈S,j∈ ¯S vivj . Therefore , i ,Pi∈¯S v2 i
Pi∈S,j∈¯S vivj λmax min,Pi∈S v2
Since the degree of a node in an interaction graph is dW i = i , the generalized conductance of the Replicator is simply the conductance of the interaction graph [ 24 ] .
Pj fij = λmaxv2
Unbiased Adjacency Matrix .
W = D−1/2AD−1/2 . and T = dW maxD−1
W . The associ ated quality function is hL(S ) =
1 dW max · Pi∈S,j∈ ¯S ai,j√didj min(|S| , | ¯S| )
.
We call this quality function unbiased cohesion .
3 . GENERALIZED CHEEGER’S INEQUAL
ITY AND SPECTRAL PARTITIONING
Cheeger inequality states that
φ2 G/2 ≤ λ1 ≤ 2φG where λ1 is the second largest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian , L = I− D−1/2W D−1/2 , and φG is conductance . The relationship between conductance and spectral properties of the Laplacian enables the use of its eigenvectors for partitioning graphs , particularly the nearest neighborhood graphs and finite element meshes [ 25 ] .
In this section , we generalize Cheeger ’s inequality to any spreading operator under our framework and its associated generalized conductance ( given by Eq 8 ) . Our generalization of Cheeger ’s inequality comes with algorithmic consequences . It leads to spectral partitioning algorithms that are efficient in finding low conductance cuts for a given operator . 3.1 Generalized Cheeger Inequality
Theorem 1 . ( Generalized Cheeger Inequality )
Consider the dynamic process described by a ( properly scaled ) spreading operator L = T −1/2D−1/2 W T −1/2 . Let λ0 ≤ λ1 ≤ ≤ λn−1 be the eigenvalues of L . Then λ0 = 0 and λ1 satisfies the following inequalities :
W ( DW −W )D−1/2
φL(G)2/2 ≤ λ1 ≤ 2φL(G ) where φL(G ) is given by Eq 8 .
Proof . We prove the theorem by following the approach for proving the classic Cheeger ’s inequality ( see [ 8] ) .
Let ( τ1 , , τn ) be the diagonal entries of T . Note that v0 = T 1/2D1/2 W · 1 , where 1 denotes the vector of all 1 ’s , is an eigenvector of L associated with eigenvalue λ0 = 0 . Let volL(S ) = Pi∈S diτi for S ⊆ V , where for clarity we abuse the notation di and use it as dW i . Suppose f is the eigenvector associated with λ1 . Then , f ⊥ v0 . Consider vector g such that g[u ] = f [ u]/√duτu . The fact that f ⊥ v0 then implies Xv g[v]dvτv = 0 . Then ,
φL(G ) = min
S min(volL(S ) , volL( ¯S ) ) cut(S , ¯S )
λ1 = f T Lf f T f

√duτu − f [ v ] Pv f [ v]2
√dv τv2
Pv g[v]2dvτv wu,v
Instead of sweeping the vertices of G according to the eigenvector f itself , we sweep the vertices of the graph G according to g by ordering the vertices of G so that g[v1 ] ≥ g[v2 ] ≥ ··· ≥ g[vn ] and consider sets Si = {v1,·· · , vi} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n . Similar to [ 8 ] , we will eventually only consider the first “ half ” of the sets Si during the sweeping : Let r denote the largest integer such that volL(Sr ) ≤ volL(V )/2 . Note that
Xv = Xv
( g[v ] − g[vr])2dvτv g[v]2dvτv + g[vr]2dvτv ≥Xv g[v]2dvτv . where the first equation follows from Pv g[v]dvτv = 0 . We denote the positive and negative part of g − g[vr ] as g+ and g− respectively :
0 , g+[v ] =(g[v ] − g[vr ] , g−[v ] =(|g[v ] − g[vr]| ,
0 , if g[v ] ≥ g[vr ] . otherwise . if g[v ] ≤ g[vr ] . otherwise .
( 9 )
( 10 )
Now
λ1 = Pu,v∈V ( g[u ] − g[v])2wu,v
Pv g[v]2dvτv Pv(g+[v]2 + g−[v]2)dvτv
≥ Pu,v∈V ( g+[u ] − g+[v])2wu,v + ( g−[u ] − g−[v])2wu,v ≥ minP(g+[u ] − g+[v])2wu,v , P(g−[u ] − g−[v])2wu,v Pv g−[v]2dvτv
Without loss of generality , we assume the first ratio is at most the second ratio , and will mostly focus on the vertices
Pv g+[v]2dvτv
{v1 , , vr} in the first “ half ” of the graph in the analysis below . Thus , λ1 ≥ Pu,v(g+[u ] − g+[v])2wu,v +[u ] − g2
Pv g+[v]2dvτv Pu,v(g2
+[v])wu,v2
,Pv g+[v]2dvτv Pu,v(g+[u ] + g+[v])2wu,v
≥ which follows from the Cauchy Schwartz inequality .
We now separately analyze the numerator and denominator . To bound the denominator , we will use the following property of τi : Because L is properly scaled , τi ≥ 1 for all i ∈ V . Therefore , Xu,v
+[u ] + g2
+[v])wu,v
2(g2
( g+[u ] + g+[v])2wu,v ≤ Xu,v = 2Xu∈V ≤ 2Xu∈V +[u]duτu!2 g2
2 Xu∈V
.
Hence , the denominator is at most g2 +[u]du g2 +[u]duτu .
To bound the numerator , we consider subsets of nodes Si = {v1,··· , vi} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r and define S0 = ∅ . First note that volL(Si ) − volL(Si−1 ) = dvi τvi .
( 11 ) By the definition of φL(G ) , we know φL(G ) ≤ mini hL(Si ) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r , where recall the function hS(L ) is defined by Eq 7 . Since volL(Si ) ≤ volL( ¯Si ) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ r , we have cut(Si , ¯Si ) ≥ φL · volL(Si )
( 12 )
By orienting vertices according to v1 , , vn , we can ex press the numerator
Num = Xu,v = Xi<j = n−1 Xi=1,g2

By Eqn . 11 and g+(vn ) = 0

+[vi ] · dvi τi!2
.
Combining the bounds for the numerator and the denominator , we obtain λ1 ≤ φ2 L/2 as stated in the theorem . The right hand side of the theorem follows from the same argument for the standard Cheeger Inequality .
To use this spectral approximation algorithm ( and in fact any numerical approximation to the second eigenvector of L ) in our spectral partitioning algorithm for the dynamics , we will need a strengthened theorem of Theorem 1 .
3.2 Spectral Partitioning for Generalized Con ductance
Given a weighted graph G = ( V , E , A ) and a operator L , we can use the standard sweeping method in the proof of Theorem 1 to find a partition ( S , ¯S ) . This procedure is described in Algorithm 1 .
Algorithm 1 Spectral Dynamics Clustering ( G , L ) Input : weighted network : G = ( V , E , A ) , and spreading operator L defined by the interaction matrix W and the node delay factor T . Output partition : ( S , ¯S ) Algorithm

• Sweeping : For each Si = {v1 , , vi} , compute . min,volL(Si ) , volL( ¯Si)• Output the Si with the smallest hL(Si ) . cut(Si , ¯Si ) hL(Si ) =
Before stating the quality guarantee of the above algorithm , we quickly discuss its implementation and running time . The most expensive step is the computation of the eigenvalue vector f associated with the second smallest eigenvalue of L . While one can use standard numerical methods to find an approximation of this eigenvector – the analysis would depend on the separation of the second and the third eigenvalue of L . Since L is a diagonally scaled normalized Laplacian matrix , one can use the nearly linear time Laplacian solvers ( eg , by Spielman Teng [ 26 ] or Koutis MillerPeng [ 14 ] ) to solve linear systems in L .
Following [ 26 ] , let us consider the following notion of spectral approximation of L : Suppose λ1(L ) the second smallest eigenvalue of L . For ǫ ≥ 0 , ¯f is an ǫ approximate second eigenvector of L if ¯f ⊥ D1/2T 1/2 · 1 , and
T L ¯f ¯f T ¯f ≤ ( 1 + ǫ ) · λ1(L ) . ¯f
The following proposition follows directly from the algorithm and Theorem 7.2 of [ 26 ] ( using the solver from [ 14] ) .
Proposition 1 . For any interaction graph G = ( V , E , W ) and node scaling factor T , and ǫ , p > 0 , with probability at least 1− p , one can compute an ǫ approximate second eigenvector of operator L in time
O ( |E| log n log log n log(1/p ) log(1/ǫ)/ǫ ) .
Theorem 2 . ( Extended Cheeger Inequality with Respect to Rayleigh Quotient ) For any interaction graph G = ( V , E , W ) and node scaling factor T , ( whose diagonals are ( τ1 , , τn) ) , for any vector u such that u ⊥ D1/2T 1/2 · 1 , if we order the vertices of G into ( v1 , , vn ) such that g[v1 ] ≥ ≥ g[vn ] , where g = ( DT )−1/2 · u then

The next theorem then follows directly from Proposition 1 , Theorem 2 and the definition of ǫ approximate second eigenvector of L that provide a guarantee of the quality of the algorithm of this subsection .
Theorem 3 . For any interaction graph G = ( V , E , W ) and node scaling factor T , ( whose diagonals are ( τ1 , , τn) ) , one can compute in time

4 . LOCAL CLUSTERING ALGORITHMS In the analysis of massive networks , it is essential to identify subsets of nodes whose induced sub graphs have “ significant ” structural coherence without examining the entire network . Using clustering as an example , Spielman and Teng [ 26 ] introduced a framework of local algorithms for network analysis : given an input node , a local algorithm can only explore the neighbors of the nodes it has already accessed . It may occasionally access some random nodes in the network . The complexity of the local algorithm is then measured by the total number of accesses it makes , as well as the computations it performs .
In spite of lacking global access , Spielman and Teng showed that local algorithms can be effective in identifying good clusters when conductance is used as quality measure . Their work was subsequently improved by Andersen Chung Lang [ 2 ] , Andersen Pere [ 3 ] , and Chung [ 6 , 7 ] . Chung [ 6 , 7 ] applied the sweeping method to the heat kernal page rank to identify a random walk based local cluster . Similarly , we propose a dynamic dependent sweeping procedure to discover a local cluster of provably good generalized conductance . Due to length limit , we only state relevant theorems in this paper . For details of proofs , please refer to the full version on arXiv . 4.1 Convergence and Local hL Clustering
For an starting vector µ , let θt,µ[i ] denote the value of the dynamics of vertex i ∈ V at time t when the initial vector is µ . In other words , θt,µ = ( θt,µ[1 ] , , θt,µ[n ] ) is the solution of Eq 4 with θ0 = µ .
Let π = ( π[1 ] , , π[n ] ) denote
π =pdW 1τ1 , ,pdW nτn .
If the dynamic process converges when starting from µ , then limt→∞ θt,µ is proportional to π , ie , for a constant z depending only on µ , lim t→∞
θt,µ[i ] = zµ · π[i ] = zµ ·pdW iτi .
( 13 )
We will also use πµ to denote limt→∞ θt,µ .
In this spirit , we define the fractional volume of a subset
√dW iτi Pj √dW j τj
S ⊆ V be fvolL(S ) = Pj∈SpdW j τj . Following the analysis of Theorem 1 , let τmin = mini τi , τmax = maxi τi and for i ∈ S and is 0 otherwise . Like in µS[i ] = the traditional Laplacian conductance framework , we will establish that the existence of a community S ⊂ V with small hL(S ) underscores why the dynamics may not converge rapidly from the inital distribution .
We examine the evolution of the dynamics defined by a network G = ( V , E , A ) and a spreading operator L . Particularly , we are interested in estimating the rate that the dynamic process converges to its stationary distribution from some initial distribution , and its relation to the generalized conductance hL that we defined ( Eqn . ( 7) ) . As each dynamic process leads to its own notion of ( time dependent ) centrality , we will study and compare the corresponding community structures by its generalized conductance .
Our local clustering algorithm ( Algorithm 2 ) explores this interplay . Here we assume the starting vector µu is seeded in a single node u , ie , it has a single one entry for node u , and other entries are all zeros . Next theorem provides a performance guarantee for the local algorithm .

Theorem 4 follows from our proofs in the following subsection 3 together with Andersen Chung Lang ’s analysis [ 2 ] of the push based approximation scheme . Similar to its global counterpart in Theorem 3 , Theorem 4 uses Theorem 2 in place of Theorem 1 to address the approximation of the dynamic process . During the approximate dynamic process with the Andersen Chung Lang push scheme , only O(1/ǫ ) nodes have non zero entries .

Following the intuition of the proof of the extended Cheeger inequality ( Theorem 1 ) and the traditional Laplacian analysis [ 17 , 26 , 8 , 7 ] , we consider a sweeping process based on the time dependent centrality with starting vertex u . At time t , the sweeping is performed according to
θt,u[v1 ] √dW 1τ1 ≥
θt,u[v2 ] √dW 2τ2 ≥ ··· ≥
θt,u[vn ] √dW nτn by considering St,u[i ] = {v1,· ·· , vi} . Like in Chung [ 6 ] , for a targeted size s , we define the s local hL value denoted by κt,u,s as : κt,u,s = mini:fvolL(St,u[i])≤2s hL(St,u[i] ) .

Through experiments we demonstrate the difference in the centralities and communities detected in a graph under different dynamic processes . Interestingly , even this simple class of processes can lead to divergent views about who the central nodes are and what are the cohesive clusters for a collection of widely studied real world networks .
We study how the dynamic processes defined in this paper affect centrality and spectral partitioning . Our framework actually offers more freedom in designing node delay factor T and the interaction graph W and is thus a much more powerful tool . We will study these possibilities in greater detail and use the proposed local clustering algorithm for real world applications in future work .
Table 1 lists the networks we study empirically , and their properties . We treat all networks as undirected . These networks come from different domains , and embody a variety of dynamic processes and interactions , from real world friendships ( Zachary karate club [ 30] ) , to social network ( Facebook [ 18] ) , to electrical power distribution ( Power Grid [ 28] ) , to intra text ( Word Adjacency [ 19 ] ) and inter text ( Political Blogs [ 1 ] ) links .
The House of Representatives network is built from the 98th United States House of Representatives voting data [ 21 ] . Unlike the previously studied variants , here we use a special version taking account of all 908 votes . The resulting network is dense and has an unusually flat degree distribution . Originally analyzed by Smith et al . [ 24 ] , this network better differentiates between the dynamics under our framework . 5.1 Centrality Profiles
We first study node ( stationary ) centrality rankings resulting from different dynamic processes . By construction , centrality of a node converges to Eq 5 . Given a graph , the degree sequence is fixed , and stationary centrality depends solely on the node delay factor T . A centrality profile is a curve of stationary centrality values for each node given a spreading operator . Figure 1 shows the centrality profiles of network nodes . To improve visualization , nodes are ordered by their centrality according to the normalized Laplacian matrix , and they are rescaled to fall within the same range . Except for “ House of Representatives ” and “ Power Grid ” networks , the centrality profiles on the other four data sets are very similar . They all have heavy tailed degree distributions , thus their centralities under the normalized Laplacian

A toy social network A disassortative network A dense network with even degrees Has two “ cores ” with “ whiskers ” Combined ego networks A large sparse network behave similarly . Replicator centralities follow largely the same trend . There are important differences , however . For example , in the “ House of Representatives ” network , nodes in the range [ 1 , 50 ] considered to be highly central according to the normalized Laplacian are judged not as important by the Replicator . Since centralities and communities are closely related under our framework , this would eventually lead to the differences in community detection , as we show in the next subsection . The centrality scores of nodes in the “ Power Grid ” network are all the same except for a few nodes . The lack of information comes from the extreme sparsity of the network . 5.2 Communities and Sweep Profiles
We use the sweep profile to study differences in network partitioning using different spreading operators for the real world networks listed in Table 1 . Given a spreading operator , a sweep profile is a curve of quality functions following Algorithm 1 . Let f be the eigenvector associated with the second smallest eigenvalue of L . The vertices are ordered ( v1 , , vn ) such that g[v1 ] ≥ ≥ g[vn ] where g[u ] = f [ u]/√dW uτu . The x axis plots Si = {v1 , , vi} . The y axis plots hL(Si ) = cut(Si , ¯Si ) min,volL(Si ) , volL( ¯Si )
.
The smallest hL(Si ) gives a provably good cluster Si according to Theorem 3 .

Figure 3 : Sweep profiles for different networks
Sweep profiles produced according to Algorithm 1 on all six networks . The x axes indicate the sweep point , or community size of one of the bi sections . On the logarithmic y axes , the quality function has been normalized to the same range for all dynamics on each network .
Figure 3 shows the sweep profile for each network under different dynamics . To improve visualization , we rescale community profiles to lie within the same range . Sweep profiles provide us an interesting perspective into the differences in the communities identified according to different dynamics . With the exception of Zachary ’s karate club , there are large differences both in the shape of the profile and , more importantly , in the location of its minimum , which corresponds to the optimal bisection of the network .
In the “ Political Blogs ” network , both regular and normalized versions of Laplacian split a “ whisker ” community from the core ( Left of Figure 2 ) . However , the Replicator identifies a community of more than 500 nodes ( Right of Figure 2 ) . While Replicator is less susceptible to “ whiskers ” , on the “ Power Grid ” and “ Facebook Egonets ” networks , it only identifies small communities within the “ core ” . Instead , unbiased adjacency succeeds in finding more balanced cuts of the networks . In the “ House of Representatives ” network , the Replicator puts “ swing nodes ” into a different community from the other operators . Recall that this difference was also reflected in its centrality profiles . In future work , we plan to analyze the reasons behind these differences in more detail and in a dynamic setting .
6 . CONCLUSION
The dynamics of a process occurring on a network can be succinctly described in terms of a spreading operator . The generalized Laplacian operator presented in this paper can describe the spreading operators associated with known processes , such as random walks and epidemics , but also new ones , such as the unbiased adjacency . We generalize the relationships between the properties of random walks and normalized graph Laplacian , to other dynamic processes . Each operator leads to a distribution that gives centrality of nodes with respect to that process . In addition , we show that the generalized conductance measuring community quality with respect to the dynamic process is related to the eigenvalues of the spreading operator describing that process through a Cheeger like inequality . These relationships can be used for spectral graph partitioning . Nodes within the same partition interact more with each other via the dynamic process than with nodes in other partitions . As in previous local clustering algorithms of Spielman Teng , Andersen Chung Lang and Andersen Peres [ 26 , 3 , 2 ] , the mathematical structure underlying the generalized Cheeger ’s inequality enables efficient local clustering algorithms for the more general community qualities , whose running time is essentially linear in the size of the cluster it outputs , and does not depend on the size of the whole graph .
While our framework is flexible enough to represent several important types of dynamic processes , it does not represent all possible processes , for example , those that are locally non conservative . In order to describe such dynamics , an even more general framework is needed . We conjecture , however , that the more general spreading operators will still obey the Cheeger like inequality , and that other theorems presented in this paper can be extended to these processes .
