ABSTRACT With the rapid growth of Web 2.0 , a variety of content sharing services , such as Flickr , YouTube , Blogger , and TripAdvisor etc , have become extremely popular over the last decade . On these websites , users have created and shared with each other various kinds of resources , such as photos , video , and travel blogs . The sheer amount of user generated content varies greatly in quality , which calls for a principled method to identify a set of authorities , who created high quality resources , from a massive number of contributors of content . Since most previous studies only infer global authoritativeness of a user , there is no way to differentiate the authoritativeness in different aspects of life ( topics ) .
In this paper , we propose a novel model of Topic specific Authority Analysis ( TAA ) , which addresses the limitations of the previous approaches , to identify authorities specific to given query topic(s ) on a content sharing service . This model jointly leverages the usage data collected from the sharing log and the favorite log . The parameters in TAA are learned from a constructed training dataset , for which a novel logistic likelihood function is specifically designed . To perform Bayesian inference for TAA with the new logistic likelihood , we extend typical Gibbs sampling by introducing auxiliary variables . Thorough experiments with two real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TAA in topic specific authority identification as well as the generalizability of the TAA generative model .

INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade , we have been witnessing the explosion of Web 2.0 applications . In the new era of Web 2.0 , web users are participating not only as passive consumers of content provided by websites , but also as contributors creating content collaboratively with fellow users , commonly referred to as user generated content . With the rapid growth

†The University of Hong Kong Pokfulam Road , Hong Kong †{kao , cwan}@cshkuhk of Web 2.0 , a variety of content sharing services , such as Flickr 1 , YouTube 2 , Blogger 3 , and TripAdvisor 4 etc , have become tremendously popular over the recent years . These websites enable users to create and share with each other various kinds of resources , such as photos , videos , and travel blogs , etc .
The sheer amount of user generated content made available by the content sharing services can be both a blessing and a curse . From the point of user modeling , richer information content helps to build more accurate user profiles , leading to better services for consumers . On the other hand , the vast quantity of user generated content available can often complicate the decision making process , as consumers do not have the time or ability to examine all data or compare all options [ 3 ] . On a content sharing website , the overwhelming resources vary greatly in quality , which result in confusion , sub optimum decisions or dissatisfaction with choices made by users [ 27 ] . Therefore , it is highly significant to develop a principled method that identifies a set of authorities , who created quality assured resources , from a massive number of contributors of content .
A lot of work has been done on authority identification in the context of social network and web structure analysis . However , most of these studies , such as typical PageRank , only infer global authoritativeness of each user , without assessing the authoritativeness in a particular aspect of life ( topics ) [ 24 , 21 , 11 , 30 ] . It does not make sense for a user to find global authorities on a content sharing website . After all , each user has unique topical interest . For example , on Flickr , a user who is interested in photographing sunsets may look for an photographers expert in this specific topic and learn from her photos about the skill of sunset photography . On the other hand , no one is an authority on every topic . Clearly , topic specific authority analysis provides a more detailed authoritativeness portfolio for a user , which is critical for authority identification on content sharing services .
A common way of distilling latent topics is to build a probabilistic topic model on the usage data collected from a sharing log . In a content sharing website , a sharing log stores users’ posting and tagging history , as illustrated by Figure 1 in Section 3 . However , the sharing log does not contain any information about the content quality of resources , based on which authorities are identified . It would be counterintu

Therefore , a data source in addition to the sharing log is clearly needed . Luckily , a favorite log made available by a content sharing website provides a valuable signal for the derivation of the content quality of resources . On current content sharing services , a resource is often presented with a favorite button , which a user clicks if he or she likes the resource . A favorite click represents an endorsement of the content quality of the resource by the user . The favorite log records the set of favorite clicks as user feedback , as illustrated by Figure 2 in Section 3 .
Despite considerable research on the sharing log for various applications , little is known about the emerging favorite log . It is nontrivial to leverage a favorite log for topic specific authority analysis in that users do not explicitly specify their topical motivates under the favorite clicks . A statistical model , built upon both the sharing log and the favorite log , is imperative to uncover each user ’s authoritativeness on different topics .
In this paper , we propose a novel Bayesian model to identify a list of authorities on given topic(s ) , which we refer to as Topic specific Authority Analysis , abbreviated as TAA . The TAA model characterizes each user ’s topical authoritativeness by introducing a user specific random vector over latent topics . To assess the topical authoritativeness , TAA exploits favorite clicks through systematically modeling the associations among users’ interest and authoritativeness as well as the topics of favorited resources . We propose to learn the parameters in the TAA model from a training dataset of observations constructed from both usage logs . To this end , a novel logistic likelihood function specialized for the training set is proposed to relate the parameters to the observations . Bayesian inference for a model with a logistic likelihood has long been recognized as a hard problem . We extend typical collapsed Gibbs sampling by introducing auxiliary variables to overcome this problem . With the inferred parameters , an analysis framework is introduced to produce an ordered list of topic specific authorities by their authoritativeness degrees that satisfy the user ’s query intent .
The major contributions of our work are summarized as follows :
1 . We propose a novel Bayesian model , TAA , to address the new problem of topic specific authority analysis on content sharing services by jointly leveraging the two data sources : sharing log and favorite log .
2 . We propose a principled approach to training dataset construction , in which a novel logistic likelihood function is introduced .
3 . We extend classic collapsed Gibbs sampling by data augmentation to infer the parameters in the TAA model with the new logistic likelihood .
4 . We conducted thorough experiments on the datasets collected from two specific real world content sharing websites . Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of TAA in topic specific authority identification as well as the predictive power of the TAA generative model .
The rest of this paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we describe the prior work related to ours . The problem statement is given in Section 3 . Section 4 introduces our
TAA model , for which the inference is depicted in Section 5 . In Section 6 , we present the experimental results . Finally , we conclude the paper in Section 7 .
2 . RELATED WORK
Much work has been done on authority identification based on a network structure . The two most representative studies are PageRank [ 24 ] and HITS [ 21 ] . Zhang et al . [ 32 ] tested PageRank and HITS on a specific online community for expert identification . Jurczyk and Agichtein [ 19 ] employed the HITS algorithm to discover authorities in question answer communities . Kempe et al . [ 20 ] abstracted authority analysis into a influence maximization problem and pioneered the Linear Threshold ( LT ) Model and Independent Cascade ( IC ) Model to explain the spread of influence in a social network . Along with subsequent works , such as [ 11 ] and [ 22 ] , all these methods are only after the identification of global authorities instead of authorities for specific topics . Although Barbieri et al . [ 2 ] extended the LT and IC models to be topic aware , the topics are obtained based on the network structure , while totally neglecting valuable textual content .
A few studies have been conducted to find topic level authorities in the context of structure analysis of the web graph and social networks . Given the popularity of PageRank , it is only natural to extend it for topical authority analysis . Topic Sensitive PageRank ( TSPR ) [ 16 ] was such an extension that computes per topic PageRank scores for webpages . TSPR biases the computation of PageRank by replacing the classic PageRank ’s uniform teleport vector with topicspecific ones . However , it requires an existing manually categorized topic hierarchies to derive per topic teleport vectors . In [ 28 ] , Tang et al . proposed a Topical Affinity Propagation ( TAP ) model for topic level social influence . But , similar to TSPR , TAP requires a separate preprocess to obtain a set of topics . TwitterRank [ 31 ] extended TSPR to find topic level influencers on Twitter . Instead of predefined topic hierarchies , a set of topics is first produced by typical LDA [ 8 ] on the tweets . Then TwitterRank applies a method similar to TSPR to compute the per topic influence rank . Nallapati et al . proposed Link PLSA LDA [ 23 ] on a hyperlink network to estimate the influence of blogs . These studies differ from our TAA model in that they do not exploit the valuable favorite signal to model topic specific authoritativeness . Although TwitterRank and Link PLSA LDA applied to the settings different from ours , we adapted them to the authority identification on content sharing services by building proper graph structures , and compared them with our TAA in empirical studies .
There also exist a few pieces of prior work on finding important users in various applications . Chen et al . [ 9 ] proposed a latent factor model for rating prediction , based on which reputable users are identified . Zhao et al . [ 33 ] found topic level experts on community question answering services , and recommended appropriate experts to answer new questions . In [ 7 ] , Followship LDA was proposed to identify topic specific influencers on microblogs . All these methods find important users under different contexts , with the data different from ours in nature .
In the context of recommender systems , a few topic modeling studies related to our work have been conducted . Several latent factor models were proposed for tag recommendation on social media [ 5 , 6 , 4 ] . Wang and Blei [ 29 ] developed the

The users with the highest likelihood p(q|u ) are then identified as topic specific authorities .
The LDA based authority analysis exploits the fact that a user is interested in a particular topic if he or she frequently labels photos with the tags specific to this topic . It further assumes that the more frequently a user uses the tags covering a specific topic , the more authoritative he or she should be on this topic . However , this is an arguable assumption which is not always valid . Tagging frequently on a particular topic does not automatically imply that the user is an authority on this topic . In fact , an authority does not have to tag more than the other users on the topic he or she excels in . For example , on a travel blogging service , a blogger who posts a number of articles tagged with London travel may not be an authority on blogging about traveling London , given the unknown quality of these articles . It is likely that he or she is new to blogging , in which case the articles could be at a beginner level in quality . On the other hand , an actual authority may post only a couple of blogs about London travel , but he or she can specialize in this specific topic , leading to the favorable high quality blogs . By analyzing the usage data from a real world sharing log , we observed that users’ tag frequency is actually independent of their authoritativeness .
Since the sharing log reports posting and tagging information , but we are looking for the information about the content quality of posted resources , a supplementary data source is needed . Fortunately , a favorite log available in most of the content sharing services should help to infer the content quality of resources . A favorite log consists of the records of each user ’s favorites . Figure 2 depicts a few sample records from the favorite log of a photo sharing website . Each row in the table represents a record indicating that user u added resource r ( ie , a photo ) to his or her favorites . A favorite click can be interpreted as the user ’s vote in favor of the content quality of the favorited resource . It motivates our modeling the favorite signal to infer the content quality of resources based on which topic specific authorities are identified .

Agarwal and Chen [ 1 ] proposed fLDA , which is a new matrix factorization method integrating LDA priors , to predict ratings in recommender system applications . Despite the relevance of these studies to our work , there are clear differences between them . To make recommendations , CTR utilizes scalar rating responses different from the binary favorite feedback exploited by TAA . fLDA is able to take binary responses , but it aims to predict scalar ratings of users on various items , which is different from the ultimate goal of our work .
3 . PROBLEM STATEMENT
In a nutshell , the objective of this paper is developing a statistical model that identifies the authorities on a content sharing website specific to given query topic(s ) . A topicspecific authority is defined as a user who excels in the specified topic . For example , given city lights as a query topic on a photo sharing website , the topic specific authority model is intended to retrieve a list of users who are expert in city lights shooting at night .
A content sharing website generally logs a massive number of posting and tagging records that reflect every user ’s unique interest and taste . These records constitute a sharing log that a content sharing service keeps track of . Figure 1 presents a few sample records from the sharing log of a photo sharing website . Each row in the table represents a record indicating that user u assigned tag t to resource r ( ie , a photo ) which was posted by herself . For notational convenience , let L denote the total number of unique users in the log , Mu denote the number of resources posted by user u , and Nr denote the number of tags assigned to resource r . The notations used throughout this paper are given in Table 1 . Some of the notations will be explained in later sections . A feasible solution to topic specific authority identification is adapting the classic topic model Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) [ 8 ] to historical data in the sharing log . Specifically , we employ typical LDA on the sharing data by regarding a user as a document in a corpus , a tag as a word in a document . By fitting the topic model to observational data collected from the sharing log , we infer the optimal values of parameters θ and ϕ . The probabilities θ ( ie , p(z|u ) ) give the topic distribution for each user , and the probabilities ϕ ( ie , p(t|z ) ) give the tag distribution for each topic . As a result , topic specific authorities can be derived from the distributions p(z|u ) and p(t|z ) by the standard query likelihood model , where each user is scored by the likelihood

As discussed above , users’ topical interest and topical authoritativeness have different implications . A favorite log enables us to separate the analysis of users’ topical authoritativeness from that of their topical interest . In order to jointly model the two factors , we need to construct a Bayesian model which specifies a generative process much more complex than that of typical LDA . The Bayesian model is intended to exploit both the sharing signal and the favorite signal by leveraging the two usage logs .
Problem Statement Given the usage data collected from a sharing log and a favorite log , we aim to design a stochastic process that simulates how the data is generated , based on which a generative model is developed to identify authorities specific to given query topic(s ) on a content sharing service .
4 . TOPIC SPECIFIC AUTHORITY ANAL
YSIS
Naturally , no one is an authority on every topic , which implies that each user ’s authoritative degrees should be evaluated specific to individual topics . Moreover , users’ topical authoritativenesses are different from each other . Therefore , in our proposed TAA model , we introduce a K dimensional random vector over topics to characterize topical authoritativeness . The random vector is designed to be specific to individual user u , denoted by ηηηu , meaning that each user has a unique topical authoritativeness . An entry of random vector ηηηu is a latent variable ηuz reflecting user u ’s authoritative degrees on topic z . We assume that ηηηu is generated from a K dimensional Multivariate Gaussian distribution :
ηηηu ∼ MVN(μμμ , ΣΣΣ ) ,
( 2 ) where μμμ and ΣΣΣ are the mean vector and the covariance matrix , respectively . We choose the Multivariate Gaussian distribution due to its nice invariance property as a prior distribution . As will be discussed later , Multivariate Gaussian is a conjugate prior of our likelihood function , meaning that the posterior distribution of ηηηu will also be a Multivariate Gaussian . This trick benefits inference for our TAA model by computational convenience . The values of ηηηu for each user will be learned from the usage data collected from the sharing log as well as the favorite log .
A favorite click reflects a positive feedback from the user on the content quality of the specific resource . Therefore , to represent a favorite feedback , we introduce a binary random variable specific to individual user u and individual resource r , denoted by fur . The binary variable fur takes value 1 if
Figure 3 : Graphical model for Topic specific Authority Analysis the user u favorited the particular resource r , 0 otherwise . Introducing fur helps to relate the resource r to the user u who favorited r . More precisely , user u favorites resource r ( fur=1 ) , if the topical authoritativeness of r ’s owner exhibited by the resource r matches with u ’s topical interest . For instance , a user , who is interested in photos of Yellowstone National Park , may favorite the Yellowstone photos from a photographer who is expert in taking shots for Yellowstone National Park . On the other hand , user u does not favorite resource r ( fur=0 ) , if u ’s interest and the authoritativeness of r ’s owner exhibited by the resource r fall into different sets of topics . For example , a user , who is interested in blogs about Yellowstone travel , is unlikely to favorite the low quality articles from a blogger who is new to this particular topic .
Since the topical motivate under each favorite click is hidden and unavailable directly , we need to identify the topics in which a user is interested as well as the topics on which a user is authoritative . To this end , we propose a novel generative model on the usage data for topic distillation . With the distilled topics , we specify the likelihood of a favorite feedback fur from user u on r with the logistic function by : p(fur = 1|ηηηu . , ˆzu , ˆzu.r ) = p(fur = 0|ηηηu . , ˆzu , ˆzu.r ) = 1 −

( 4 ) where u' denotes the user who posted resource r ( ie , r ’s owner ) ; ˆzu denotes the topic distribution for user u ’s interest ; ˆzu.r denotes the topic distribution for the resource r posted by user u' , and ◦ denotes the Hadamard ( elementwise ) product . The element wise product of ˆzu and ˆzu.r captures similarity between the topic distributions for the resource r and the interest of the user u who favorited r , which is parameterized by the owner u' ’s topical authoritativeness ηηηu . . If the topic distribution for user u ’s interest is similar to the one for resource r , there should be the a specific set of topics prominent in both u ’s interest and resource r . A favorite click fur = 1 then indicates that this specific
1509
Figure 4 : Generative process for Topic specific Authority Analysis set of topics are the ones that the resource r ’s owner u' is expert in , and thus should be parameterized by high authoritativeness degrees . In this way , we uncover the hidden topical motivate under each favorite click .
Figure 3 shows the graphical model for our TAA , with the notations described in Table 1 . The generative process of a user ’s tags and favorite feedback is summarized in Figure 4 . A favorite feedback is naturally associated with a tuple ( u , r ) , where r denotes a resource , and u denotes the user who favorited r . To obtain individual user u ’s interest distribution over topics , each user is viewed as a mixture of topics from which tags are drawn . More specifically , for each user u ∈ {1 , . . . , L} , we first pick a topic distribution θu from a Dirichlet prior with parameter α . Then , to generate the nth tag in the resources posted by u , a topic zun is sampled from θu , after which the tag tun is drawn from the tag distribution ϕzun for topic zun . With all the obtained topics , we compute individual user u ’s topical interest distribution ˆzu by aggregating u ’s topic assignments . On the other hand , the topic distribution ˆzu.r for individual resource r posted by user u' is obtained in a similar way , except that ˆzu.r is computed by counting u' ’s topic assignments specific to resource r only .
The topic distributions ˆzu and ˆzu.r enable the generation of favorite feedback . In particular , for each tuple ( u , r ) , the binary favorite feedback fur is sampled from a Bernoulli ) . More specifdistribution with parameter ically , we compute the likelihoods of fur = 1 and fur = 0 using Equation ( 3 ) and Equation ( 4 ) , respectively . As a result , fur ∈ {0 , 1} is drawn from a Bernoulli distribution of the two likelihoods .

The various parameters we can learn from TAA characterize the different factors that affect the model structure . For a user u , the K dimensional vector ηηηu quantifies u ’s unique authoritativeness over topics , and the value θuz gives the probability that u is interested in topic z . For a topic z , the value ϕzt indicates the probability of tag t belonging to topic z . The inferred quantities serve as the inputs to our authority analysis framework , which will be described later .

INFERENCE FOR TAA
In this section , we present how the parameters of the TAA model are inferred from the usage data collected from the sharing log and the favorite log . More specifically , we first construct a training dataset from the usage data , with which a new Bernoulli likelihood parametrized by a logistic function is specified . Finally , an extension of traditional Gibbs sampling specialized for the logistic likelihood function is proposed to infer the optimal values of the parameters .
5.1 Preference Learning
We learn the parameters of the TAA model from a training set of observations constructed from the usage data . As mentioned above , the favorite log consists of user preferences for resources in a content sharing service . One important fact about the favorite log is that only positive observations are available – each favorite click is viewed as positive feedback for the corresponding tuple ( u , r ) , ie , fur = 1 . However , there are not such clear conclusions for fur = 0 . Considering the non clicked tuples ( u , r ) ( ie , user u did not click on the favorite button for resource r . ) as negative feedback ( fur = 0 ) would misinterpret the signal of these tuples , since there are actually at least two different interpretations for any non clicked tuple . One possibility is a negative feedback , meaning that the user did not like the resource and did not want to add it to his or her favorites . Another possibility is a missing value , indicating that the user did not even see the resource , in which case whether the user favorited the resource is unknown .
On the other hand , the non clicked tuples should not be simply ignored , as typical machine learning models are not able to learn anything from the positive observations alone . To overcome the problem of missing negative feedback ( fur = 0 ) , we use tuple pairs as training data instead of individual tuples . As opposed to treating non clicked tuples as negative observations , we assume that users prefer the resources , for which they clicked on the favorite buttons , over the other non clicked resources from the same owner . More specifically , suppose that ri and rj represent two resources posted by a user . Given two tuples ( u , ri ) and ( u , rj ) , user u prefers ri over rj if and only if ri was favorited by u while rj was not , which is denoted by ri ffu rj . Formally , we create training data D by including the pairwise preference relations as follows :
D = {(u , ri , rj)|ri ffu rj} ,
( 5 ) where each preference relation o = ( u , ri , rj ) is a training sample representing the fact that user u prefers ri over rj . For the resources that are both favorited by a user , we cannot infer any preference . The same is true for two resources either of which a user did not favorite . As discussed above , we construct the observational dataset D using the induced preference relations in place of the raw favorite feedback fur . As a result , the likelihood functions ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) need to be extended to incorporate the pairwise preference . Therefore , we reformulate the likelihood of a preference relation as :

5.2 Bayesian Inference
Typical LDA like generative models employ collapsed Gibbs sampling to infer their parameters [ 15 , 17 , 26 ] . However ,

Bayesian inference for a model with the logistic likelihood function ( 6 ) has long been recognized as a hard problem , due to the analytically inconvenient form of the Gibbs sampler for a logistic likelihood [ 18 , 12 , 14 ] . In this section , we present an extension of traditional collapsed Gibbs sampling to infer the parameters in TAA . Our algorithm takes advantage of the data augmentation idea by introducing auxiliary variables to the posterior distribution . It extends the very recent work on inference for logistic models [ 25 , 10 ] to learn a Bayesian model for topic specific authority analysis . Specifically , using the ideas of introducing P´olya Gamma variables presented in [ 25 , 10 ] , we are able to derive the posterior probabilities for the Gibbs sampler analytically . Part of the derivation is provided in the appendix .
Let us first familiarize ourselves with a new family of
P´olya Gamma distributions [ 25 ] .

By definition , the posterior distribution of the auxiliary variable δurij turns out to be a P´olya Gamma distribution : where the gk ∼ Gamma(b , 1 ) are independent Gamma random variables ; the notation d= denotes equality in distribution .
The P´olya Gamma family has been carefully constructed to yield a simple Gibbs sampler for the Bayesian logistic model . Let δurij denote a P´olya Gamma variable specific to ( u , ri , rj ) . With the introduction of the auxiliary random variable δurij , the likelihood function ( 6 ) can be represented as mixtures of Gaussians with respect to a P´olya Gamma distribution , which is rewritten as : p(ri ffu rj|ηηηu . , ˆzu , ˆzu.ri , ˆzu.rj )

The above posterior univariate distributions create a Markov chain for Gibbs sampling . It has been shown that the stationary distribution of the Markov chain is just the soughtafter posterior joint distribution [ 13 ] . Specifically , the Gibbs sampler iteratively draws samples from p(ηηηx|• ) , p(zun|• ) and p(δurij|• ) using Equations ( 12 ) , ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , respectively . After the Gibbs sampler has run for an appropriate number of iterations ( until the chain has converged to a stationary distribution ) , we draw a sample ηηηx for each user x , which
1511 quantifies x ’s topical authoritativeness , and obtain the estimates for the distributions θ and ϕ via the following equations :
θuz =
ϕzt = czu + αz
K k=1 cku +
K k=1 αk gzt + βt
V t=1 gzt +
V t=1 βt

5.3 Authority Analysis Framework
With the inferred parameters , we introduce an analysis framework for topic specific authority identification . The analysis framework allows a user to issue a query q reflecting the topic(s ) on which authorities are to be identified . The query q consists of a list of tags , where multi occurrences of a tag are allowed to reflect its importance to the query topic(s ) . The analysis framework subsequently produces an ordered list of authorities by their authoritativeness degrees that satisfy the user ’s query intent .
To rank a list of authorities , the analysis framework requires ( a ) every user ’s topical authoritativeness : η , and ( b ) the topic(s ) of query q : zq . When the TAA model is used as the underlying topic specific authority analysis method , the topical authoritativeness η is produced as part of the results . To derive q ’s topic(s ) zq , we use the folding in technique on TAA by treating the query as a new user , and perform the sampling for only the tags of the pseudo user . Given the derived topical authoritativeness ηηηu and the query topic(s ) zq , Nq we obtain the final authoritativeness Ψ(u , q ) = i=1 ηuzqi for a user u with respect to the query q , where Nq denotes the number of tags in q . Finally , the users are returned in decreasing order of their authoritativeness Ψ(u , q ) .
6 . EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
In this section , we report the experimental results of the TAA model on real world data collected from two specific content sharing services : Flickr 5 and 500px 6 . We quantitatively compare the results of TAA with those of several competitors on both datasets . We also give real examples of Flickr authorities identified by TAA . Analysis and discussion of the experimental results are presented in this section .
6.1 Data Collections
Although TAA is a generic Bayesian model which is applicable to topic specific authority identification on various kinds of content sharing services , we conduct experiments on the real world datasets collected from two specific websites Flickr and 500px to evaluate the quality of identified authorities . Flickr is one of the most popular photo sharing website , which allows users to store , share , tag and organize their photos . The huge number of Flickr users calls for an topic specific authority model to identify the best photographers for a specified query topic . As opposed to Flickr ’s general user base , 500px is a photo sharing platform catered to professional photographers . A distinct feature of 500px is the Editors’ Choice page7 which shows the finest photos hand picked by the professional editors employed by 500px . These high quality photos are used to derive the ground truth for our empirical evaluation .

We collected the sharing logs and the favorite logs from both Flickr and 500px . The usage data obtained from the collected logs were processed to create training data D , on which a TAA model was built . Extra usage information was collected to derive the ground truth for both datasets , which will be described in the next subsection . The basic statistics of the Flickr dataset and the 500px dataset are given in Table 2 .
6.2 Evaluation Strategy
Quantitatively evaluating the quality of topic specific authority analysis is a difficult task , since a content sharing service generally does not explicitly specify real authorities given a topic . Luckily , the abundant information embedded in the databases of Flickr and 500px helps to derive ground truth of topic specific authorities .
Flickr has a large number of user created groups that allow people who have similar interests to get together and share their photos reflecting these interests . Each of the groups is generally dedicated to a certain topic , such as food , animals , certain photo techniques , or creative commons , etc . Every group has one or more administrators which can be viewed as the real authorities specific to the group topic . On the other hand , 500px organizes photos by category , such as wedding , underwater , concert , or transportation , etc . We rank the users for each category according to their numbers of photos get selected by the editors by category . The ranked list of users for each category is instead viewed as ground truth , since unlike a Flickr group , a 500px category has no administrators specific to the category topic .
Given the different kinds of ground truth for Flickr and 500px , we used different evaluation metrics to measure the quality of the results from compared algorithms . Let Q denote a set of queries . For each query q ∈ Q , each algorithm returns an ordered list of users by their authoritativeness . For the Flickr dataset , we employed the standard Mean Reciprocal Rank ( MRR ) . The Reciprocal Rank of a ranked list is the multiplicative inverse of the rank of the first hit in the list . The MRR score of an algorithm is the average reciprocal rank obtained by the ranked lists given by the algorithm with respect to the query set Q . Formally ,
M RR =
1|Q|
1 rankq q∈Q
( 18 ) where rankq is the rank of the first real authority in the ranked list for query q . By definition , a higher MRR score indicates a better algorithm . For the 500px dataset , on the other hand , we employed the Spearman ’s rank correlation coefficient to assess the correlation between ground truth and a ranked list of users given by each algorithm . The Spearman ’s coefficient ρq for query q can take a range of values from 1 to +1 ( ρq < 0 for a negative correlation , ρq > 0 for a positive correlation ) . The Spearman ’s coefficient ρ of an algorithm is the average Spearman ’s coefficient over the query set Q given by the algorithm . Formally ,

6.3 Quality of Authority Analysis
In our experiments , we evaluated the quality of the authorities identified by the six algorithms , Most tagged , LDA , Most favorited , TwitterRank , Link PLSA LDA , and TAA . Given a set of tags as a query , the Most tagged approach first identifies relevant photos by lexical matches against the query tags . The number of relevant photos of each user is viewed as his or her authoritativeness degree , by which Most tagged produces a ranked list of users as a final result . By contrast , LDA identifies relevant photos using probabilistic topic modeling [ 8 ] . As a result , users are ranked in descending order of the query likelihoods given by Equation ( 1 ) . Note that both Most tagged and LDA utilize observational data from the sharing log while neglecting the valuable signal from the favorite log . On the contrary , Most favorited leverages both the sharing log and the favorite log in a way that produces an ordered list of users by the numbers of times their relevant photos are favorited . As opposed to the previous three approaches , TwitterRank and Link PLSA LDA both build upon the graph structure constructed from the favorite log . Specifically , we construct the graph by creating a node for each user . There exists a link from node u to node v if the user corresponding to u favorited any photo of the user corresponding to v . A user ’s tags are associated with the corresponding node . The TwitterRank algorithm was originally proposed to find topic level key influencers on Twitter [ 31 ] . It extends typical Topic Sensitive PageRank [ 16 ] to compute per topic influence scores . This requires a separate preprocess to create topics by running LDA on the text content associated with the nodes . The transition probability between two nodes in TwitterRank is defined based on the topical similarity between the corresponding users . Given the similar nature of the Twitter network and our constructed graph , we employ the TwitterRank algorithm to find topic level authorities on a content sharing service . On the other hand , Link PLSALDA is a probabilistic topic model on a hyperlink/citation network , which jointly models text and citations to estimate the influence of blogs/publications [ 23 ] . We adapt it to our constructed graph for topic specific authority analysis . In our experiments , for every topic sensitive algorithm , we set the number of topics to 100 . We set all symmetric priors as 0.1 for every model with Dirichlet priors . For our TAA , we ran Gibbs sampling for 500 iterations . These settings are fairly typical and their tuning is beyond the scope of this paper . t i n e c i f f e o c n o i t l a e r r o c k n a r s n a m r a e p S

Figure 6 : Spearman ’s rank correlation coefficient for the 500px dataset
To compute MRRs on the Flickr dataset , we randomly selected 200 Flickr groups , whose administrators were treated as the real authorities on the respective group topics . The Top Tags generated by Flickr for each group were fed as a query to each algorithm . Figure 5 shows the MRR score of each algorithm on the Flickr dataset . It is observed that Most tagged and LDA were inferior to the other algorithms , as neither of them models the valuable favorite signal . On the contrary , by exploiting the favorite data , the algorithms Most favorited , TwitterRank , Link PLSA LDA and the proposed TAA produced higher MRR scores . In particular , TwitterRank underperformed Link PLSA LDA and TAA , due to its separation between topic modeling and authority analysis . To further measure the improvement of TAA over the runner up Link PLSA LDA , we performed a paired t test between them , which gave p value < 005 It indicated that the improvement of TAA over Link PLSA LDA was statistically significant . This is not surprising because Link PLSA LDA as well as TwitterRank fail to uncover the latent topical motivate under each favorite click . Instead , they establish a link on the graph as long as a user favorited any photo of another , disregarding the identity of the photo as well as its underlying topics .
For 500px , we plot the Spearman ’s coefficient for each algorithm in Figure 6 . From this figure , we observe the pattern similar to that of Figure 5 . TAA outperformed all the other algorithms , thanks to its unified framework of topic modeling and authority analysis . In addition , TAA benefited from its ability to identify users’ topical authoritativeness by uncovering each favorite click ’s underlying topical motivate and learning from pairwise resource preference .
6.4 Predictive Power Analysis
As generative models , our TAA , as shown in Figure 3 , and the competitor Link PLSA LDA [ 23 ] are able to generate and predict unseen new data . We evaluated the predictive power and generalizability of both models using the standard perplexity metric [ 8 ] . The perplexity is monotonically decreasing in the likelihood of the unseen test data . Hence , a lower perplexity score indicates stronger predictive power . Formally , the perplexity is defined as :
− f ∈Ftest log p(f )

Figure 8 : Perplexity for the 500px dataset where Ftest denotes the test set of favorites . For both Flickr and 500px , we held out 10 % of the data for test purposes and trained the models on the remaining 90 % .
Figure 7 and Figure 8 present the perplexity as a function of the numbers of topics for both models on Flickr data and 500px data , respectively . It is clear that the TAA consistently produced lower perplexity scores than Link PLSALDA for both Flickr and 500px , indicating that our TAA model has stronger predictive power and better generalizability . Moreover , TAA predicted unseen favorites even better as the number of topics increases .
6.5 Case Visualization
For the visualization of the TAA model , we performed searches on Flickr data for a list of photographers who are expert in two specific topics . Figure 9 shows the examples of photographers identified by TAA together with their ranks in the lists . To illustrate their expertise in photography , photos on the query topics are presented as well . For the first query topic : winter snow landscape , we see from the photos that the first user in the ranked list demonstrated the expertise in shooting snow landscape in winter . By contrast , the user in rank 100 seemed to have broader interests , not specializing in this specific topic . The last user looked even irrelevant to the query topic . For the second query topic : waterscape , the user at the top was clearly superior to the others in waterscape shooting , although some photos from the last two users were somewhat related to the water topic .
7 . CONCLUSION
Figure 9 : Examples of the ranked lists of photographers identified by TAA on Flickr data ing service . To model topic specific authoritativeness , we introduce a novel method of Topic specific Authority Analysis ( TAA ) , which properly captures the associations among users’ interest and authoritativeness as well as the topics of favorited resources to exploit the signal of favorite clicks . The parameters in the TAA model are learned from a training set of observations constructed from two data sources : sharing log and favorite log . To overcome the limitation of missing negative feedback , we propose a preference learning technique embedding a new logistic likelihood function . An extension of typical collapsed Gibbs sampling is further proposed for Bayesian inference with the logistic likelihood . With the inferred parameters , our analysis framework produces a ranked list of authorities by their authoritativeness specific to given query topic(s ) .
We conducted thorough experiments on the datasets collected from two specific real world content sharing websites , Flickr and 500px . Experimental results demonstrate that the TAA model outperforms the competitors , confirming its effectiveness in topic specific authority analysis and its generalizability to unseen data .
