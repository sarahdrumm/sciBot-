ABSTRACT In this paper we study bid optimisation for real time bidding ( RTB ) based display advertising . RTB allows advertisers to bid on a display ad impression in real time when it is being generated . It goes beyond contextual advertising by motivating the bidding focused on user data and it is different from the sponsored search auction where the bid price is associated with keywords . For the demand side , a fundamental technical challenge is to automate the bidding process based on the budget , the campaign objective and various information gathered in runtime and in history . In this paper , the programmatic bidding is cast as a functional optimisation problem . Under certain dependency assumptions , we derive simple bidding functions that can be calculated in real time ; our finding shows that the optimal bid has a non linear relationship with the impression level evaluation such as the click through rate and the conversion rate , which are estimated in real time from the impression level features . This is different from previous work that is mainly focused on a linear bidding function . Our mathematical derivation suggests that optimal bidding strategies should try to bid more impressions rather than focus on a small set of high valued impressions because according to the current RTB market data , compared to the higher evaluated impressions , the lower evaluated ones are more cost effective and the chances of winning them are relatively higher . Aside from the theoretical insights , offline experiments on a real dataset and online experiments on a production RTB system verify the effectiveness of our proposed optimal bidding strategies and the functional optimisation framework .

INTRODUCTION
Real time bidding ( RTB ) has recently emerged as a new display advertising paradigm . Unlike traditional sponsored search or contextual advertising , where an advertiser presets a bid price for each keyword chosen for their campaigns , RTB allows an advertiser to submit a bid for each individual impression ( based on the impression level features ) in a very short time frame , often less than 100ms [ 38 ] . RTB has fundamentally changed the landscape of display advertising because ( i ) allowing per impression transactions scales the buying process across a large number of available ad inventories including the leftovers ; ( ii ) real time audience data encourages behaviour ( re )targeting and makes a significant shift towards buying that is focused on user data [ 31 ] , rather than contextual data .
Demand Side Platforms ( DSPs ) are thus created to help advertisers manage their campaigns and optimise their realtime bidding activities . Figure 1 briefly illustrates the role of a DSP in the RTB eco system . In RTB display advertising , once a user visits a webpage and an ad impression is created , a bid request for the impression is immediately triggered by the publisher ( usually the Supply Side Platform , aka SSP , a technology platform to manage publishers’ inventories ) and then sent to the DSPs via an ad exchange . On behalf of an advertiser , the DSP will compute a bid for this impression and return a bid response to the exchange , where a second price auction is usually held to select the winner . Finally the winner is notified and his/her ad is displayed to the user through the publisher . A more detailed introduction to RTB is given in [ 35 , 38 ] .
More specifically , after receiving a bid request , the DSP will find all eligible ad creatives from all campaigns1 and compute a bid for each of them . The DSP uses both contextual [ 6 ] ( eg domain , webpage , keywords , time and date , geographical location , weather , language , operating system , browser , etc . ) and behavioural [ 22 ] ( eg search , browsing , and purchase history , occupation , income , sentiment , etc . ) data to compute a bid . It is common and usually encouraged that advertisers buy user interest segments from third data providers [ 31 ] . Note that although we confine our work to the Cost Per Mille ( CPM ) pricing model which is commonly adopted in RTB , other less popular models are also available ( eg Cost Per Click and Cost Per Acquisition ) .
This bid calculation ( see the bidding engine in Figure 1 ) is the most important problem for a DSP . The solution to this problem is referred to as a bidding strategy . In pure second price auctions [ 24 ] for strategic competitors , theoretically the dominant strategy for advertisers is truth telling : to bid their private values [ 15 ] . When facing a bid request , a DSP will evaluate the value of the impression ie to estimate the click through/conversion rate ( CTR/CVR ) and

( ii ) Based on the auction winning function built from the data , the derived optimal bidding function from our framework is in the concave form against the KPI of each impression , which to our knowledge has never been studied in previous literature on RTB display advertising . ( iii ) Comprehensive offline and online experiments are conducted to verify the practical effectiveness of our proposed bidding strategy .
2 . RELATED WORK
Bid optimisation is a well studied problem in online advertising [ 17 , 21 , 18 , 32 ] . Nonetheless , most research has been so far limited to keyword auction in the context of sponsored search ( SS ) [ 15 , 4 , 28 ] . Typically , under the scenario of pre setting the keyword bids ( not impression level ) , the keyword utility , cost and volume are estimated and then an optimisation process is performed to optimise the advertisers’ objectives ( KPIs ) [ 5 , 42 , 23 , 41 ] . Given a campaign budget as the cost upper bound , optimising the advertiser performance is defined as a budget optimisation problem [ 17 , 30 ] . Furthermore , the authors in [ 7 , 16 ] focus on the bid generation and optimisation on broad matched keywords , where query language features are leveraged to infer the bid price of related keywords . The authors in [ 40 ] propose to jointly optimise the keyword level bid and campaign level budget allocation under a multi campaign sponsored search account . Some recent work focuses on periodically changing the pre setting keyword auction price , taking into account the remaining budget and lifetime . For instance , in [ 3 , 20 ] , Markov decision process is used to perform online decision in tuning the keyword bid price , where the remaining auction volume and budget act as states and the bid price setting as actions . In [ 23 ] authors propose to calculate a bid allocation plan during the campaign lifetime , where the bid price on each keyword is set in different discrete time unit by considering the market competition and the CTR on different ad positions . However , none of the work evaluates per impression auction as in SS , all the bids are associated with keywords and impression level features are seldom considered , especially for advertisers and their agencies . Moreover , in SS bid optimisation , search engines play two roles : setting the keyword bids as well as hosting the auctions . The objective function could be diverted to optimise the overall revenue for the search engine [ 2 , 33 , 14 , 43 ] , rather than the performance of each individual advertiser ’s campaigns .
The bid optimisation for RTB display advertising is fundamentally different . First , the bids are not determined by pre defined keywords [ 38 ] , but are based on impression level features . Although in general advertisers ( or DSPs ) are required to set up their target rules , they need to estimate the value of each ad impression that is being auctioned in real time and return the bid price per auction . Second , in RTB , CPM pricing is generally used [ 38 ] . Winning an impression directly results in the cost , despite the fact clicks and conversions can now be directly optimised by advertisers and DSPs . Thus , the dependencies over various effectiveness measures such as eCPC2 , CPM and the budget constraints need to be studied in a single framework . In [ 18 ] the authors propose an algorithm that learns winning bids distribution from full or partial information of auctions in display advertising . The algorithm then makes bidding decisions to achieve the best delivery ( number of impressions ) within the budget constraint . In [ 10 ] , the bid price from each campaign can be adjusted by the publisher side in real time and the target is to maximise the publisher side
2Effective cost per click ( eCPC ) The cost of a campaign divided by the total number of clicks delivered .
Figure 1 : An illustration of a demand side platform and its bidding engine in RTB display advertising . multiply it by the value of a click/conversion [ 26 ] . Many advertisers simply set this value as their bid [ 32 , 26 ] and keep using it throughout a campaign ’s lifetime . However , when computing a bid , practical constraints need to be taken into account including the bid landscape ( the expected impressions against the bid price ) , total budget and the campaign ’s remaining lifetime . These considerations enable the DSP to optimise towards the overall performance of a campaign ( usually referred to as Key Performance Indicator , KPI , eg the number of clicks , conversions or total revenue ) using stochastic methods rather than assuming advertisers are strategic and have a private “ true ” value per impression [ 3 ] .
In this paper , the impression level bidding strategy is formulated as a function that maps the individual impression evaluation to the bid value . A novel functional optimisation framework is proposed to find the optimal bidding function : ( i ) given the budget constraint and the campaign ’s lifetime , and ( ii ) taking into account various statistics such as the probability of winning the auction and the prior distribution of the impression features . Our analytical solution indicates that the auction winning function plays a more critical role in shaping the bidding function , whereas the distribution of the features is less correlated . Simple winning functions derived from practical bidding data result in optimal bidding functions that are non linear and in a concave form . Unlike a linear function previously proposed [ 32 ] , our bidding function encourages to higher bids for impressions with low estimated value because compared to higher evaluated ones , those are more cost effective and the chance of winning them are relatively higher . Apart from the theoretic insights , both offline experiments on a real dataset and online experiments on a production DSP show that the proposed bidding strategies outperform the strong baselines that have been considered .
To summarise , the contributions of our work are listed below . ( i ) We propose a novel functional optimisation framework to find the optimal bidding strategy in RTB dis

The most relevant work is in [ 32 ] , where DSP returns the bid price with a linear relationship to the predicted CTR ( pCTR ) for each ad impression being auctioned . The analytical solution from our proposed functional optimisation framework shows that an optimal bidding function should be non linear . The non linearity is closely related to the probability of auction winning , but is loosely correlated with the prior distribution of the impression features .
As a new advertising paradigm , other problems in RTB have also been studied . In [ 25 ] the authors focus on the pacing problem , where the target is to smoothly deliver the campaign budget . From the SSP perspective , the reserve price setting in RTB ad auctions is studied in [ 36 ] . In [ 26 ] the sparsity problem of conversion rate estimation is handled by modelling the conversions at different selected hierarchical levels . In [ 13 ] the authors study the evaluation measures of the display advertising performance and they find the site visit turns to be a better proxy than the user click . In addition , there is some work on the ad exchange communication problem [ 9 , 29 ] . More discussion on related research of RTB can be found in [ 38 ] . 3 . OPTIMAL REAL TIME BIDDING
Each user visit of a publisher page triggers an ad auction for each ad slot on that page , which , in real time , generates a bid request for each targeting campaign . Given a bid request , along with features covering user , ad , context , and auction information , the DSP bidding engine decides whether to participate this auction , and if participates , returns a bid for this auction . The bid price depends on many factors . It is not only influenced by the predicted KPI ( pKPI ) value of the ad impression being auctioned , such as the CTR and CVR , that the advertiser wants to achieve , but most importantly , related to many other factors such as the budget constraint , the probability of auction winning , and the features and cost of this particular ad impression . In this section , we consider the problem of optimally generating real time bids as a functional optimisation problem and propose a novel optimisation framework by taking all these factors into account . We show that solving it leads to a practical bidding function . 3.1 Problem Definition
Let us first mathematically formulate the real time bidding problem . To launch a campaign in display advertising , the advertiser uploads their ad creatives , sets the targeting rules ( eg the user segmentation , time , location ) and the corresponding budget for the lifetime of the campaign .
After the target rules are set , before optimising the bid , the advertiser would first spend a small amount of budget to bid random impressions in order to learn some statistics . For instance , as studied in [ 8 , 12 ] the auction volume forecast ( eg bid landscape prediction ) module is usually employed to estimate auction statistics with respect to the current setting and budget constraint . More specifically , we denote the estimated number of bid requests for the target rules during the lifetime T as NT . Also , each bid request is represented by a high dimensional feature vector x , where its entries consist of two sets of features : one is exacted from the campaign ad itself , and the other is related to the impression being auctioned , eg , the cookie information of the underlying user , location , time , user terminal , browser , the contextual information about the webpage , etc . We use px(x ) to denote the prior distribution of the feature vectors which match the campaign target rules . For each campaign , the advertiser can use the historic bidding and feedback data to predict the KPI for the ad impression being auctioned . We denote the predicted KPI of a bid request x as ( x ) . Note that different advertisers might consider different KPIs . For example , if the goal of a campaign is to maximise the direct visits , ie the total number of clicks , then ( x ) denotes the pCTR for that impression . For CTR estimation , we refer to [ 19 , 34 ] . If the goal of a campaign is for conversions , then ( x ) denotes the predicted CVR ( pCVR ) for that impression . We also denote p( ) as the prior distribution of the predicted KPI per bid request . The notation descriptions are given in Table 1 .
Once the major statistics are gathered , our problem now is to devise an optimal bidding strategy such that a certain KPI objective over the budget will be maximised . For the sake of clarity , we consider the number of clicks as the objective here , while a natural extension to covering alternative KPIs and their experimental results are given later in Section 55 Mathematically , our optimal bid generation problem is formulated as a functional optimisation problem :
∫ ∫ b()ORTB = arg max
NT b( ) subject to NT
( x)w(b((x ) ; x ) ; x)px(x)dx b((x ) ; x)w(b((x ) ; x ) ; x)px(x)dx ≤ B :
( 1 ) x x where b((x ) ; x ) denotes the bidding function we intend to obtain . It depends on the feature vector x and the estimated CTR ( x ) . w(b ; x ) denotes the estimated winning rate for a bid price b given the feature x of the impression auction . In Eq ( 1 ) , the product of ( x ) and w(b ; x ) produces the probability of click given an impression auction . Marginalising it over the feature space yields the expected click per impression auction . Note that in practice , the impression auctions arrive sequentially , so one can potentially make a sequential bidding rule by taking a feedback loop and employing a dynamical optimisation model such as partially observable Markov decision processes ( POMDPs ) [ 37 ] . However , generally these models are computationally expensive thus not feasible in our case , where bid decisions usually need to be returned within 100ms . We , thus , take a two stage approach ( learning statistics such as px(x ) and NT , then optimising the bids ) . Without loss of generality , we consider a simple static model and follow a widely accepted assumption in the previous bid optimisation work [ 20 , 10 ] : each time the feature vector is independently generated from an identical distribution .
The constraint is made by an upper bound of the expected cost . RTB normally applies the second price auction ( pay the second highest bid ) . However , due to the reserve price setting , the cost is quite often higher than the second highest bid [ 36 , 38 ] . We thus use the bid price b((x ) ; x ) as the upper bound of the cost of winning . Specifically , the
1079 product of the cost and the winning rate produces the expected cost per impression auction . Marginalising it over the feature space and multiplying by NT yields the expected cost , which is set to be not greater than the budget B . Note that by maximising the click number with the budget constraint , the eCPC is minimised , which is a much important measure in display advertising .
To make the above problem solvable , we consider sequential dependency among the variables for each auction by making the following assumptions :
• Assume b((x ) ; x ) ≡ b((x) ) . That is : x → → b . This allows us to largely reduce the functional decision space for the optimisation , while still gaining the dependency of the impression features through the KPI estimation ( x ) . The previous work in [ 32 ] also adopts a similar dependency ( bid only depends on CTR ) .
• Assume w(b ; x ) ≡ w(b ) . That makes the feature x only influence the winning rate via its generated bid : x → → b → w . The assumption as sensible as we found out ( shown in Section 4.1 ) that the dependency over the bid request features is far less than the bid price . Previous SS bid optimisation work [ 23 , 40 ] also makes such assumption on winning keyword ad slots .
Then the optimisation problem is rewritten as b()ORTB = arg max
NT b( ) subject to NT
( x)w(b((x)))px(x)dx b((x))w(b((x)))px(x)dx ≤ B :
( 2 ) x x
Furthermore , since there is a deterministic relationship between x and ( x ) , the relationship between their probability density is also determined :
∫ ∫ p((x ) ) = px(x ) ||∇(x)|| :
( 3 )
Thus we can focus on via performing integration by substitution
∫ ∫ ∫ ∫
( x)w(b((x)))px(x)dx ( x)w(b((x)))p((x))||∇(x)||dx x x
( x)w(b((x)))p((x))d(x )

( x )
= w(b())p()d and the similar substitution for Rewriting the integration with respect to leads to our final functional optimisation problem as follows : x b((x))w(b((x)))px(x)dx . b()ORTB = arg max

; where we can see the KPI probability density p( ) has been eliminated and the form of bidding function b( ) only depends on the winning function w(b())3 . This is mainly because both the objective and constraint take the integration over the distribution of p( ) . Different winning functions result in different optimal bidding functions . Here we present two winning functions which are typical and fit the curves of real world data . And we derive the optimal bidding function form for each winning function . 321 Winning & Bidding Function 1 As depicted in Figure 5 from our experiment on a real data4 , the winning rate w(b ) consistently has an ( approximately ) concave shape : when the bid price is low , adding a unit bid will increase the winning rate more than when the bid is already high . Thus a simple winning function is in the form of w(b( ) ) = b( ) c + b( )

( 9 ) where c is a constant . An illustration of the winning function with different c ’s is given in Figure 2(a ) .

Under the assumption of the winning function 1 in the form of Eq ( 9 ) , the optimal bidding function bORTB1( ) is in a concave form : a square root function form . Figure 2(b ) gives an illustration of this bidding function with different parameter c ’s , fixing = 5:2 × 10 322 Winning & Bidding Function 2 For some campaigns with competitive targets , or the targeted publishers/SSPs setting a high reserve price , the winning probability will not increase rapidly when the bid price is around 0 ; only after the bid price becomes larger than some non zero value the winning probability starts to dramatically increase . Such case usually occurs in high profile ad slots [ 40 ] . To get this feature , we slightly alter it and propose an alternative of winning function : w(b( ) ) = b2( ) c2 + b2( )

( 14 ) where the parameter c controls the increasing point of the curve5 . An illustration is given in Figure 3(a ) .

Our optimisation framework is a general one : Eq ( 8 ) shows that different winning functions would lead to different optimal bidding functions . The framework can adapt to various ad markets with different winning functions . Here we estimate the winning functions from real data ( Figure 5 ) and limit our study to the RTB markets only . 323 Discussions on Resulting Bidding Functions Unlike the linear form bidding function in the previous study [ 32 , 26 ] ( denoted as Lin ) , our derived bidding functions ( denoted as ORTB ) Eq ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) suggest a nonlinear concave form mapping from CTR estimation to the bid value under a budget constraint for RTB . As shown in Figure 4 , compared with Lin , ORTB bids higher when the estimated KPI is low , which means ORTB allocates more budget on the low reward and low cost cases .
The strategy of bidding more low cost impressions comes from the shape of the winning functions . In Figure 5 we find that for all the campaigns , when we increase the bid
5Actually we can take a more general form of the winning function : w(b( ) ) = bff()=(cff + bff() ) . We investigate the case of ff = 1 ; 2 in this paper . When ff is larger than 2 , there is no analytic solution of bORTB( ) .
Figure 4 : Concave bidding function bids higher on the cases with pCTR less than 0.0011 ( example ) and vice versa , which allocates more budget on the cases with low bid price and thus low cost . price from zero , the winning probability will have a high growth rate first and after the bid price surpasses a region , the winning probability starts to converge to 1 . As such , the strategy of ORTB will earn much more winning probability while only increase a little CPM because of the concavity of winning rate respective to the bid price . 324 Optimal Solution of The bidding functions in Eq ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) also take as the parameter ; let us explicitly denote them as b( ; ) . To calculate the optimal , the Euler Lagrange condition of from Eq ( 6 ) is∫ b( ; )w(b( ; ))p()d =

Given the formula of b( ; ) , the solution can be found . However , in many cases such as using our winning functions , there is no analytic solution of . Also we can see the solution depends on p( ) . Alternatively , one can find the numeric solution using the bidding log data and practically solve it using efficient numeric calculation . In this paper , we take a rather pragmatic approach by regarding as a tuning parameter for the bidding functions and learn it from the data . From Eq ( 13 ) , ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) , it is easy to see that b( ; )w(b( ; ))p()d when decreases the value of monotonically increases . Therefore , with larger per case budget B=NT , the solution of becomes smaller , which corresponds to a higher bid price . Our experiment will demonstrate the trend of optimal corresponding to different per case budget B=NT ( Figure 11 and 12 ) .

Our methods are tested both by offline evaluation ( Section 5 ) using a real world dataset and via online evaluation ( Section 6 ) over a commercial DSP with real advertisers and impressions . In this section , we introduce the experiment setup and report the results from our data analysis . 4.1 Dataset and Analysis
Dataset description . We use the real world bidding feedback log from a well known DSP company as our dataset6 . It records more than 15 million impressions and the user feedback of 9 campaigns from different advertisers during ten days in 2013 . For each bid request , the log contains the information from the user ( eg the user segmentation ) , advertiser ( eg the creative format and size ) , publisher ( eg 6The dataset has been publicly released on our website : http://datacomputational advertisingorg

Figure 6 : Winning bid distribution against different features for campaign 1 . 4.2 Evaluation Measure
The task of DSPs is to optimise each campaign ’s KPI ( such as clicks , conversions etc . ) given the budget . Therefore , the KPI is the primary evaluation measure in our experiment . Specifically , we have considered clicks as our primary KPI , while other statistics such as CPM , and eCPC are also monitored . In addition , we also test on an alternative KPI which is the combination of achieved clicks and conversions , as will be discussed in Section 55
4.3 KPI Estimator Training
For each campaign , we use its impression/click/conversion log data to train a KPI estimator for each bid request . Particularly , if the KPI is click , then this task turns to be the well known CTR estimation [ 19 , 34 ] . Regression models such as random forest and gradient boosting regression tree can be applied here . Since this work mainly focuses on the bidding strategy instead of the KPI estimator model , we apply the Logistic regression as our CTR estimator as it is a widely used choice [ 34 ] . The loss is the cross entropy between the predicted click probability and the ground truth result . In addition , L2 regularisation is used . For an alternative KPI in our experiment , the KPI estimator training will be discussed in Section 55
Features are extracted from the log data to train the CTR estimator model . Specifically , we extract 29,408 firstorder binary features and based on that generate 657,756 second order binary features , which yields the total 687,164 features for our training .
4.4 Test Evaluation Setup
Evaluation flow . The evaluation flow is depicted in Figure 7 . Given the bidding strategy and a budget for the test period for a particular campaign , we can go through its test data . The test data is a list of records . Each record consists of the features of one bid request , the auction winning price and the user feedback information . Specifically , receiving the bid request features of each record by the timestamp , the bidding strategy generates a bid price for it ( if the cost is beyond the budget , just returns 0 , ie skips the remaining bid requests ) . If the bid price is higher than the auction winning price of this record , the campaign wins the auction , gets its ad shown . The corresponding user feedback ( click ) and the corresponding charged price of the record are then referenced to update the performance and cost . After that ,

For each bid request , there is an auction winning bid price , and the user feedback ( click , conversion ) is recorded if the advertiser won the auction . More details of the dataset is shown in Table 2 .
Data analysis on winning bids . Figure 5 depicts the winning rate with respect to the bid price for campaigns 1 6 ( due to space limit , campaigns 7 9 are not shown ) . We observe that all the campaigns follow a similar pattern : as the bid price increases , the campaign winning rate increases dramatically ; when the bid price gets larger ( eg more than 100 ) , the increasing of winning rate slows down and finally the winning rate converges to 1 . Thus , it is reasonable to employ concave functions like Eq ( 9 ) and ( 14 ) to model the relationships . For each campaign , we fit the winning functions with the parameter c leading the least square error with the real curve .
Next , we study the dependency between the bid request features and the winning bid prices ( also named as market prices in [ 3] ) . Figure 6 gives the box plot [ 27 ] of winning price distribution against the features such as hour , weekday , user browser , operation system and location regions of bid requests to campaign 1 ( other campaigns follow the similar pattern ) . Compared with the clear changing relationship with the bid price shown in Figure 5 , Figure 6 shows that the winning price distributions do not have obvious dependency on the categorical feature value . It suggests that the bid price is the key factor influencing the campaign ’s winning rate in its auctions . Once we have known the bid value , the winning rate is less sensitive to the other bid request features . Thus it is practically reasonable to simplify w(b ; x ) ≡ w(b ) as proposed in Section 31
Training/test split . For each campaign , we perform a 2:1 train/test data split by the time sequence . The training data is mainly used to train the CTR estimator and tune the bidding function parameters . The test data is used to evaluate the compared DSP bidding strategies .

Figure 7 : Evaluation flow chart . if there is no more bid requests in the test data , then the evaluation is over , with the final performance returned .
It is worth mentioning that using user feedback logs for evaluation has limitation . In our case , user feedback only occurs for the winning auctions ( having ad impressions ) ; there is no user feedback for the losing bids . We thus do not know whether the user will click or convert even if we bid enough high to win the originally losing ad auction in our offline experiment . In this paper , we follow the convention of the offline evaluations from sponsored search [ 19 ] , recommender systems [ 39 ] and Web search [ 11 ] that the objects ( auctions ) with unseen user feedback are ignored ( ie , considered as auction failure cases ) . To complement with the offline evaluation , we will further show the online test performance on a production DSP in Section 6 .
Budget constraints .
It is easy to see that if we set the budget the same as the original total cost in the test log , then just simply bidding as high as possible for each case will exactly run out the budget and get all the logged clicks . In our work , to test the performance against various budget constraints , for each campaign , we respectively run the evaluation test using 1/64 , 1/32 , 1/16 , 1/8 , 1/4 and 1/2 of the original total cost in the test log as the budget . 4.5 Compared DSP Bidding Strategies
We compare the following baseline and state of the art bidding strategies in our experiment . The parameters of each bidding strategy are tuned using the training data . Constant bidding ( Const ) . Bid a constant value for all the bid requests to the campaign . The parameter is the specific constant bid price . Random bidding ( Rand ) . Randomly choose a bid value in a given range . The parameter is the upper bound of the random bidding range . Bidding below max eCPC ( Mcpc ) . As discussed in [ 26 ] , given the advertiser ’s goal on max eCPC , which is the upper bound of cost per click , the bid price on an impression is obtained by multiplying max eCPC and pCTR . Here we calculate the max eCPC for each campaign by dividing its cost and achieved number of clicks in the training data . No parameter for this bidding strategy . Linear form bidding of pCTR ( Lin ) . In the previous work [ 32 ] , the bid value is linearly proportional to the pCTR . The formula can be generally written as bLin( ) = b0
0
;
( 17 ) where 0 is the average CTR under a target condition ( eg , a user inventory pair ) and b0 is the basic bid price for this target condition . We tune b0 in our experiment . Optimal real time bidding ( ORTB1 and ORTB2 ) . These are our derived optimal bidding strategies in our

Table 3 summarises the attributes of the different strategies . Mcpc is not budget aware to make sure it spends all the budget . Mcpc , Lin and ORTB perform bidding based on impression level evaluation . Taking winning functions into account , ORTB is the most informative strategy . In Section 5 we will analyse the impact of these attributes in the final performance .
5 . OFFLINE EVALUATION
In the experiment , we answer the following questions . ( i ) Does our derived non linear bidding function outperform the state of the art linear one ? ( ii ) What are the characteristics of our ORTB algorithms and how do the parameters impact the performance and what are their relationships with the budget conditions ? 5.1 Performance Comparison
The performance comparison on total clicks and eCPC under different budget conditions are reported in Figure 8 . We observe that ( i ) under every budget condition , our proposed bidding strategies ORTB1 and ORTB2 have the best performance on total clicks , which verifies the effectiveness of the derived non linear forms of the bidding function . ( ii ) Except ORTB , Lin is the best algorithm in the comparison . This algorithm represents the widely used DSP bidding strategies in product [ 32 ] . ( iii ) Mcpc is aware of the upper bound cost for each bid request , and dynamically changes its bid according to the estimated CTR . However , compared to ORTB and Lin , Mcpc has no adaptibility to different budget conditions . For example , when the budget is relatively low for the bid request volume , Mcpc will still bid based on the originally set max eCPC , while ORTB and Lin can adaptively lower the bid to earn the impressions and clicks with higher RIO . ( iv ) Rand and Const provide very low performance even though their parameters are tuned under different budget conditions . ( v ) Also from the eCPC performance we can see Rand and Const spend much more money to get one click than the case value aware strategy Mcpc , Lin and ORTB . The last two points suggest the benefit of real time bidding based display advertising : evaluating the

Figure 9 : Overall click improvement of ORTB1 over Lin under different budget conditions . value for each bid request ( impression level ) plays a significant role in the performance .
Table 4 gives detailed performance improvement on total clicks of ORTB1 over Lin under different campaigns and budget conditions . Among the listed 54 settings , ORTB1 wins Lin in 49 ( 90.7 % ) settings , ties in 2 ( 3.7 % ) settings , and lose in 3 ( 5.6 % ) settings . This shows ORTB1 is fairly robust and the outperformance is stable . 5.2 The Impact of Budget Constraints
It is of great interest to investigate how the bid strategy adapts the changing of the budget constraints . In our experiment , we set the test budget as 1/64 , 1/32 , 1/16 , 1/8 , 1/4 and 1/2 of the original total cost in the history log respectively . Figure 9 depicts the percentage improvement on total clicks of ORTB1 over Lin with respect to the budget constraints . As we can see , ( i ) when the budget is quite low ( eg 1/64 of the original total cost ) , the click improvement of ORTB1 over Lin is quite high ( more than 45% ) . This indicates that our proposed bidding strategy performs particularly well under very limited budget conditions . Intuitively , when the budget is quite low ( budget on per bid request B=NT is low ) , a good bidding strategy should spend relatively low on each bid request . Compared with the linear Lin , ORTB1 allocates more budget on the low cost cases due to the concave form of the bidding function ( see Figure 2(b) ) . This is sensible because from the winning rate functions in Figure 5 we know that lowering the high bid actually does not drop the winning probability too much . By contrast , highering the low bid a little will increase the winning probability a lot . ( ii ) When the test budget gets higher , the improvement percentage gets lower . This is reasonable : when there is more budget per bid request , the strategy will appropriately reallocate budget from the low cost cases to high cost cases because the high cost cases also mean high value ( CTR ) . Thus the concave degree of the curve in Figure 2(b ) will be lower . The curve will relatively approximate to ( but not fully change to ) the linear form . An extreme case is that when the test budget is set the same as the original total cost in the test log , the improvement is zero . This is because under such condition
( a )
( b )
( c )
( d )
Figure 10 : Performance on different measures with different budget conditions . for every bidding strategy ( except Mcpc ) , just bidding as high as possible will exactly run out the budget and get every impression and click in the test log . 5.3 Clicks vs . Impressions
Figure 10(a ) and 10(b ) show the total clicks and eCPC of each bidding strategy . We observe that both click number and eCPC increase as the budget increases . This is reasonable because when the budget is low , the optimal setting for each bidding strategy will push the budget to the low cost cases , while the budget is higher , the left budget will be allocated on the relative expensive cases ( but with lower ROI ) , which will higher the eCPC . Mcpc is unaware of the budget condition , and its slight eCPC fluctuation purely depends on the data . Another point is that when the budget is set very low ( 1/64 , 1/32 , 1/16 of the original spend ) , the eCPC of Lin and ORTB is lower than Mcpc , and when the budget increases over 1/4 of the original spend , the eCPC of Lin and ORTB starts to be higher than Mcpc .
Figure 10(c ) and 10(d ) plot the total impressions and CPM of each bidding strategy . We see that while our ORTB strategies generate the highest clicks , they also produce comparable numbers of impressions against the others . This certainly benefits advertisers who aim to maximising their traffic ( clicks ) while still want to maintain a good exposure ( impressions ) . 5.4 Parameter Tuning
As explained previously , although parameter can be directly solved numerically , for efficiency , in our experiment , we tune it for each campaign using the training data . Figure 11 and 12 shows the corresponding ORTB1 and ORTB2 click performance for the campaign 17 when tuning its parameter . For each , we also try different value of the other parameter c , which makes multiple points to each xvalue for volatility checking . However , practically we direct learn c to best fit the winning rate data for each campaign . From Figure 11 and 12 we see that when the given budget is low , the optimal value of is high . This is much reasonable . From Eq ( 13 ) and ( 15 ) we can see the parameter controls the general scale of the bidding price : when is higher , the bid price gets lower . Thus it is understandable that when the budget is more limited , the general bidding price level
7The trends on other campaigns are quite similar .

As discussed in Section 3.1 , our framework is flexible to incorporate different KPIs as our optimisation target . Apart from the number of clicks as the main objective studied in this paper , we also test an alternative KPI as the target by considering conversions , namely , a linear combination of the click number and conversion number , with the parameter k controlling the importance of conversion : KPI = #click + k · #conversion :
( 18 )
This objective is practically useful [ 1 ] since the conversion is a quite important measure for advertisers [ 32 ] , and such linear combination can address the sparsity problem of conversion counting [ 26 ] . In our dataset , only campaign 2 and 8 have sufficient conversion records . Thus we choose them as our optimising campaigns and we set k = 5 in our experiment . Specifically , we use two logistic regression models to learn and predict the CTR and CVR ( pCTR and pCVR ) for each bid request and the pKPI can be calculated by pKPI = pCTR + k · pCVR , which is the value of in the bidding function .
Figure 13 gives the overall KPI performance and the specific clicks/conversions obtained by each bidding strategy8 . From the results we see our ORTB strategies still outperform other compared bidding strategies , which verifies the effectiveness of ORTB on the alternative KPI optimisation . Particularly , on 1/64 budget condition , ORTB2 achieves higher KPI and conversion numbers than ORTB1 , this is mainly because the winning function 2 fits these two optimised campaigns better than winning function 1 . 8Here Mcpc is renamed as Mcpi ( ie bidding under max cost per unit of KPI ) .

Figure 14 : Relative performance for online test . 6 . ONLINE EVALUATION
With the strategy of emphasising more on lower CPM impressions than the linear strategy , we conduct an online experiment on iPinYou Optimus platform , which is currently the largest DSP in China . We test on three campaigns during consecutive three days in December 2013 . Another two compared bidding strategies are : ( i ) White list ( White ) , which keeps a list of feature rules and bids much high only when the case satisfies any of the white list rules ; ( ii ) Lin as we discussed before . The target KPI in the optimisation is click . Compared with Lin , White acts like the strategy with a step function in [ 32 ] . For each bid request , each of the three algorithms has the equal possibility to perform the bidding of iPinYou DSP . The performance comparison with various measures was reported in Figure 14 . Due to the data sensitivity , we follow [ 40 ] to only present the relative performance here .
From the comparison we can have following observations . ( i ) ORTB bids much more cases than the other two algorithms ( bids lower than the auction reserve price are not counted ) , and gets the most impressions , clicks and conversions . Also ORTB achieves the lowest eCPC , which indi

( ii ) ORTB obtains the lowest CPM . These two points show ORTB allocates more budget to the cheap cases . As a result , ORTB bids more cases with lower CPM . ( iii ) Because of the low CPM on low pCTR cases , ORTB has the lowest auction winning rate and CTR , but this is not that important since our target is the total click number . ( iv ) White acts oppositely to ORTB . It only bids high on a subset of cases , which results in its low bidding number and high CPM . Due to the carefully made white list , the cases matching the white list do have high CTR . ( v ) Lin mostly plays moderately , which is in our expectation . In sum , the online test supports our proposed bidding strategies which allocate more budget on the cheap cases to perform more bids with lower CPM .
7 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper , we proposed a novel functional optimisation framework to find the optimal real time bidding strategy for display advertising . The derived optimal bidding functions are non linear and concave with respect to predicted KPI , which to our knowledge has not been studied in the previous literature about real time bidding strategies . In our experiments , we compared our bidding strategies with other baselines and state of the art bidding strategies under different budget and KPI settings . Apart from the theoretical soundness , the offline and online experiments show that our proposed optimal bidding strategies are also practically the most effective .
In the future work , we plan to further investigate on the bidding function which directly covers the bid request features , not the KPI alone . We also intend to extend our optimisation framework to cover the following three scenarios : ( i ) As DSPs or ad agencies , how to optimise the overall performance over several advertisers they are managing ? Combining auction theory [ 24 ] with our functional optimisation framework would possibly provide a sound solution . ( ii ) Dynamic approaches [ 3 ] which tune the bid according to the specific current performance will be considered in our framework . ( iii ) Modelling the uncertainty and the risk of the bidding . The uncertainty in the CTR prediction , bidding and auction process should be carefully studied to build risk aware bidding strategies . 8 . REFERENCES
