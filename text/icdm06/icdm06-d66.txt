ABSTRACT an role e mail important interaction plays server , which observes
Interpersonal in organizational dynamics , and understanding these interaction networks is key for any organization , since they can be tapped to facilitate various organizational processes . The principal roadblock to studying organizational networks , however , has been the difficulty in collecting data about them . The approach of conducting surveys/interviews is fraught with issues of scalability , logistics , and reporting bias – especially since a survey of this nature can seem quite intrusive . Widespread use of computer networks for organizational communication provides a unique opportunity to eliminate all these difficulties and automatically map the organizational network to a high degree of accuracy and detail . This paper describes an approach to automatically build organizational networks by tapping into the all organizational communication . Specifically , our approach focuses on studying how communication between actors is perceived by other actors in a social network . Such type of networks are formally referred to as socio cognitive networks ( ie a "who knows , who knows who" network ) . The key issues addressed by this paper are the representation and construction of a socio cognitive network from electronic communication data as well as identifying and proposing techniques analyses of such networks . Each actor in the socio cognitive network has a "set of beliefs" about the communication between other actors in the network . We propose a model for representing and constructing the sociocognitive network , where communication between actors is represented as probability distributions . Each actor attempts to estimate these distributions using Bayesian inference , based only on the communication he/she observes . The conflict in beliefs between different actors , and their divergence from reality , is analyzed by comparing the belief models of actors . Measures which quantify the notions of "misperception" ( divergence of an actor ’s beliefs from reality ) , "agreement" ( similarity in beliefs of different actors ) and "consensus" ( general agreement in a group of actors ) are introduced . We present results for these on the
Enron email corpus . Our work , in addition to providing novel computational schemes to sociologists , also highlights an important aspect of social network analysis research where one focuses on how actors' perceptions evolve over time .

1 . INTRODUCTION Organization dynamics plays an the functioning of an enterprise . Understanding the dynamics of organizational processes empower managers and enable them to effectively manage an enterprise's resources . Informal social and socio cognitive networks in an organization play an important role in such processes and significant effort has been made to study such organizational networks . However , most research has relied on data collected manually ( usually using surveys and observing communications between individuals in meetings ) and hence are subject to a variety of noise ( eg biased opinions ) . The emergence of computer networks has enabled new ways of communication , eg e mail and instant messaging , between individuals in an organization , leading to new social networks being established . In addition to enabling geographicallyunrestricted communication between individuals , computer networks also enable collection of gigabytes of unbiased data about communication between individuals . This provides an unprecedented opportunity to study organizational social networks , and new computational techniques are required to do so .
In this research , we study socio cognitive networks based on email communication in an organization . Socio cognitive network analysis involves understanding who knows who knows who in a social network ( see Figure 1 ) . In case of email communication , an actor observes only those emails which are addressed to him/her ( ie the actor is on the To , Cc or Bcc fields

2 . BACKGROUND Social network analysis has been an active field of study in sociology as well as anthropology . A social network is a social structure of people called actors , related ( directly or indirectly ) to each other through a common relation of interest [ 10 ] . A social network plays an important role in the dissemination of ideas , information or influences among the group . However , in any social network , it is not possible for everyone to be connected to everyone else , nor is it desirable [ 2 ] . Thus , the main motive of social network analysis is to study “ who knows who ” in a social network . There are two types of analyses of social networks : ( i ) Socio centric ( whole ) network analysis , where the interactions between the entire well defined set of people are studied ; and ( ii ) Egocentric ( personal ) network analysis , where one studies the interactions between an actor ( called “ ego ” ) and only those actors related ( directly or indirectly ) to the ego .
Substantial research has illustrated the importance of such analyses in organizations . In an organization , informal networks are formed by relationships between employees across functions and/or divisions in order to accomplish tasks quickly [ 5 ] . Such informal networks can cut through formal reporting procedures to jump start stalled initiatives and meet extraordinary deadlines . Informal networks can just as easily sabotage companies' best laid plans by blocking communication and fomenting opposition to change unless managers know how to identify and direct them . Social network analysis enables the understanding of which actors are perceived as "friends" or "adversaries" by others , and which actors are aware of the presence of which other actors .
Taking this a step further is socio cognitive network analysis , which analyzes “ who knows who knows who ” in the social network . This analysis is useful as it affects the perceptions of an actor about other actors , and hence the behavior of actors towards other actors , which is of prime importance in an organization . The beliefs for each actor are translated into a weighted digraph corresponding to the social network that exists from that actor's perspective . Using these digraphs , one can determine who thinks who is influential in the organization . This
Figure 1 . Illustration of a Socio cognitive network the following : B and C know of those emails ) . For example , consider an e mail sent by actor A to B , with Cc to C and Bcc to D . The analysis of the header reveals that A and B communicated , and that all three of them know about this communication . However , neither B nor C knows that D was also sent this e mail . A and D know everything , and both of them also know that B and C do not know of D's getting the email . This analysis illustrates that a single e mail can create different beliefs among different people , depending on whether and how they are included in it . Based on the observed emails , an actor forms his/her beliefs about communication probabilities between different actors . An email communication network can be defined using the nodes and edges between actors representing email communication between them . Thus , the communication probabilities form the weights for the edges . Modeling of such a communication network is useful for analysis of such networks , and hence we propose a model using probability distributions for communication probabilities . A Bayesian inference technique is used for updating the probabilities in the model . For our analysis , a closed world assumption is made , ie actors’ beliefs about probabilities in a communication network are based only on the emails exchanged , and no other interaction occurs outside of the email network . the actors as
A characteristic of modeling email communication probabilities between actors is their subjective nature , since actors observe only the set of emails entering their respective mailboxes . Thus , there can be differences in perceptions about communications for different actors . We propose a new metric , a closeness , for measuring the agreement in the perceptions of two actors . The modeling of communication network separately for each actor is egocentric socio cognitive analysis , since the communication is studied from the actor's ( called ego ) perspective . On the other hand , an email server observes all communication between actors and thus can model the actual communication between all actors . This the socio centric socio cognitive network analysis . The discrepancy between the egocentric and sociocentric socio cognitive network analysis provides a measure of the discrepancy between an actor's belief and the reality . A novel measure r closeness is proposed for measuring such discrepancies . Application of the proposed model and belief divergence analysis to Enron email corpus is illustrated . is
The main contributions of this paper are : information is highly valuable for a manager to understand the existing informal network in the organization . probability that a given email in the network is from actor Ak . Thus ,
One of the main reasons for computer networks ( and Internet ) to come into existence was to foster collaborative work between geographically dispersed researchers . These computer networks have now turned into an infrastructure that supports social networks ; connecting people , organizations as well as knowledge [ 9 ] . The widespread use of internet and the growing online community of users have enabled the formation of social networks based on different relations of interest . For example , Usenet – a widely used online newsgroup – had more than 80,000 topic oriented discussion groups ( or social networks ) in 2000 . These discussion groups allow individuals to form geographically dispersed , loosely bound , social networks . On the other hand , computer networks also facilitate an actor to participate in different social networks ( communities ) . Thus enabling the actor to know many more other actors and increase his/her social capital . In an organization , it is possible to map the online actor ( eg email address ) to a real world actor ( eg employee ) , and analysis of these interactions has the potential of providing unbiased measures about social relationships between real world actors . logs all
An email server the email exchanged between employees in an organization . Thus , it gets an unbiased view of all communication occurring between employees . Analysis of such email logs will provide an insight into the computer network based ( in this case , email based ) social networks . However , to analyze such gigabytes of data about emails exchanged between employees ( considering a medium scale organization ) asks for new computational techniques . With the availability of the Enron email corpus , there has been a growing interest in applying computational techniques to analyze e mailbased social networks . Initial research on analysis of such email data has concentrated on applying traditional social network techniques and/or graph based measures [ 3 , 6 and 8 ] . In this research , we further by providing novel computational techniques for socio cognitive analysis of email data . take a step
3 . CONSTRUCTING A SOCIOCOGNITIVE NETWORK
This section presents a novel approach for automatic construction of a socio cognitive network from the analysis of an organization ’s email communication .
3.1 Basic concepts Each actor participating in the communication network , has his/her view of ( a certain portion of ) the entire network . Over a period of time , the actor develops certain beliefs regarding the communications in the social network around self , ie beliefs regarding who communicates with whom , based on what he/she has observed so far . Thus , in this framework , a socio cognitive network is the set of such beliefs for every actor in the social network .
Consider an email communication network consisting of N actors denoted by the set , {Ak | 1 ≤ k ≤ N} . Let Pk denote the k = P
Number of emails sent

Aby k the in network
Let Py|x denote the probability of Ay being a recipient of an email , given that Ax has sent that email . Thus ,

Thus , P(x,y ) is probability that actor Ax sends an email to actor Ay . P(x,y ) the actor Ax ’s communication with actor Ay . Note that each email has a unique ( single ) sender , and thus events corresponding to an email being sent by different actors are mutually exclusive . Hence , the following condition must always hold

The events corresponding to different actors being recipients of an email are not mutually exclusive as it is possible for an email to have multiple recipients . This leads P(x,y ) , ie “ an actor Ax being a sender and another actor Ay being a recipient ” , not being mutually exclusive for all pairs of actors . For example an email can be an instance of the event ‘from sender Ax to recipient Az’ as well as ‘from sender Ax to recipient Ay’ . But , since each email has one sender and at least one recipient , the following condition must always hold

Note the event of some actor Ax being the sender and Ay being a recipient is mutually exclusive to its complement , ie the event where either Ax is not the sender or Ay is not a recipient or both . The probabilities of these two events are P(x,y ) and 1 P(x,y ) respectively .
3.2 Socio cognitive Network Modeling for ie parameter
We define a Bernoulli distribution over these two events , L(x,y ) = [ P(x,y),1 P(x,y) ] . P(x,y ) is the the Bernoulli distribution L(x,y ) . There will N(N 1 ) such distributions , one for every ordered pair of actors ( Ax,Ay ) where Ax ≠ Ay . Thus , the communication between represented by actors is distributions , Bernoulli where email every
Figure 2 . Communication between actors expressed as Bernoulli distributions exchanged in the network is a Bernoulli trial , ie either a given email is “ from a given actor with another given actor being a recipient ” or it is not ( see figure 2 ) . all on his/her Based observations , every actor a distribution maintains over possible probabilities P(x,y ) for a given ordered pair ( Ax,Ay ) , ie a distribution over all possible values for the parameter of the Bernoulli distribution L(x,y ) . Since there are N(N 1 ) ordered pairs of actors , the actor will maintain N(N 1 ) such distributions . For
Beta distributions
Figure 3 . Belief State of actor Ak , with beliefs as this distribution maintaining over all possible parameters of a Bernoulli distribution , a Beta distribution is used . Since , the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior for the Bernoulli distribution , a Bayesian inference on the parameters of a Beta distribution is the most likely choice for maintaining actors’ “ beliefs ” . We define the belief state of an actor to be a set of N(N 1 ) Beta distributions , where each Beta distribution J(x,y ) is defined over the corresponding Bernoulli distribution L(x,y ) . If we denote the belief state for a given actor Ak by Bk , then Bk = {J(i,j)k for all order pairs ( Ai,Aj ) such that Ai ≠ Aj} where , J(i,j)k , the Beta distribution over the parameter of L(i,j ) , is defined as Ak ’s belief regarding the communication from Ai to Aj ( see figure 3 ) . The probability density function for a Beta distribution with parameters α and β is ,

The above expression gives the probability density of a Bernoulli distribution that has probabilities p and 1 p ( or parameter p ) . Higher values of α relative to β cause the Beta distribution to favor Bernoulli distributions with higher values of p and vice versa . The expected value for the parameter p ( based on the Beta distribution ) of the Bernoulli distribution is given by ,
[ pE
= ]
α +
βα
Thus , the expected Bernoulli distribution ie {E[p ] , 1 E[p]} is obtained by simply normalizing the parameters of the Beta distribution . Normally the parameters α and β are associated with particular outcomes of the Bernoulli trials over which the Beta distribution is defined . For example , if the Bernoulli distribution is over the probability p of obtaining heads on a coin toss , then a Beta distribution over the possible values of p is defined as follows . The parameter α is taken as the number of times heads is observed and parameter β is the number of times is observed . For each observation of heads , α is tails incremented by 1 and on observing tails β is incremented by 1 . This is same as Bayesian inference using a Beta distribution . For each Beta distribution J(x,y)k in the belief state Bk of actor Ak , there are two parameters α(x,y ) and β(x,y ) . Based on the communication Ak observes , he/she updates the parameters for all J(x,y)k in Bk . Each email observed by the actor is a Bernoulli trial , where success for the Bernoulli L(x,y ) is realized only if the email is from Ax with Ay being a recipient . We associate the parameter α(x,y ) with the number of successes , ie the number of emails , observed by Ak , that have been sent by Ax to Ay , and parameter β(x,y ) with failures ie number of emails , observed by Ak , that are either not sent by Ax or Ay is not a recipient or both . Over time , as Ak observes communication in the network , he/she maintains the parameters ( for the various Beta distributions ) by incrementing the corresponding parameters each observation time . This is equivalent to Bayesian inference using Beta distribution , based on the observed communication .
3.3 Priors Selection This sub section addresses the issue of selecting priors for the parameters of each of the distributions J(x,y)k in a given belief state Bk . We choose priors such that α(x,y)=δxεy|x and β(x,y)=1α(x,y ) , where δx is the prior probability for Ax being the sender of an email and εy|x is the prior probability for Ay being a recipient given that Ax has sent the email . Each probability in an actor ’s belief state the communication in the network . Hence , the sum of the expected probabilities for all communications must always be greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to ( N 1 ) ( see appendix A ) . Since , the events of different actors being senders is mutually exclusive , we must have ∑δi = 1 . A simple solution is to go with uniform priors where each δx=1/N , N being the number of actors . For εy|x also we choose uniform priors ie the events of Ay being a recipient or not , given that the email has been sent by Ax , can be equally likely . In this case we assign εy|x=05 Thus , a simple solution for priors is α(x,y)=1/2N and β(x,y)=1(1/2Ν ) . This choice of priors will not have much effect as the number of observations is usually relatively large compared to the prior magnitudes , which results in the “ washing out ” of priors . Thus small initial values of α(x,y ) and β(x,y ) imply the low confidence in the priors . is expressed as a fraction of
In the modeling of communication probabilities as Bernoulli distributions , we implicitly assume that these probabilities are constant over time . However , this may not hold , since as emails are sent out over time , these probabilities may change . This is illustrated in figure 4 a , where , the curve corresponds to the
( a )
( b )
Figure 4 . Communication probability as a Bernoulli distribution compared with the actual probability actual communication probabilities at each instance from time 0 to t and the straight line represents the same communication probability modeled as a Bernoulli distribution , at time t . To intervals of the dynamic nature of length δ each are defined and address this issue , we choose to capture the dynamic nature of the communication probabilities using time slicing . Distinct time the communication probabilities are assumed to be constant over each time interval . Hence , the Beta distribution parameters are maintained for a length of one time interval only , using the observations made in that time interval . For each new time interval , one can either completely wash out the previous observations and start with fresh default prior values for the parameters or one may choose to scale down the parameters obtained at the end of time interval t 1 , and use them as priors for the next time interval t . This is but an approximation towards capturing the communication probabilities , with the accuracy inversely dependent on the length of the time window ( see figure 4 b ) . The optimum size of the time window will usually depend on the nature of the social network whose actors’ beliefs are being modeled . To model the temporally varying nature of beliefs , we denote the belief state of an actor at time t as Bk,t . Formally , the belief state for the given actor Ak at the given time t , is defined as , Bk,t = {J(i,j)k,t for all order pairs ( Ai,Aj ) such that Ai ≠ Aj} . Here J(i,j)k,t is the Beta distribution , for a given ordered pair of actors ( Ai,Aj ) , maintained by the actor Ak , at time t . The belief state of a given actor at time t reflects what the actor believes to be the probabilities of the possible strengths of different actor communications in the network at time t . A socio cognitive network at a given time is the set of belief states of all actors at that time . We start with an initial belief state for each actor , ie Bk,0 for all 1 ≤ k ≤ N , with parameters for all distributions having default prior values . As actors to observe email communication , they update their belief states . In a socio cognitive network , we also introduce a “ superactor ” , ie an actor who observes all the communication in the network . Such an actor is analogous to an entity such as the email server . AS the “ super actor ” observes all , its beliefs represent the complete and true knowledge . Hence , we will use this “ super actor ” as a benchmark when we compare actors’ beliefs with reality . This conforms to the closed world assumption where all that has occurred is observed by the superactor and anything that the super actor has not observed does not occur . The super actor is treated similar to any other actor wrt assigning priors and time slicing .
The Beta distributions in the belief state of an actor are completely expressed through their parameters . Therefore , in order to maintain the belief states one needs to maintain a set of counters corresponding the various parameters . For maintaining each of the α(x,y ) parameters a set of N(N 1 ) counters is used ; one for each Beta distribution . In addition , a counter is maintained for the total number of emails observed by each actor . The β(x,y ) parameter can be obtained by subtracting the α(x,y ) counter from the “ total number of emails ” counter . Counters for each of the α(x,y ) parameters are initialized with their corresponding priors and the “ total number of emails ” counter starts with an initial value of ( α(x,y)+β(x,y) ) . All counters maintained by an actor keep track only of the communication observed by that actor . Thus , the maintenance of all actors’ as well as is implemented . Algorithm 1 shows the process for belief update .
3.4 Time Complexity Analysis Consider an email sent in the communication network . Let the average number of recipients in the To , Cc and Bcc fields be nto , ncc and nbcc , respectively . The sender and the super actor will be able to perceive all the recipients of the mail and so will update a total of 2(nto+ncc+nbcc ) parameters ( all ordered pairs of the form ( sender , x ) where x is an actor in the To , Cc and Bcc fields ) in their belief states . Each Bcc recipient observes all recipients in the To and Cc fields as well as itself , hence it will update nto+ncc+1 parameters . This makes a total of ( nbcc)(nto+ncc+1 ) updates for all Bcc recipients . The actors appearing in the To and Cc fields will not observe the Bcc field actors as recipients . Hence they will update nto+ncc entries each in their belief states . This makes a total of ( ncc+nto)(ncc+nto ) updates for the To and Cc recipients . Also , each actor updates its counter of total emails observed , which results in another nto+ncc+nbcc+2 updates . Thus , aggregate of , 2(nbcc+ncc+nto)+(ncc+nto)(ncc+nto)+(nbcc)(nto+ncc+1)+(nto+ncc+ nbcc+2 ) parameter updates . Thus , the average complexity of belief update for an email exchange is O(n2 ) where , n is the average number of recipients of an email . the super actor ’s belief states exchange email the causes an
4 . ANALYSIS OF BELIEF CONFLICT AND DIVERGENCE FROM REALITY What an actor perceives regarding the communication network around it can be quite different from what is actually happening . Also , what one actor perceives about the social network can be quite different from another actor ’s perception . In this section , we present two types of analyses one can perform using the socio cognitive network constructed above . The first is the divergence of actors’ beliefs from reality and the second is conflict in different actors’ beliefs . But first we define the concept of divergence or closeness between two belief states .
4.1 Divergence across Beliefs and Belief States Consider two actors Ax and Ay with belief states Bx,t and By,t at time t . In computing the conflict between Bx,t with By,t we compare the beliefs in one set with the corresponding beliefs in the other set . For this the KL divergence across the expected Bernoulli distributions for is computed . two respective beliefs the
The expected Bernoulli distribution for a belief the expectation of the Beta distribution corresponding to that belief . If J(a,b)k,t is the Beta distribution , then the corresponding expected Bernoulli distribution can be denoted by E[J(a,b)k,t ] , which is obtained by normalizing the parameters of Beta distribution J(a,b)k,t . is yxJE

According to [ 1 ] Bregman divergences between corresponding features of two entities can be aggregated into a single divergence ( which can be taken as the divergence between the two entities themselves ) by taking a convex combination of the Bregman distances for each of the features . KL divergence is a Bregman divergence and different beliefs are analogous to features of a belief state . Thus , we determine the divergence across two belief states by taking a convex combination of the KL divergences across corresponding beliefs .

Note that the numerator in div(Bx,t,By,t ) sums up KL distances for only those beliefs which belong to the intersection of the belief states Bx,t and By,t . The denominator is a normalization factor which ensures that div(Bx,t,By,t ) does not depend on the number of intersecting beliefs since , the number of intersecting beliefs may vary for different pairs of actors . This is equivalent to taking a convex combination of the KL divergences obtained for different beliefs in the belief state , where beliefs that are not in the intersection are given a weight of 0 and all the other beliefs are given a uniform weight of

The the beliefs corresponding to only those communications for which both Ax and Ay have observed at least one instance . For example , if both Ax and Ay have observed at least one email from actor Ai with Aj being a recipient , then the belief corresponding to this communication is included in the intersection of Bx,t and By,t . If either one of Ax or Ay has not observed even one instance of this communication then that belief would not be included in the intersection of Bx,t and By,t . The following are the reasons for considering only those beliefs which are in the intersection ( of the belief states ) rather than all of them . The communication network will normally be quite sparse , ie out of all possible ordered pairs of actors only a few of them will actually communicate . Therefore , the belief states of the actors being compared will be even sparser and the beliefs associated with majority of communications will be derived from the prior values for both the actors . In such a case , it is desirable to consider only those beliefs for which both the actors have observed at least one instance . This is analogous to determining document similarity , where one computes similarity based only on those words that are present in both the documents . Another reason for using the intersection of beliefs is that , if the whole set of beliefs is considered while computing divergence across two belief states , one implicitly assumes that the two actors are aware of the presence of all actors ( since they entertain beliefs regarding every possible pair of communication ) in the social network , which is quite unrealistic . An interpretation of the proposed divergence measure is as follows : Consider three actors Ax , Ay and Az . Suppose we want to determine how divergent are Ay ’s and Az ’s belief states from that of Ax ’s . If Ay and Ax have few beliefs in common , but low divergence for each of these few common beliefs then their belief states are closer than those of Az and Ax , who have a relatively larger number of common beliefs with greater divergence across them . The concept of divergence across belief states of two actors is an open issue and multiple interpretations and arguments are possible , many of which can be intuitively appealing . However , not all of them can be captured with just one type of measure .
If two actors have no beliefs in common , ie the intersection of their belief states is empty then we take the divergence between their belief states to be infinity . Note that the divergence across two belief states is an asymmetric measure ie div(Bx,t,By,t ) ≠ div(By,t,Bx,t ) .
4.2 a closeness Measure In addition to being asymmetric the divergence of one belief state from another , div(Bx,t,By,t ) ranges from 0 to infinity . This makes it inconvenient to work with . Therefore , using this divergence measure we define a closeness measure which we call a closeness .
DEFINITION 3 ( a closeness ) . The a closeness measure is defined as the level of agreement between two given actors Ax and Ay with belief states Bx,t and By,t respectively , at a given time t and is given by , a

Note that a closeness between two belief states is symmetric and ranges from 0 to 1 , with 0 indicating minimum and 1 indicating maximum closeness between the two belief states . If two belief states have no beliefs in common then their a closeness measure is 0 ( corresponding to infinite divergence across the belief states ) . The mean a closeness across all ordered pairs of all ( or a group ) of actors is an indication of the general consensus among them . Lower values for mean a closeness indicate lower levels of consensus , and higher values indicate higher levels of consensus between the actors . The standard deviation across all actors , for a closeness is indicative of the variance in the agreement of actors in the network .
4.3 r closeness Measure The second type of analysis on a socio cognitive network is to measure how close is an actor ’s belief state to reality ( ie belief state of super actor ) . For this purpose we define the r closeness measure .

Where BS,t is the belief state of the super actor AS at time t . implies maximum closeness and 0
Similar to a closeness , for r closeness we consider only those beliefs present in the intersection of the actor ’s and the superactor ’s belief states ie only those beliefs corresponding to the communications for which the actor has observed at least one email . Philosophically the proposed r closeness measure can be interpreted as the following : An actor who has accurate beliefs regarding only few communications is closer to reality than some other actor who has a relatively larger number of less accurate beliefs . Thus , depth of knowledge is preferred over breadth of knowledge . Note that r closeness(Ak ) uses the asymmetric divergence of Ak ’s belief state from that of the super actor . The measure r closeness ranges from 0 to 1 , where 1 implies maximum divergence from reality . The mean r closeness across all actors provides an aggregate measure of the general “ knowledge ” or “ level of perception ” in the network . The higher the mean rcloseness , the more actors in the network know about other actors’ communications , ie the communication is transparent . A lower mean value for r closeness indicates that actors generally have “ misperceptions ” regarding other actors’ communications . This will normally be observed for a large social network consisting of various diverse groups , where it is difficult for a single actor to capture all the communication in the network . The standard deviation for r closeness across different actors indicates the variance in the levels of perception by them .
5 . APPLICATIONS OF PROPOSED MEASURES 5.1 r closeness Krackhardt [ 4 ] has explained that an actor ’s perception of who communicates with whom is a function of his social position . In case of an organizational environment , it is believed that top actors in the formal organizational hierarchy have better knowledge about communication than lesser actors and hence better perceptions about the social network . In other words , executive management has a better perception of the social network as compared to employees . Intuitively it is also expected that , the more communication an actor observes the better will be his/her perceptions regarding the social interactions occurring in the organization . The proposed rcloseness measure can be used to test such hypotheses , where the actor ’s perception of reality needs to be quantified .
5.2 a closeness The a closeness measures the similarity in social perceptions of two actors . Therefore , one potential application of the acloseness measure is to construct a graph of “ who agrees with whom ” . In such a graph , actors are represented by nodes and an edge is present between two actors only if their a closeness measure is more than a certain threshold . It is an undirected graph . The “ who agrees with whom ” graph has very useful applications . Classical social network analysis techniques developed for social networks ( or the socio centric graph ) can be applied on the “ who agrees with whom ” graph , resulting in a whole new class of analysis techniques with different domain interpretations . For example , cliques are identified in order to determine strong communities or groups in a social network Analogous to this , cliques in the agreement graph reveals clusters of actors with similar perceptions . The actors in each of these clusters may have similar roles or settings ( spatial proximity , same project or department ) . Other popular structures to look for are the “ bow tie ” ( signifying articulation points ) , “ star ” ( central actors ) and “ bridge ” . Degree centrality measures the importance of an actor based on its location in the social network . In the “ who agrees with whom ” graph , degree centrality can be used to determine the most important actor based on the number of other actors sharing its perceptions .
6 . EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
6.1 Enron Email Corpus The Enron email corpus is the set of emails belonging to about 151 users , mostly senior management of Enron , exchanged between mid 1998 and mid 2002 ( approximately 4 years ) . The time period includes the Enron crisis which broke out in October 2001 . The cleaned email corpus ( no email attachments and no integrity issues ) is publicly available and can be downloaded from http://wwwcscmuedu/~enron/ For our experiments , we chose to use a further clean version , in which duplicate , erroneous and junk emails have been removed . It is made available by Shetty and Abidi [ 7 ] . It consists of 252,759 email messages for the set of 151 users . For experimental analysis , we chose to use the entire set of 151 users and only those emails which were exchanged between these 151 users . There were 20,311 such emails . To capture the dynamic nature of the communication probabilities , time was divided into

621 r closeness The r closeness across actors is examined for two different months . We choose to compare the month of crisis , October 2001 with a relatively normal month in the life of the organization , October 2000 . For each of these months , users were ranked in the decreasing order of r closeness . Using the rankings for October 2000 , we study two hypotheses ( discussed in section 5.1 ) of interest to sociologists .
H1 . As one moves higher up the organizational hierarchy , actors have a better perception of the social network .
From the r closeness rankings , it is observed that majority of the top positions were occupied by employees . In fact , out of the top 10 ranks only 2 of them at the 8th and 10th positions are executive management users . Other ranks were occupied by 6 employees , 1 in house lawyer and 1 user with an unidentified level executives were designation . Some of communicatively few perceptions . therefore had very inactive and the higher
H2 . The more communication an actor observes , the better will be his/her perception regarding the social network
It was observed that even though some actors observed a lot of communication , they were still ranked low in terms of rcloseness . A reason was that these actors focus more on certain communications and less on the rest . As a result their perceptions regarding the social network are skewed towards these “ favored ” communications . Executive management actors who observed a lot of communication showed a tendency for this “ skewed perception ” behavior .
For October , 2000 , the actors can be roughly divided into three categories . The first category consists of actors who are communicatively active and observe a lot of diverse communications . These actors occupy the topmost positions in the rankings . They are followed by the second category actors

Others who also observe a lot of communication ; however , their observations are skewed which in turn leads to skewed perceptions . The third category consists of actors who are communicatively inactive and hardly observe any of the communication . These actors have low r closeness values and are at the bottom of the rankings table .

The rankings for the crisis month Oct , 2001 are significantly different from those of Oct , 2000 . Note the increase in the percentage of senior executive management level actors in the top 50 ranks at the cost of some of the employees being pushed down . Thus , we observe a shift from the normal behavior , indicating that communication perceived by most executive management actors were more diverse and evenly distributed as compared to the skewed or no perceptions in Oct 2000 . A reason for this could be one pointed out in [ 3 ] viz . during the crisis month emails were exchanged across different levels of formal hierarchy in the organization . Table 2 summarizes the statistics for r closeness rankings for the month of Oct , 2001.Figure 6 is a plot of mean r closeness of all actors over time . An interesting pattern is that the mean r closeness peaks during the crisis month of October 2001 , indicating a general increase in the perception of social interactions during the crisis period . After the crisis period , mean r closeness drops down . 622 a closeness Using the a closeness measure we constructed the agreement graph for the months of Oct , 2000 and Oct , 2001 . An edge was drawn between two actors only if the a closeness between them was more than a threshold of 095 A big organization like Enron , has many intra organizational groups . Normally , the intra group communication inter group communication is low . Therefore , one can expect the “ who agrees with whom ” graph to consist of many small , disjoint components of users . This is precisely what we observe for the Oct , 2000 graph ( Figure 7 ) . is high and the
Notice some of the structures ie cliques , bowties and stars which can be found in the graph . For Oct , 2001 the agreement graph ( Figure 8 ) mainly consists of one large connected component , quite dense at the center and encompassing most of the actors . This indicates that the interaction between employees during the crisis month crossed all boundaries which resulted in high overlap in their social perceptions .
Figure 9 shows a plot of the mean a closeness , across all pairs of actors against time . Note the very low value for mean acloseness in the month of Oct , 2000 , as expected in a big organization intra organization groups . There is a sharp increase in mean a closeness for the months of Oct , 2001 and Feb , 2002 . Oct , 2001 was the crisis month and Feb , 2002 was the month when the investigations regarding the crisis occurred . like Enron having various

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS The popularity of online social networks and the ability to collect gigabytes of unbiased social information about individuals provides a unique opportunity for computer scientists to develop new computational techniques for mining social network patterns . this paper , we provide a computational model for modeling individual ’s perceptions of communication between other individuals in an email based social network . Two new measures are proposed namely rcloseness , individual ’s perceptions from reality , and a closeness , to capture the difference of perceptions between different individuals . An agreement graph is proposed to capture relationships of similar perceptions between individuals . The use of these measures to find interesting patterns from social network perspective is illustrated using the Enron email data . Such computational techniques for socio cognitive analysis can have widespread impact in the understanding of social networks . A possible future research direction is to explore further analysis techniques ( eg . centrality measures ) for the agreement graph . Another future research direction is to extend the proposed approach eg . assigning different weights to a recipient based on whether the he/she is in To or Cc or Bcc fields . the divergence of an

If the expected communication probabilities in the belief state of an actor do not satisfy the above inequality then we say that the actor ’s belief state is “ invalid ” ( ie the particular set of expected communication probabilities inferred by the actor cannot actually exist ) .
PROPOSITION 1 . If the prior probabilities of a belief state are such the posterior probabilities will also result in a valid belief state . the belief state is valid , then that
Let the communication probability P(i,j ) have prior probability xij . Suppose α(i,j ) = xij and β(i,j ) = 1 xij . Then the expected communication probability will be ,

The above proof also holds for the case when priors for Beta distribution parameters do not sum up to 1 ie α(x,y ) = rxij and β(x,y ) = r α(x,y ) , where r is some real valued scaling factor indicating ■ the confidence in the prior probability xij
The priors xij can be expressed a product δiεj|i , where δi is prior for Pi and εj|i is prior for Pj|i . In some cases instead of directly working with xij , it might be easier to fix δi and εj|i such that ( 8 ) is satisfied .
