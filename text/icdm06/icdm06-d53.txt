Abstract
Much work on skewed , stochastic , high dimensional , and biased datasets usually implicitly solve each problem separately . Recently , we have been approached by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ( TCEQ ) to help them build highly accurate ozone level alarm forecasting models for the Houston area , where these technical difficulties come together in one single problem . Key characteristics of this problem that are challenging and interesting include : 1 ) the dataset is sparse ( 72 features , and 2 % or 5 % positives depending on the criteria of “ ozone days ” ) , 2 ) evolving over time from year to year , 3 ) limited in collected data size ( 7 years or around 2500 data entries ) , 4 ) contains a large number of irrelevant features , 5 ) is biased in terms of “ sample selection bias ” , and 6 ) the true model is stochastic as a function of measurable factors . Besides solving a difficult application problem , this dataset offers a unique opportunity to explore new and existing data mining techniques , and to provide experience and guidance for similar problems . Our main technical focus addresses on how to estimate reliable probability given both sample selection bias and a large number of irrelevant features , and how to choose the most reliable decision threshold to predict the unknown future with different distribution . On the application side , the prediction accuracy of our approach is 20 % higher in recall ( correctly detects 1 to 3 more ozone days , depending on the year ) and 10 % higher in precision ( 15 to 30 fewer false alarm days per year ) than state of the art methods used by air quality control scientists , and these results are significant for TCEQ .
1 Introduction and Motivation
Ground ozone level depends on a sophisticated chemical and physical process as a function of many known and unknown factors , and stochastic in nature ( i.e , with the same set of currently observable variables , the ozone level can differ from time to time ) . It has been an active topic for air quality study , an interdisciplinary field among atmospheric research , geochemistry , and geophysics , for many years since an ozone level above some well known threshold is rather harmful for human health , and affects other important parts of our daily life , such as farming , tourism etc . Therefore an accurate ozone alert forecasting system is necessary to issue warnings to the public before the ozone reaches a dangerous level . In air quality study , the estimation of ozone level uses known physical and chemistry reaction theories that attempt to explain the “ true ” mechanisms . There are several such theories around . As a result of these research , simulation systems , physical formulas and parametric models are created to calculate ozone level .
However , due to the difficulty of the problem and still limited knowledge about the true physical and chemical mechanism , existing approaches can only use a rather small number of parameters ( ≤ 10 ) , and are still rather inaccurate and can be costly to build . However , it is a common belief among environmental scientists that a significant large number of other features currently never explored yet are very likely useful in building highly accurate ozone prediction model . Yet , little is known on exactly what these features are and how they actually interact in the formation of ozone . Information available is rather speculative in the sense that we roughly know a rather exhaustive set of features out there . Indeed , this candidate list contains over 60 features . As mentioned earlier , none of today ’s environmental science knows as of yet how to use them . This provides a wonderful opportunities for data mining . As discussed in Section 1.3 , the combination of rare class , large number of possibly irrelevant features , small training set size , feature selection bias , among others , is an interesting and challenging problem .
1.1 Seriousness of the Ozone Problem
Ground level ozone O3 , the key ingredients of smog , is not emitted directly to the air like other air pollutants , but
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 is formed as a result of a series of complex chemical reaction of VOCs ( Volatile Organic Compounds ) and NOx ( or Nitrogen Oxides ) in the presence of heat and sunlight . VOCs are emitted from a variety of sources , including motor vehicles , chemical plants , refineries , factories , and other industrial sources . Nitrogen oxides are emitted from motor vehicles , power plants , and other combustion devices such as off road engines . Studies have shown that short term up to a few hours exposure to elevated ambient ozone can cause a number of health problems , such as asthma , chest pain and coughing [ 2 ] . The effects of long term exposure is less established , although a few studies have associated long term exposure to elevated ozone with decreases in lung function , exacerbation of existing asthma and causing new asthma [ 9 ] . Besides the effects on human health , elevated ozone level also has negative effects on vegetation and ecosystems , leading to reductions in agricultural and commercial forest yields , and increases plant susceptibility to disease , pests , and other environmental stresses . As part of the mandate of Clean Air Act , United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) established the National Ambient Air Quality Standards ( NAAQS ) to regulate pollutants . In July 1997 , the EPA announced a new 8 hour 80 parts per billion ( ppb ) standard as an amendment to the previous 1hour 120 ppb standard . The new standard is for the protection against longer exposure to the ground level ozone . The 8 hour ozone is the average of the ozone concentration of the past 8 hours . As a good case study , the Houston/Galveston/Brazoria ( HGB ) area of southeast Texas has been experiencing some of the highest ozone levels recently recorded in North America , outpacing Los Angeles as the city with the most violation days in 1999 [ 6 ] . Recently , in 2004 , the HGB area has a total of 52 days with measured 8 hour ozone reaching the 80 ppb dangerous level . Currently the HGB is designated as a non attainment area by EPA under the 8 hour ozone standard . As the fourth largest city in the US , it is of great interest for Houston to achieve an attainment status before the EPA deadline in 2010 . In the mean time , to monitor and forecast high ozone days before it actually happens remains the top priorities for Texas Commission on Environmental Quality ( TCEQ ) .
1.2 State of the Art in Ozone Forecasting
Ozone level forecasting has been an active area for environmental science and meteorology . There are mainly two family of methods , air dynamic and statistical models . The dynamic forecasting uses 3 D air quality models to simulate the atmospheric processes that influence the formation , transport and dispersion of ozone . The statistical methods , on the other hand , find the empirical statistical correlation between ozone and atmospheric parameters such as wind , temperature , etc .
Two examples of dynamic models were used in the north of Spain [ 14 ] . The first model uses three modules for ozone forecasting . The mesoscale model ( MASS ) provides the initial condition to the non local boundary layer model based on the transient turbulence scheme , while the third module is a photochemical box model ( OZIPR ) in Eulerian and Lagrangian modes and receives necessary information from the two previous modules . Quite different from the first model , the second forecast model , called MM5/UAM V , is a grid model that predicts hourly 3D ozone concentration field . Both methods give good performance only for specific episode , but there is substantial computational cost in constructing these models and they are not portable to different locations , such as Houston . On the other hand , statistical forecasting is currently the most widely used method , primarily due to its low cost and competitive accuracy compared with the dynamic forecasting . Previously , various regression based methods including regression trees , parametric regression equation , and artificial neural network ( ANN ) , and others have been explored for specific datasets at different locations . However , Schlink et al [ 15 ] conducted an inter model comparison on 15 statistical techniques which were applied to ten data sets representing different meteorological and emission conditions throughout Europe . They found that none of the 15 techniques performs better than others in all aspects . Other nonregression based statistical methods explored previously include fuzzy logic [ 8 , 12 ] , and Bayesian network [ 11 ] .
1.3 Challenges as a Data Mining Problem
In environmental science , the true model for ozone days are believed to be stochastic in nature . In other words , given all relevant features in the feature vector xR , the probability of an ozone day y = “ ozone day ” conditional on xR is nontrivial . Formally , P ( y = “ ozone day ” |xR ) < 1 and can be described as a density over xR . When the problem is stochastic , predictive mistakes and errors are inevitable .
The dataset , described in detail in Section 2.1 , contains 2500+ examples with 72 continuous features . Depending on the criterion for ozone days , either 2 % or 5 % of them are truly positive for the Houston area in the past 7 years . For data mining , it is a rather skewed and relatively sparse distribution . Small number of examples and large number of features increase statistical bias and variance even if we know the true stochastic model P ( y|xR ) ’s exact form and use the training data to estimate parameters inside the model .
In the same time , only about 10 features among these 72 features have been verified by environmental scientists to be useful and relevant , and there is neither empirical nor theoretical information as of yet on the relevance of the other 60 features . However , air quality control scientists have been speculating for a long time that some of these features might
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 P ( y,xr,xir ) be useful , but just haven’t been able to either develop the theory or use simulations to justify their relevance . Part of our task is to test their possible relevancy using data mining techniques . This ought to be pursued with caution though , since the presence of a large number of features that are possibly irrelevant may seriously introduce overfitting problem . By definition , the collected feature set x and relevant feature set xR may not be the same , but are expected to have non empty intercept xR ∩ x = xr , and xr fi= ∅ . For convenience , define xir as the set of irrelevant features inside x , or formally , x = ( xr , xir ) . Since xir is independent from both y and xr , or formally , P ( y , xir ) = P ( y)P ( xir ) and P ( xr , xir ) = P ( xr)P ( xir ) , then P ( y|x ) is actually P ( y|xr ) . This is trivial since P ( y|x ) = P ( y|xr , xir ) = P ( xr)P ( xir ) = P ( y|xr ) . However the P ( xr ,xir ) = P ( y,xr)P ( xir ) derivation P ( y|x ) = P ( y|xr ) is only true when the dataset is exhaustive , and this is clearly not the case for 7 years of ozone data . In effect , irrelevant features change the probability distribution represented in the data . For a normal day training example ( x , y = “ normal day ” ) , irrelevant features tend to push the probability P ( y = “ ozone day ” |x ) down towards 0 . Considering those irrelevant features , there is likely just one example with all these similar feature values ( both xr and xir ) that is a normal day . On the other hand , for ozone day example , irrelevant features are likely to push up the probability to 1 . Intuitively , as more irrelevant features are introduced into the feature vector , the empirical probability conditional on irrelevant features tends to get closer to the two extreme cases , either 1 for ozone days or 0 for normal days .
On the other hand , the date of the ozone alarm cannot be ignored , since an inductive model trained from historical data will be used to predict ozone alarm in the future , and the number of “ ozone days ” varies from year to year in the Houston area . Considering the date , the problem can be formulated as either a “ data stream ” or “ sample selection bias ” problem . Evolving data stream is best described by changes in joint probability distribution P ( x , y ) = P ( y|x)P ( x ) . For ozone alarm forecasting , the physical law P ( y|xR ) does not change over time , and as a result , neither P ( y|x ) nor P ( y|xr ) is expected to change . Observable values of P ( y|x ) may change , however , this is due to limited number of labeled examples . Under evolving data stream framework , the only possible change is in feature vector probability distribution P ( x ) . In this sense , it is equivalent to “ feature sample selection bias ” as described below .
The dataset can be equally formulated as a “ sample selection bias ” problem [ 16 ] . Assume that s = 1 denotes that an example ( x , y ) is sampled from the universe of examples into the training set , and s = 1 denotes that ( x , y ) is not selected . Sample selection bias is best described by a dependency of s = 1 on feature vector x and class label y or P ( s = 1|x , y ) . The sample selection bias is called a
“ feature bias ” , if it is explicitly dependent on feature vector x and conditionally independent from class label y or P ( s = 1|x , y ) = P ( s = 1|x ) . Ozone day forecasting is an example of feature bias , since the training data set obviously is unlikely to contain too many “ days ” that are very similar to the future . Where there is sample selection bias , there are two closely related challenges , 1 ) how to train an accurate model given sample selection bias , and 2 ) how to effectively use a model to predict the future with a different and yet unknown distribution .
1.4 Our Contributions
Our work in this paper has made two main categories of contributions , one is a solution for ozone alarm forecasting that is more accurate than state of the art methods adopted by TCEQ , and the other is the experience to formulate the application as a data mining problem , analyze its unique combinations of technical challenges , as well as the process to search for the most suitable solutions . Besides the process to find the satisfactory solutions , the most important technical contributions are as follows : system used by TCEQ . that environmental scientists have been speculating .
• More accurate ozone forecasting system than current • Empirically show the relevance of about 60 features • How to estimate reliable probability from a data set with a lot of possibly irrelevant features and very small number of examples dataset . • How to choose the best decision threshold to use a model trained from historical data to predict on new data under sample selection bias where neither feature vector nor true label is known before hand .
2 Ozone Alarm Forecasting Problem
We start by describing how the Houston area data is col lected , the feature sets and ozone forecasting task .
2.1 Houston Area Dataset Collection
We collected various meteorology and ozone data for the Houston , Galveston , and Brazoria ( HGB ) area . Seventytwo data attributes are extracted from several databases within two major federal data warehouse and one local database for air quality control . These are EPA AQS ( Air Quality System ) and NCDC ( National Climate Data Center ) [ 13 ] from the federal government as well as CAMS ( Continuous Ambient Monitoring Stations ) operated by TCEQ . The EPA AQS database is the national repository for information about airborne pollutants in the United States ,
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 and it provides the sensory information that is used in the regulatory feedback . Ozone exceeding above the National Air Quality Standard are based on the AQS data . The NCDC is the world ’s largest active archive of meteorological data . In addition , the CAMS database archives some detailed air parameters and local meteorological data not available in the federal database . Since each database contains many site stations , and there are several of these stations within the HGB area , we have chosen the information collected either at or closest to IAH Bush International Airport for the study . This is because the weather station at IAH is the only one that records a wide range of hourly weather parameters in the HGB area . In addition , the archived datasets at IAH have the longest recording history , and usually the least missing value and erroneous readings . In summary , these 72 attributes contains various measures of air pollutant and meteorological information for the target area in our study .
Various air pollutant information from EPA AQS records and measures several sources of VOCs that contribute to the chemical reaction producing ozone in the target area . In addition , the CAMS Air database archives some additional air pollutants information not available from EPS AQS , and these include the amount of various air including carbon monoxide ( CO ) , nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) , sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) , nitric oxide ( NOx ) , fine particular matters ( PM10 and PM2.5 ) , oxides of nitrogen , and hydrogen sulfide . When the recorded value for the same measurement is different between EPA AQS and CAMS , their average is used in our studies .
Since the meteorology at both surface level and upper atmospheric level provides the physical condition that influences the formation , transport and dispersion of pollutants that contribute to ozone , meteorological data from both levels were obtained for modeling . NCDC Surface Airways ( SA ) database contains surface data such as relative humidity , ceiling height , sky cover , and etc . Other surface level features such ground wind speed and direction , and temperature , etc , are obtained from CAMS . For upper air data , NCDC Raodiosonde Data of North America dataset provides radiosonde observation ( RAOB ) record dated back to 1946 . There are six RAOB stations in Texas . However , we use the data from the RAOB station in Lake Charles , Louisiana because it is the closest to Houston . Fifteen variables are extracted from RAOB , including temperature ( T ) , geopotential height ( HT ) , dew point , wind speed and direction at the 850 , 700 , and 500 hPa levels . The variables are sampled twice a day and the average is used in the study . The wind speed and direction are converted to U ( east west ) component and V ( south north ) component . Additional variables that may affect the air quality include previous day pollutant level ( for carry over effect ) and day type ( workday or non workday , which affects NOX emis sions ) . In summary , seven ( 1998 2004 ) years hourly ozone data , meteorological surface data and daily upper air meteorological data are collected in this study .
2.2 Current Forecasting System
Since 1999 , TCEQ started to issue ozone warning for public awareness for 9 metropolitan areas within Texas , including the HGB area . TCEQ forecasts are primarily based on the Criteria method [ 2 ] . It is an expert rule based system developed over the years . Daily weather forecasts from National Weather Service ( NWS ) are fed into the Criteria model to predict if ozone levels will reach or exceed a target level for a particular area . The criteria for the HGB area is based on a rather small set of parameters , such as , previous day ozone , maximum temperature and wind . The rules set are different for each month in the forecast ozone seasons , March to November for HGB area . In [ 10 ] , researchers at TCEQ proposed a parametric ozone prediction model , called “ local ozone peak model ” , based on monitored wind speed , temperature , and solar radiation , in conjunction with monitored estimates of upwind background levels . In this paper , we use the ozone peak model as base line since it is the model currently promoted by TCEQ . This local ozone peak model uses the upwind ozone background level ( default as 50 [ 2] ) , the maximum temperature in degrees F , the base temperature where net ozone production begins ( 50F ) , the solar radiation total of the day , the wind speed near sunrise and midday . The emission factor can take values from 0 to 1 . The following equation summarizes the parametric equation and the parameters involved .
O3 = U pwind + EmF actor × ( T max − T b ) × SRd W Sa × 0.1 + W Sp × 0.5 + 1

3 Addressing Data Mining Challenges
We address those challenges as raised in Section 13
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 3.1 Direct Adaptations
Instead of predicting on class labels , it is well known that a more effective approach on skewed and stochastic distribution is to directly estimate the probability distribution itself and then choose the best decision threshold to optimize on some given criteria , such as a compromise between precision and recall .
In general , they are two families of methods , either descriptive or generative , and sometimes called , nonparametric or parametric . Descriptive methods , such as decision trees , make rather loose assumption about the form of the true unknown probability distribution . Both the structure of the hypothesis and parameters within the hypothesis are estimated from the labeled training data . On the other hand , generative methods , such as naive Bayes and logistic regression , assume that the true conditional probability follows a “ particular form ” . The formula is fixed and learning is to estimate the parameters used inside the formula with Maximum Likelihood Estimation . Since little is known about the true probability distribution of ozone days as a function of the large number of features , it is hard to choose the right generative methods , therefore descriptive methods are preferred .
3.2 Reliable Probability Estimation under
Irrelevant Features
As discussed in Section 1.3 , the conditional probability represented in the training data can be P ( y|xr ) at its best if the dataset is exhaustively sampled . However , due to sample selection bias , it is in fact P ( y|xr , xir , s = 1 ) . As discussed earlier , the effect of irrelevant feature is to make the probability towards 0 or 1 or either under estimate or over estimate . ir
One way to solve this problem is to train multiple modIn els , each of which are from a random feature subset . ⊂ ⊂ xr and xs other words , the model is built from xs r xir . The effect to use a subset of xr can make the probability less “ sharp ” ( or away from 0 or 1 ) , and the effect of xs ir is to make the probability sharper , but could be either in the correct or wrong directions . However , different models trained from different feature subset is unlikely to change the probability in the same direction unless these features are correlated . Without any knowledge about what features are relevant and which ones are not , the safest approach is to construct multiple models from different feature subset and average their predictions . This is because on average , the multiple model will not perform worse than any of the single models , an issue explained further below . Yet , a separate way to look at this issue is that variance in bias and variance decomposition can be reduced significantly with model averaging . There are many ways to train models from different feature subset . One of the simplest and somehow less ad hoc approach is to train multiple decision trees in different ways . Since there are 72 features and only 2500 examples , a decision path can at most test 12 features ( 212 = 4096 ) . Therefore , two different trees are very unlikely to consider the same 12 features out of 72 . Assume all trees are uncorrelated in choosing features . Then , 30 trees can guarantee that all 72 features will be considered because ( 1 − 12
72)30 0004
Since the dependency on the irrelevant features xir cannot be ignored , every single model θ constructed from the labeled training data is likely an inaccurate estimator of P ( y|xr ) . Let us denote the estimated probability by θ as P ( y|x , θ ) . We show that the expected error to estimate P ( y|xr ) by averaging several models is no more than the expected error of any single model being averaged . This proof is adopted and modified from [ 1 ] .
Formally ,
M A(x ) =
1 K k
P ( y|x , θk ) = EP ( θ)(P ( y|x , θ ) )
( 2 )
The MSE for a single model θk is simply the expected difference between the true and estimated probabilities squared .
= Σx,yP ( x , y)(P ( y|xr ) − P ( y|x , θk))2 Errorθk = EP ( x,y)[P ( y|xr)2 − 2P ( y|xr)P ( y|x , θk ) + P ( y|x , θk)2 ]
( 3 )
In the above equation , the sum over which joint distribution , either the unbiased joint distribution P ( x , y ) or possibly biased distribution of the next year P ( x , y , s = near year ) , is insignificant . The expected MSE , if the model is chosen at random from a model space Θ , is then the same as Eq 3 except for there is an additional term P ( θ ) in the expectation .
ErrorSingleModel = Σθk
Σx,yP ( x , y ) × ( 4 )
( P ( y|xr ) − P ( y|x , θk))2 = EP ( θ),P ( x,y)[P ( y|xr)2 − 2P ( y|xr)P ( y|x , θk ) + P ( y|x , θk)2 ]
If we were to take T models at random from the model space and average their predictions then the expected performance is ErrMA = Σx,yP ( x , y)(P ( y|xr ) − EP ( θ)[P ( y|x , θ)])2 = EP ( x,y)[P ( y|xr)2 − 2P ( y|xr)EP ( θ)[P ( y|x , θ ) ] + EP ( θ)[P ( y|x , θ)]2 ] ≤ EP ( x,y)[P ( y|xr)2 − 2P ( y|xr)EP ( θ)[P ( y|x , θ ) ] +

( 6 )
Therefore , if were to perform many repeat experiments comparing conditional probability averaging against a single model , on average , conditional probability averaging would perform no worse than a single model .
3.3 Predicting on the Future Data with
Feature Selection Bias
When there is feature sample selection bias and the testing data is completely withheld from the training process , in other words , both its feature vector values and class label are not known in advance1 , the performance estimated from the procedure described below is expected to be very similar to its actual performance on the testing data .
1 . Use 10 fold cross validation on an algorithm to be considered .
2 . Concatenate the estimated probability values from 10 separate testing files into a single “ probability true label ” file . Each entry in the file corresponds to one example , and it includes the estimated probability using 10 fold CV and the true class label for that example . In our case , an entry would look like ( 0.7891 , “ ozone day ” ) or ( 0.2341 , “ normal day ” ) .
3 . Plot either precision recall or ROC plot by choosing “ unique ” values of probabilities to be “ decision threshold ” and applying the decision threshold on the “ probability true label ” file to compute a pair of precision and recall to be plotted . A straight forward implementation is as follows :
( a ) sort the “ probability true label ” file into one with increasing estimated probability .
( b ) choose each “ unique ” estimated probability as “ decision threshold ” , one by one from the sorted file . Let v be this chosen decision threshold .
( c ) If the estimated probability for an example in the probability true label file is more than a threshold v , predict it as an “ ozone day ” , otherwise , predict it as a “ normal day ” . The choice of v is discussed next .
( d ) for the sorted “ probability true label ” file , use examples with estimated probability equal to v be as the “ border line ” . Then , every entry below this
1This is a different situation from [ 3 ] . In [ 3 ] , the feature vector is known but not the class label . In our case , neither the feature vector nor the class label is known borderline will be labeled as “ normal day ” and every entry above and on this border line will be labeled as “ ozone day ” .
( e ) calculate the paired precision and recall corresponding to v , then plot recall and decision threshold v on the x axis , and resulting precision on the y axis . This can be either on the same plot or two separate plots .
4 . By reading from the precision threshold plot obtained above , choose a “ decision threshold ” vE that returns a reasonable compromise between recall and precision . Typically , when vE is high , precision is also high , but recall is low . This is especially true for the ozone day forecasting since the true model is stochastic . Assume that as a result of vE , the recall and precision are v and p . Ideally , there should be many adjacent points with similar recall and precision values that are close to v and p . As explained below , this can effectively prevents “ surprises ” .
5 . Train a new model θ using all available examples .
6 . Use θ to classify the future days . To be specific , the model predicts “ ozone days ” if the estimated probability by θ is more than vE . Formally , predict “ ozone day ” if P ( y = “ ozone days ” |x , θ ) ≥ vE .
We next argue the above process will return reasonable results for unseen future where neither feature vectors nor their true labels are known in advance . First , the precision recall plot is constructed by cross validation , and is still expected to be a reasonable estimate on the future testing data even under feature bias . Since neither the feature vector nor the prior ozone day probability for the coming year is known exactly , a better estimate would be quite hard to obtain . The cross validation process already implicitly takes feature bias into account . Every test set in 10 fold crossvalidation contains a rather small number of examples considering that the problem contains 72 features and 2500+ total number of examples . In other words , every test set is feature biased , but just could be biased differently from the days in the coming year . Nonetheless , when this process is repeated 10 times in cross validation , the precision recall plot is an average performance evaluated over 10 different feature bias distributions . Unless the feature distribution of the coming year is so different from the training data , such as due to catastrophic weather , the precision recall plot is expected to a reasonable prediction for the coming year .
Each point or a precision recall point , on the plot is estimated from cross validation . When these points appear rather continuous in the precision recall plot , and not many empty spaces in between adjacent points , the chance for surprises when using model θ with decision threshold vE on
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 the future days is little . The simple reason is that a continuous plot has more “ facts ” instead of “ speculations ” than a discontinuous or broken plot . One common held misconception about precision recall curve as well as ROC plot is that they are infinitely continuous . This is not the case in reality . The simple understanding is that validation data is limited in size and many learning techniques have limited number of “ unique ” predictions . The line segment connecting adjacent points in precision recall plot ( or ROC plot ) are not supported by any data . The connection is simply made for a visual line effect . For a chosen vE as described above , if its adjacent precision recall points are rather far away from vE on the plot , it increases the chance of performance difference on future days . For the future year ’s data , both the recall and precision given decision threshold vE are unlikely exactly the same as r and p , as one would otherwise read from the plot . For reassurance , it is preferable to have an idea on the approximate value if the estimate is indeed off . Obviously , a continuous precision recall plot can provide this information . On the contrary , for a broken or discontinuous plot , one could only speculate and assume that the “ visual lines ” are close to reality . For this reason , when choosing vE , one should also consider adjacent points . When two algorithms construct similar shaped precision recall plot , one should prefer the algorithm with a more “ continuous ” plot for the same reason .
4 Probabilistic Tree Models
The probabilistic decision tree models are suitable for the skewed ozone modeling and forecasting because they output “ semi continuous ” probabilities and a decisionthreshold can be chosen to find the most satisfactory compromise between recall and precision . There are two types of probability estimation trees a single tree estimator and an ensemble of trees . Obviously , the single tree is better for comprehensibility . However , it only approximates the true unknown model from one particular model representation and may not have high accuracy . The ensemble is preferred when accurate probability estimation is desired . c4.5 and c4.4 [ 7 ] are representatives of single tree , bagging trees and random decision tree [ 4 ] are examples of tree ensembles . It is important to point out that bagging trees in our study average over posterior probability , but seminal work on bagging uses voting of class labels . c4.4 A straightforward method to estimate class membership probability is to use the class frequency at the corresponding leaf . In our case , this is achieved by dividing the number of high ozone days by total number of days from the training data that are sorted into the classifying leaf node . It has been noted [ 7 ] that frequency based estimates of classmembership probability are not always accurate and statistically reliable . One reason is that the tree growing algo rithm searches for pure leaves , and tends to produce unrealistically high probability estimates , especially when the leaves cover few training examples . These estimates can be smoothed to mitigate these problems . As one of the simplest forms of smoothing , Laplace correction incorporates an equal prior for each class . Various experiments have showed that smoothing techniques can generally improve performance [ 7 , 5 ] . Importantly , Provost et al [ 7 ] pointed out that many heuristics for improving classification accuracy and minimizing tree size actually are biased “ against ” estimating accurate probabilities . For example , pruning via error reduction is blamed as the culprit . In summary , c4.4 is a variation of c4.5 by replacing frequency estimation with Laplace correction and turning off pruning and collapsing . Random Decision Trees Random decision tree [ 4 ] is an ensemble of individual trees , each of which is constructed “ randomly ” . To build each tree , a feature is randomly selected from remaining features on which the data is split on . Along a decision path , a discrete feature can be selected only once ; however , continuous features can be used multiple times , but each time with a different , randomly chosen splitting value . Features from the training data are used to construct tree structures , and the data values themselves are used to update the class probabilities recorded in the leaf nodes . For a testing example , each tree produces a class probability . Probabilities from all the trees in the ensemble are averaged to generate the overall class probability estimate . Normally , thirty trees is sufficient , and up to fifty trees may be necessary when the distribution is skewed . On average , the depth of a random tree is about half of the number of the features , whereby distinct features are most likely to be selected to maximize diversity for the ensemble .
5 Experimental Studies
Probabilistic decision trees are inductive methods that are constructed from labeled training examples and are affected by both sample selection bias ( feature bias in our case ) and amount of training data . However , parametric model used by TCEQ is not trained , but simply calculates the ozone level using some features for the day and is therefore not affected by either sample selection bias or amount of training data . Given these differences , both “ exhaustive ” cross validation tests that ignore the time stamp of the data ( therefore alleviating problem of sample selection bias and number of training examples ) , and incremental tests that build models from previous years and test on subsequent years are necessary . In particular , cross validation tests are important from algorithmic point of view , since it will demonstrate the levels of accuracy that can be achieved when there are reasonable number of training examples and not really biased . On the other hand , incremental tests can help reveal the limit of each algorithm when the number of

5.1 Cross validation Experiments
In 10 fold cross validation experiments , the time stamp of each day is omitted , and the 7 years worth of ozone data is completely shuffled prior to generating training and testing pairs . Seven decision tree algorithms are applied on the data for both 1 hr and 8 hr peak detection . These include baggingc4.5 , baggingc4.4 , random decision tree with half depth rdh , and full depth rdf , c4.4 as well as c4.5 with and without pruning . Each tree model computes a posterior probability P ( y = “ ozone day ” |x , θ ) . This notation explicitly specifies its dependency on the feature vector x for each day as well as some decision tree model θ . It is important to understand that the dependency on θ cannot be ignored since each model estimates probability based on its trained model M and it may not be the true probability P ( y = “ ozone day ” |x ) . We choose a subjective decision threshold vE , and whenever P ( y = “ ozone day ” |x , θ ) ≥ vE , we issue an alert . Obviously , with different values of vE , different recall and precision will result . Normally with decreasing vE , recall increases but precision tends to decrease . We say that model θa is preferred over θb , if the precision of θa is consistently higher than θb under the same recall numbers . It is important to observe how the recall and precision are correlated for each chosen algorithm . The resulting recall and precision results are plotted in a “ recall precision ” chart with x axis as the recall and y axis as the precision . This is similar to ROC , but is more straightforward for meteorologists .
Each probabilistic decision tree algorithm does not generate exactly “ continuous ” probabilities , but “ semicontinuous ” estimates . the number of “ unique ” probabilities generated by c4.4 and c4.5 cannot be more than the number of leaf nodes . For bagging and random decision trees , the number of unique probabilities
For example ,
Figure 1 . Eight Hour Ozone Alert Prediction cannot be more than the multiple of leaf nodes of all trees in the ensemble . In reality , each tree is correlated in certain degree , the actual number on a given test set is expected to be smaller than this upper bound . In order to compute an exhaustive recall precision plot , we choose the unique probabilities ( as a result of a model tested on the test set ) as the decision thresholds . The results by concatenating 10 folds together are shown in Figures 1 and 2 . For both eight hour and one hour forecast , we present the results in full recall range , between 0.4 and 0.6 where both the recall and precision numbers are useful to cover most alerts with decent number of false alarms , as well as the unique decision thresholds for each decision tree . The scale on precision or y axis is adjusted accordingly to emphasize the difference in results among different models . In

Figure 2 . One Hour Ozone Alert Prediction all four plots , the baseline “ parametric ” model is the “ darkest ” curve . Clearly , the precision obtained by the ensemble approaches ( baggingc45,baggingc44 , rdh , and rdf ) for the same recall numbers are nearly all higher than the baseline parametric approach , and consistently higher in the useful critical recall range of [ 0.4 , 0.6 ] , for both one hour standard and eight hour standard . Importantly , the higher precision obtained by trees are particularly obvious for the newly enacted eight hour long duration standard . As shown in Figure 1 , each of the four ensemble methods has achieved twice as much precision as the parametric model , and single tree method c4.4 has obtained higher precision for recall range [ 04,06 ] The difference among ensemble methods appears to be “ twisted ” and insignificant in the full recall range . In the critical range , rdh and baggingc4.4 appear to have achieved slightly higher precision than the other methods . For the one hour exposure standard , as shown in Figure 2 , in decreasing order of precision for recall range [ 04,06 ] , the top performers are approximately , bagging4.4 , baggingc4.5 , rdh , rdf , followed by the parametric model . In addition , as a summary of each curve in the precision recall curve , we measure the “ coverage ” area or integration under each curve , similar to AUC in ROC , as a single number to compare different models . The normalized area for each modeling technique over the full range is summarized in Table 1 . Since a high coverage implies better performance , the order of performance among different models is in consensus with the visual observation .
As shown in both Figure 1 and 2 , the decision thresholds for the three single tree methods , c4.5prune , c4.5unprune , and c4.4 , all exhibit an s shape , and are either quite high ( close to 1.0 ) or quite low ( close to 00 ) This is due to the fact that single trees tends to construct pure nodes that are mostly ozone days or normal days . It appears that the Laplace correction employed by c4.5 can make the curve “ flatter ” , but it is limited . The decision thresholds of random decision trees are consistently lower than bagging , and this is due to bagging ’s use of information gain to choose feature which results in “ purer ” nodes than random trees .
5.2 Incremental Study
Incremental study is necessary , since in reality , the dataset is not collected all at once , but on a day by day basis . We have chosen three algorithms for this study , baggingc4.4 , random decision tree with half depth , and c4.4 , as they are the best performers for ensemble methods or single trees in the cross validation tests .
Month by Month Exhaustive Test In a month bymonth test , we incrementally include the previous month ’s data to train a new model in order to make predictions for the coming month . We start with the whole year ’s data in 1998 , the incremental tests start on January 1999 , and terminates in December 2004 . For each test ( one hour or eight hour ) , there is a total of 72 of training and test pairs . To compare with cross validation results , we concatenate the estimated probabilities from 72 tests into a single file , choose unique probability values as decision thresholds to plot recall precision curves for recall range [ 04,06 ] and its corresponding coverage measurement , as shown in Figure 3 . Comparing with exhaustive cross validation tests , Figure 1 and 2 , the parametric model ’s performance is very similar but not the same , since it is not tested on the first year ’s data . The performance of baggingc4.5 and rdh is slightly worse than the exhaustive cross validation tests since the training sets are significantly smaller , ie , incrementally from 12 months to 83 months , as compared 10 × 9 = 75.6 months . Howto fixed training data of 84

Figure 3 . Monthly Test Precision Recall Plot and Coverage for Eight hour ( left ) and One hour ( right ) with recall=[04,06 ] ever , they are still significantly better than the parametric model as summarized by the coverage measures in Figure 3 . To be specific , for eight hour test , rdh and baggingc4.4 achieve precision level 10 % to 20 % higher than the parametric model for different recall values . For the one hour test , baggingc4.4 ’s precision is consistently about 5 % higher , but rdh and parametric model are very similar in precision . Compared with the two ensemble approaches , c4.4 ’s performance appears to be significantly worse than the exhaustive test , and consistently worse than the parametric model used by TCEQ . The reason is that single decision tree methods are sensitive to the amount of training data . When the amount is less , single tree ’s error due to variance increment becomes quite large . However , ensemble methods like bagging and rdt can effectively reduce variance even if the training set size is small . This has been recently demonstrated in [ 17 ] .
Annual Test The annual incremental test simulates the realistic scenario that meteorologists would use the probabilistic model . The reason is that the number of ozone days per year for both 1 hr and 8 hr peak is rather skewed and mostly accumulated during the summer months . Incremental learning “ finer ” than one year increment is unlikely to include meaningful number of examples that could otherwise improve the model trained previously . For annual incremental learning , we start by building models from 1998 ’s data to predict on 1999 , incrementally assimilate the previous year ’s data and reconstruct the model to predict on the coming year , till 2004 , for a total of 6 pairs of tests .
Like parametric model , we need to “ fix a decision threshold ” to make prediction on a daily basis . The threshold for the parametric model used by meteorologist is 120 for 1hr peak and 80 for 8 hr peak , and the resulting recall is between 40 % and 60 % . We are interested in estimating a decision threshold for each algorithm to obtain similar levels of recall , and then comparing the resulting precisions ( the higher the better ) . For this reason , 10 fold cross validation is applied on the “ annual ” training set to determine the thresholds used for the next year . Three thresholds are selected for this purpose , and they are the decision thresholds for recall=0.4 , recall=0.6 , and the average of these two thresholds . For example , on December 31 , 2000 , the training data contains 1998 , 1999 and 2000 . In order to decide the decision threshold for the year 2001 , we use 10fold cross validation on the training data of 1998 , 1999 and 2000 . We concatenate all 10 result files generated from cross validation together , and respectively find out the decision threshold for recall to be 0.4 , 0.6 and the average of these two thresholds . This procedure is repeated for each of the three chosen decision tree algorithms , and a different set of decision thresholds is selected for each model . We then use the respective model with the chosen thresholds to predict the year 2001 , and report the corresponding precision and recall . Since the collected data is from 1998 to 2004 , this procedure is repeated 6 times . The results are averaged for 6 years in Table 2 . The “ threshold ” for decision trees is marked under “ 0.40 ” , ” 0.60 ” and “ avg ” . These are not the actual threshold chosen for each method . It just indicates the thresholds chosen from cross validation to obtain recall to be 0.4 , 0.6 and the average of these two thresholds . We bold font a result if both of recall and precision are higher or rather close to the parametric model . The advantages of bagginc4.4 and rdh over the parametric model are obvious . For the eight hour alert , comparing rdh ( recall=0.608 , precision=0.323 ) and parametric ( recall=0.568 and precision = 0.227 ) , assuming that each year has about 25 8 hr ozone alert days , the result means that rdt can correctly detect 1 more day but issue 15 days fewer false alarms .

Table 3 . Ozone Month Annual Test Eight Hour Forecast rologist , this is significant .
Ozone Month Only Annual Test One important observation is that high ozone days only happen during warm days and never occur during winter time . For this reason , it is a reasonable conjecture that those months without any ozone days are unlikely to help to construct a model to detect ozone days for summer months . We design “ an ozone month only annual test’ . The difference from the previously described annual test is that we only use the previous years’ “ ozone month ” data to make predictions for current year ’s ozone month data . We define ozone month as the month which includes at least a day whose ozone level is higher than 80 for 8 hr peak and 120 for 1 hr peak . The total number of months of out 12×7= 84 months has 46 months with 8 hour peak and 33 months with 1 hour peak . When the percentage of ozone days increases or the percentage of positives increases , it becomes a slight different problem . As a result , the decision tree algorithms construct “ conceptually ” different models as compared to previous experiments , and the recall/precision as a function of decision threshold over different models also changes . Using cross validation test , we have found that with recall between 0.7 and 0.8 , the precision by decision trees are still higher than the parametric model for the same year . For this reason , in the ozone month annual test , the decision threshold chosen for the next year are the ones that obtain recall=0.7 , 0.8 , and the average of the two thresholds . The result is shown in Table 3 . It is important to understand that the recall for parametric model ( not the tree model ) is the same as previous annual test , however the precision is slightly higher . This is because the none ozone months have been taken out . In Table 3 , when the decision tree ’s methods achieve both higher recall and higher precision , the results are highlighted in bold fonts . Obviously , for each choice of decision thresholds , both baggingc4.4 and rdt have achieved 10 % to 20 % higher recall with up to 10 % higher precision .
6 Results on Some Other Learners
There are some belief that ozone level is not completely iid from day to day . In other words , the ozone level of previous days in some ways may decide the ozone level of the following days . However , there is no clear consensus as of yet on how this should be modeled effectively . We have experimented a naive approach to take this into account for inductive learning . For each decision tree , instead of using cross validation to estimate the optimal decision threshold for the next year , we find this out somehow “ dynamically ” as follows : set the initial decision threshold as 0.5 , then predict on the first day of the year . If the prediction is correct , keep the threshold and predict on the next day , otherwise adjust the threshold to make the prediction correct . However the mistakes are always counted . Our experiments for both annual and ozone month only annual tests have shown that both recall and precision appear to be less . Another possibility is to include the previous day ’s ozone alert as a feature . However , this will make the trees incompatible with the parametric model . In addition , we also have exper

With the same 10 fold tests used for Figure 1 and 2 , boostedc4.5 achieved recall=0.231 and precision=0.4793 for eight hour , and recall=0.111 and precision=0.293 for one hour . If we had plotted these in the same figures , it could have fallen within curves of the single decision trees . provided a cross validation based procedure and guide on how to choose the most appropriate decision threshold as a compromise between precision and recall , and in the same time , avoid “ surprises ” when applied on biased testing data where neither the feature vector nor the prior class distribution is known .
7 Conclusion
References
Our work provides a data mining based solution to forecast ozone days for the Houston area , that is more accurate ( 20 % higher recall and 10 % higher precision ) than existing method adopted by Texas Commission on Environmental Quality , as well as experiences and methods to solve problems with similar characteristics .
On the practical side , ozone level forecast is one of the most important and difficult problems for air quality control . It is well established that ozone level above certain threshold is dangerous for human health and inadversely affects other parts of our daily life . Traditional approaches to forecast ozone alert relies on “ air dynamics ” that simulates the physical and chemical process that generate ozone . It is well known that these methods consume high computational power and the solution is not portable from one scenario to another . In the same time , the prediction accuracy is still far from being desirable . On the other hand , regression based methods ( regression trees , neural network and parametric regression ) have shown limited success to forecast ozone level . To the best of our knowledge , this paper is the first attempt that use inductive learning technique to issue ozone level alert . Our choice learners are probabilistic decision trees and the base line comparison is a parametric model developed by experts in ozone level prediction . Using seven recent years of data , rather exhaustive cross validation experiments as well as incremental experiments , we have demonstrated that inductive learning can significantly improve an expert based parametric model . In particular , in the annual incremental test , baggingc4.4 and random decision tree can achieve 10 % to 20 % higher recall and up to 10 % higher precision than the parametric model . Though our choice of inductive learners are nonexhaustive , this paper has shown that inductive learning can be a method of choice for ozone level forecast , and ensemble based probability trees provide better forecasts ( higher recall and precision ) than existing approaches .
For data mining research , besides the procedure to analyze and formulate the problem and look for the most appropriate modeling technique , we have shown that in general , model averaging of posterior probability estimators trained from random subset of feature vectors can effectively approximate the true probability when there are 1 ) a lot of irrelevant features and 2 ) feature sample selection bias .
