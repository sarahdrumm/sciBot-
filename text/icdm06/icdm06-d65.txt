1 . Introduction
Recent advances in medical information technology enable us to automatically collect huge amount of temporal data on clinical laboratory examinations . Cross patient analysis of such temporal data has attracted much interests because it might reveal underlying relationships between the time course of examination results and diseases , which might be commonly observed on many patients . However , despite of its importance , large scale analysis of time series medical databases has rarely been performed due to the following problems : ( 1 ) sampling intervals and lengths of data can be both irregular , as they depend on the condition of each patient . ( 2 ) a time series can include various types of events such as acute changes and chronic changes . Additionally , the dimensionality of data can be large as they deal with medical examinations . These fearures prevent us from using conventional time series analysis methods .
This paper presents a novel cluster analysis method for multidimensional time series data on medical laboratory tests . Our method represents time series of test results as trajectories in multidimensional space , and compares their structural similarity by using the multiscale comparison technique [ 1 ] . It enables us to find the part to part correspondences between two trajectories , taking into account the relationships between different tests . The resultant dissimilarity can be further used as input for clustering algorithms for finding the groups of similar cases .

21 Multiscale Description of Trajectories by the
Modified Bessel Function
Let us consider examination data for one person , consisting of I different time series examinations . Let us denote the time series of i th examination by exi(t ) , where i ∈ I . Then the trajectory of examination results , c(t ) is denoted by c(t ) = {ex1(t ) , ex2(t ) , . . . , exI(t)}
Let us also denote an observation scale by σ . Then by using Lindeberg ’s kernel [ 2 ] , a time series of the i th examination at scale σ , EXi(t , σ ) , is derived as follows .
EXi(t , σ ) =
−σIn(σ)exi(t − n ) e
∞ . n=−∞ where In(σ ) denotes the modified Bessel function of order n . Applying the above convolution to all examinations , we obtain the trajectory of examination results at scale σ , C(t , σ ) , as
C(t , σ ) = {EX1(t , σ ) , EX2(t , σ ) , . . . , EXI(t , σ)}
By changing the scale factor σ , we can represent the trajectory of examination results at various observation scales . Figure 1 illustrates an example of multiscale representation of trajectories where I = 2 . Increase of σ induces the

In order to apply the algorithm for closed curve to open trajectory , we modified it to allow replacement of odd number of segments at sequence ends , since cyclic property of a set of inflection points can be lost .
The main procedure of multiscale matching is to search the best set of segment pairs that satisfies both of the following conditions :
1 . Complete Match : By concatenating all segments , the original trajectory must be completely formed without any gaps or overlaps .
2 . Minimal Difference : The sum of segment dissimilari ties over all segment pairs should be minimized .

The search is performed throughout all scales . For ex(0 ) 5 ample , in Figure 1 , three contiguous segments a at the lowest scale of case A can be integrated into one seg(2 ) ment a at upper scale 2 , and the replaced segment well 1 ( 0 ) matches to one segment b 3 of case B at the lowest scale . Thus the set of the three segments a and one seg(0 ) ment b 3 will be considered as a candidate for correspond(0 ) ing segments . On the other hand , segments such as a 6 and b are similar even at the bottom scale without any replacement . Therefore they will be also a candidate for corresponding segments . In this way , if segments exhibit short term similarity , they are matched at a lower scale , and if they present long term similarity , they are matched at a higher scale .

In order to evaluate the structural ( dis )similarity of segments , we first describe the structural feature of a segment by using shape parameters defined below .
22 Segment Hierarchy Trace and Matching
For each trajectory represented by multiscale description , we search for the places of inflection points according to the sign of curvature . Then we divide each trajectory into a set of convex/concave segments , where both ends of a segment correspond to adjacent inflection points . Let A be a trajectory at scale k composed of M ( k ) segments . Then A is represented by A(k ) = {a | i = 1 , 2,··· , M ( k)} , where ( k ) denotes i th segment at scale k . Similarly , Another traa i jectory B at scale h is represented by B(h ) = {b | j = 1 , 2,··· , N ( h)} .

Next , we chase the cross scale correspondence of inflection points from top scales to bottom scale . It defines the hierarchy of segments and enables us to guarantee the connectivity of segments represented at different scales . Details

24 Sequence Dissimilarity
After determining the best set of segment pairs , we newly calculate value based dissimilarity for each pair of matched segments . The local segment dissimilarity defined in the previous section reflects the structural difference of segments , but does not reflect the difference of original sequence values ; therefore , we calculate the value based dissimilarity that can be further used as a metric for proximity in clustering .
Suppose we obtained L pairs of matched segments after multiscale matching of trajectories A and B . The valuebased dissimilarity between A and B , Dval(A , B ) , is defined as follows .

The usefulness of the proposed method was tested on a real medical dataset . We used the chronic hepatitis dataset which was a common dataset in ECML/PKDD discovery challenge 2002 2004 . The dataset contained time series laboratory examination data collected from 771 patients of chronic hepatitis B and C . According to our previous study [ 3 ] , we focused on the analysis of temporal relationships between albumin ( ALB ) and platelet count ( PLT ) , and their relation to fibrotic stages .
The subjects were 488 persons who had valid examination results for all of ALB , PLT and liver biopsy . Constitution of the subjects classified by virus types and administration of interferon ( IFN ) was as follows . Type B : 193 cases , Type C with IFN : 296 cases , Type C without IFN : 99 cases . Due to the limitation of space , we show here the clustering results on Type C without IFN cases .
We performed cluster analysis on ALB PLT trajectories according to the following procedure : ( 1 ) Select a pair of cases ( patients ) and calculate the dissimilarity by using the proposed method . Apply this procedure for all pairs of cases , and construct a dissimilarity matrix . ( 2 ) Create a dendrogram by using conventional hierarchical clustering [ 4 ] and the dissimilarity matrix . ( 3 ) Perform cluster analysis .
Parameters for multiscale matching were empirically determined as follows : starting scale = 0.5 , scale interval = 0,5 , number of scales = 100 , weight for segment replacement cost = 10 We used group average as a linkage criterion for hierarchical clustering .
32 Results
Figure 3 shows the dendrogram generated from the dataset on Type C without IFN cases . The shape of the dendrogram suggested the splitting of data into two or three clusters ; however , in order to carefully examine the data structure , we avoided excessive merge of clusters and determined to split it into 17 clusters where dissimilarity increased relatively large at early stage .

The next column shows the number of cases whose fibrotic stages were F0 or F1 . The subsequent three columns show the number of F2 , F3 , and F4 cases respectively . The rightmost column shows the total number of cases in each cluster .
It could be recognized that the clusters can be roughly classified into one of the two categories : one containing progressed cases of liver fibrosis ( clusters 5 and 7 ) and another containing un progressed cases ( clusters 9 , 11 , 14 , 15 , 16 and 17 ) . This can be confirmed from the dendrogram in Figure 3 , where the two types of clusters appeared at the second devision from the root . This implied that the difference about ALB and PLT might be related to the fibrotic stages .
In order to recognize the detailed characteristics of 8 clusters , we observed the feature of grouped trajectories . Figures 4 7 show the examples of grouped ALB PLT trajec

If the number of cases in a cluster was larger than 16 , the first 16 cases wrt ID number were selected for visualization . The bottom part of Figure 4 provides the legend . The horizontal axis represents ALB value , and the vertical axis represents PLT value . Lower end of the normal range ( ALB:3.9g/dl , PLT:120× 103/ul ) and Upper end of the normal range ( ALB:5.0g/dl , PLT:350 × 103/ul ) were marked with blue and red short lines on each axis respectively . Time phase on each trajectory was represented by color phase : red represents the start of examination , and it changes toward blue as time proceeds .
Figure 4 shows cases grouped into cluster 5 which contained remarkably many F4 cases ( 3/4 ) . The skewed trajectory of ALT and PLT clearly demonstrated that both values

Cluster 7 , shown in Figure 5 , also contained similarly large number of progressed cases ( F4:9/16 , F3:2/16 ) and exhibited the similar characteristics , though it was relatively weaker than in cluster 5 .
On the contrary , clusters that contained many unprogressed cases exhibited different characteristics . Figure 6 shows the trajectories grouped into cluster 17 , where the number of F0/F1 cases was large ( 20/23 ) . Most of the trajectories moved within the normal range , and no clear feature about time direction dependency was observed . Figure 7 ( top ) shows the trajectories in cluster 11 , where all of 7 cases were F0/F1 . They moved within the normal range , but the PLT range was higher than in cluster 17 .
Figure 7 ( bottom ) shows the trajectories in cluster 14 , where trajectories exhibited skewed shapes similarly to cluster 5 . But this cluster consisted of F0/F1 and F2 cases , whereas cluster 5 contained mainly progressed cases . The reason why these cases were separated into different clusters should be investigated further , but it seemed that the difference of progress speed of liver fibrosis , represented as a velocity term , might be a candidate cause .
These results were generated by comparing the valuebased dissimilarity of trajectories , which was measured on the segment pairs determined by multiscale matching . Figure 8 shows two examples of matching results . Matched segments were represented with same color . It can be observed that the structural correspondences were appropriately captured .
The experiments were performed on a small PC cluster consisted of 8 DELL PowerEdge 1750 ( Intel Xeon 2.4GHz 2way ) workstations . It took about three minutes to make the

4 . Discussions
For comparison of medical time series that contain different granularity of events , and whose sampling intervals and lengths are irregular , it is important to appropriately determine the correspondence of data points to be compared . Dynamic Time Warping ( DTW ) [ 5 , 6 ] is a well known method that compares irregular length sequences without any discretization . It makes pairs of the nearest points , one from each sequence , allowing one to many matching . However , the comparison in DTW is based on the local dissimilarity and thus it does not perform structural comparison of the time series . Another well known approach is subsequence clustering [ 7 ] , that compares subsequences of the original sequences generated using a sliding window of the fixed width . However , it is pointed out that the representatives of clusters obtained using this approach do not correctly reflect the common features of sequences [ 8 ] . Frequency domain based approaches [ 9 , 10 ] can also be ap

However , in general they do not recognize the structural features of a sequence , for example , the place of inflection points or local maxima . Hence it is difficult to represent the correspondence between partial sequences and produce value based comparison which can be further used for clustering .
The proposed method employed a two stage approach . Firstly , it compares two trajectories based on their structural similarity , and determines the best correspondence of partial trajectories . After that , it calculates the value based dissimilarity for the all pairs of matched segments , and outputs the total sum as dissimilarity of the two trajectories . This enables us to embed the global difference of original data values into dissimilarity . For example , cases in clusters 17 and 11 took similar courses , but had differences in the average level of PLT values . Such discrimination is difficult with a method that requires the alignment of the data values , for example conventional DTW .
For structural comparison , we used the multiscale matching method that compares two curves at various scales of views . The method is based on scale space filtering [ 11 , 12 ] which has proper features in comparing trajectories ; for example , ( 1 ) it employs curvature , a fundamental feature of planar curves [ 13 ] , and ( 2 ) it preserves monotonicity of the structural changes induced by scale increase [ 14 ] . This multiscale comparison enabled us to find the correspondence of partial trajectories in a close way to human recognition . The results in Figure 8 demonstrate that it could find the correspondence in trajectories that are largely different in detail but similar in gross view .
In our experiments , we observed that the distribution of fibrotic stages was different among the clusters . As each cluster contained trajectories that had similar feature on temporal courses , it may imply the underlying relations between fibrotic stages and trajectories . Although the results should receive evaluation by medical experts , the methodology proposed here would provide a new method for discovering interesting knowledge about temporal course hidden in the medical data .
5 . Conclusions
In this paper , we have presented a multiscale cluster analysis method for temporal medical data that have plural examination items . Application to cluster analysis about ALB PLT trajectories in chronic hepatitis dataset delivered some interesting findings ; for example , there existed some patterns of trajectories that took similar temporal courses , and the clusters well corresponded to the fibrotic stages . These results implied the usefulness of the proposed method as a tool for knowledge discovery in medical data . Our future work include the clinical validation of the results , treatment of the high dimensional data , and refinement of seg ment parameters .
