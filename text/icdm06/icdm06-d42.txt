Abstract(cid:151 ) Narrative reports and criminal records are stored digitally across individual police departments , enabling the collection of this data to compile a nation wide database of criminals and the crimes they committed . The compilation of this data through the last years presents new possibilities of analyzing criminal activity through time . Augmenting the traditional , more socially oriented , approach of behavioral study of these criminals and traditional statistics , data mining methods like clustering and prediction enable police forces to get a clearer picture of criminal careers . This allows of.cers to recognize crucial spots in changing criminal behaviour and deploy resources to prevent these careers from unfolding .
Four important factors play a role in the analysis of criminal careers : crime nature , frequency , duration and severity . We describe a tool that extracts these from the database and creates digital pro.les for all offenders . It compares all individuals on these pro.les by a new distance measure and clusters them accordingly . This method yields a visual clustering of these criminal careers and enables the identi.cation of classes of criminals . The proposed method allows for several user de.ned parameters .
I . INTRODUCTION
The amount of data being produced in modern society is growing at an accelerating pace . New problems and possibilities constantly arise from this so called data explosion . One of the areas where information plays an important role is that of law enforcement . Obviously , the amount of criminal data gives rise to many problems in areas like data storage , data warehousing , data analysis and privacy . Already , numerous technological efforts are underway to gain insights into this information and to extract knowledge from it .
This paper discusses a new tool that attempts to gain insights into the concept of criminal careers : the criminal activities that a single individual exhibits throughout his or her life . The national police annually extracts information from digital narrative reports stored throughout the individual departments and compiles this data into a large and reasonably clean database that contains all criminal records from the last decade . From this database , our tool extracts the four important factors ( see Section II ) in criminal careers and establishes a clear picture on the different existing types of criminal careers by automatic clustering . All four factors need to be taken into account and their relative relations need to be established in order to reach a reliable descriptive image . To this end we propose a way of representing the criminal pro.le of an individual in a single year . We then employ a speci.cally designed distance measure to combine this pro.le with the number of crimes committed and the crime severity , and compare all possible couples of criminals . When this data has been compared throughout the available years we use a human centered clustering tool to represent the outcome to the police analysts . We discuss the dif.culties in career comparison and the speci.c distance measure we designed to cope with this kind of information .
The main contribution of this paper is in Section IV and V , where the criminal pro.les are established and the distance measure is introduced . A prototype test case of this research was described in [ 8 ] .
II . BACKGROUND
The number of data mining projects in the law enforcement area is slowly increasing . Both inside and outside of the academic world large scale projects are underway . One of the larger academic projects is the COPLINK project , a policeuniversity collaboration in Arizona , where work has been done in the exploitation of data mining for cooperation purposes [ 4 ] , the .eld of entity extraction from narrative reports [ 5 ] , and social network analysis [ 6 ] , [ 13 ] . The FLINTS project and FinCEN [ 9 ] aim at revealing links between crimes and criminals and to reveal money laundering networks by comparing .nancial transactions . Also , Oatly et al . [ 11 ] linked burglary cases in the OVER project . Clustering techniques are also widely used in the law enforcement arena , like for example by Adderly and Musgrove [ 1 ] , who applied clustering techniques and Self Organizing Maps to model the behavior of sex offenders , and by Cocx and Kosters [ 7 ] who made an attempt at clustering criminal investigations to reveal what offenses were committed by the same group of criminals .
Our research aims to apply multi dimensional clustering to criminal careers ( rather than crimes or linking perpetrators ) in order to constitute a visual representation of classes of these criminals .
Criminal careers have always been modelled through the observation of speci.c groups of criminals . A more individually oriented approach was suggested by Blumstein et al . [ 2 ] : little de.nitive knowledge had been developed that could be applied to prevent crime or to develop ef.cient policies for reacting to crime until the development of the criminal career paradigm . A criminal career is the characterization of a longitudinal sequence of crimes committed by an individual offender .

Fig 1 . Analysis of Criminal Careers
Participation in criminal activities is obviously restricted to a subset of the population , but by focussing on the subset of citizens who do become offenders , the frequency , seriousness and duration of their careers . We also focus our criminal career information on the nature of such a career and employ data mining techniques to feed this information back to police analysts and criminologists . they looked at
III . APPROACH
Our criminal career analyzer ( see Figure 1 ) is a multiphase process that requires source .les from the National Crime Record Database . From these .les our tool extracts the four factors , mentioned in Section II , and establishes the criminal pro.le per offender . We then compare all individuals in the database and calculate a distance based upon this pro.le , crime severity and number of crimes . This information is summed over time and clustered using a human centered multi dimensional clustering approach . Black boxed , our paradigm reads in the National Crime Database and provides a visual career comparison report to the end user .
First , our tool normalises all careers to ( cid:147)start(cid:148 ) on the same point in time , in order to better compare them . Second , we assign a pro.le to each individual . This is done for each year in the database . After this step , that is described in more detail in Section IV , we compare all possible pairs of offenders on their pro.les for one year , while taking into account that seriousness is inherently linked to certain proles The resulting distance matrix is based upon only two of the four beforementioned criteria , crime nature and severity . We then employ a distance measure described in Section V to fairly incorporate the frequency of delinquent behaviour into our matrix which is then summed over the available years . In the last step we visualize our distance matrix in a 2 dimensional clustering image using the method described in [ 3 ] .
The National Crime Record Database is an up to date source of information and therefore contains the current situation . This does , however , present us with the following problem : it also contains the criminal activities of people that started their career near the end of the database ’s range . Our approach suffers from a lack of information on these offenders and when translated , it could be falsely assumed that their criminal activities terminated ( cid:151 ) however , they have just started . To cope with this problem we draw a semiarbitrary line after two years , which means we dot not take
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 criminals into account that have only been active for two years or less . In a later stage , it is presumably possible to predict in which direction the criminal careers of these offenders will unfold . More information about this prediction can be found in Section VII .
IV . OBTAINING PROFILE DIFFERENCES
In the National Database of Crime Records the crimes of an individual are split up into eight different types , varying from traf.c and .nancial infringements to violent and sex crimes . All these crimes have got an intrinsic seriousness attached to them .
Interpreting these types of crimes and compiling them into a criminal pro.le for individual offenders is done both by determining the percentage of crimes in one year that fall into each one of the categories and dealing with these crimes’ seriousness . The categories are then ordered on severity . Note that while all categories are considered to be different when determining pro.le , their respective severity can be the same . We distinguish three types of crime seriousness : minor crimes , intermediate crimes and severe crimes . Each crime type falls within one of these categories . A typical pro.le of a person looks like the pro.le described in Table I . Summing all the values in a row in the table will result in 1 , representing 100 % of the crimes across the categories .
TABLE I
A TYPICAL CRIMINAL PROFILE
Crime Type Severity Percentage
Traf.c Crimes
Financial Crimes minor 0.0 minor 0.6
. . . . . . . . .
Sex Crimes severe
0.1
Now that we have established a way of representing the crime pro.le of an offender for a single year , it is possible to compare all individuals based upon this information and compile the pro.le distance matrix for each year . It is imperative that we take both the severity and nature of each pro.le into account .
We employ the method described in Table II to accomplish this . Between all couples of offenders we calculate the Pro.le Distance as follows . First we take the absolute difference between the respective percentages in all categories and sum them to gain the difference between these two offenders in crime nature . This number varies between 0 , if the nature of their crimes was exactly the same for the considered year , and 2 where both persons did not commit any crime in the same category . An example of this can be seen in the top panel of Table II , with 0:6 as difference .
One of the problems that arise in this approach is how it should deal with people with no offenses in the considered year . In [ 8 ] , it was assumed that setting all the percentages in the crime nature table to 0 would provide a result that was true to reality . This does not seem to be the case ; such an assumption would provide smaller distances between

Total Pro.le Difference : 0.9 offenders and ( cid:147)innocent(cid:148 ) people , than between different kinds of criminals for an arbitrary year . It would be desirable to assign a maximal distance in crime nature between innocence and guilt . Hence we propose to add to this table the innocence column . An individual without offences in the year under consideration would have a 1 in this .eld , while an actual offender will always have committed 0 % of his or her crimes of the innocent nature . This ensures that the algorithm will assign the desired maximal distance between these different types of persons .
Taking the severity of crimes into account is somewhat more complex . Not only the difference within each severity class needs to be calculated , but also the difference between classes . For example , an offender committing only minor crimes has a less similar career to a severe crime offender , than a perpetrator of the intermediate class would have to the same severe criminal . In compliance with this fact , our approach introduces a weighting factor for the three different categories . Minor offences get a weight of 1 , intermediate crimes get multiplied by 2 and the most extreme cases are multiplied by 3 . Of course , these values are somewhat arbitrary , but the fact that they are linear establishes a reasonably representative and understandable algorithm . This multiplication is done for each individual and is summed over all severity classes before the difference between couples is evaluated . Obviously this will yield a greater distance between a small time criminal and a murderer ( j1 ¢ 1 ¡ 3 ¢ 1j = 2 , which is also the maximum ) than between an intermediate perpetrator and that same killer ( j2 ¢ 1 ¡ 3 ¢ 1j = 1 ) . Naturally , two individuals with the same behavior , still exhibit a distance of 0 . An example of this calculation can be found in the bottom panel of Table II , with value 0:3 .
Naturally , the innocence category in crime nature will be assigned a severity factor of 0 , stating that a minor criminal ( for example : theft ) will be more similar to an innocent person than a murderer would be , when looking at crime severity .
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 Both these concepts will ultimately culminate into the following formula :
4
Fact j ¢ Sev jy j1 A
PD xy = ˆ 9 j Percix ¡ Perciy j! + Xi=1 0 Xj=1 Xj=1 @
Fact j ¢ Sev jx ¡ j
4 where the pro.le distance per year between person x and y is denoted as PD xy , the percentage of person x in crime category a is described as Perc ax , and Sev bx points to the severity class b of person x , with attached multiplication factor Fact b . This formula yields a maximum of 5 ( the maxima of both concepts summed ) and naturally a minimum of 0 . In the example from Table II we would get 0:6 + 0:3 = 0:9 .
As an example of our approach we look at the following situation for an arbitrary year :

First we calculate the difference between all four offenders in both crime nature and crime severity . This provides the following table .

We can now easily calculate the Pro.le Difference between the offenders . The result can be seen in Figure 2 .
We clearly observe from this .gure that the innocent person from our list has a large distance from all offenders , varying from 3 to the bicycle thief to 5 to the murderer . As one would expect , the distances between respectively the thief and the thief murderer and the murderer and the thief murderer are rather small .
The intermediate result we have calculated describes the difference in pro.le and crime seriousness between all individuals in the database . This distance matrix will be used as input for our main distance measure that will add crime frequency to the equation .

V . A NEW DISTANCE MEASURE
The values the PD can get assigned are clearly bounded by 0 and 5 . This is , however , not the case with the crime frequency of the number of crimes per year . This can vary from 0 to an unde.ned but possibly very large number of offences in a single year . To get a controlled range of possible distances between individual careers it is desirable to discretize this range into smaller categories . Intuitively , beyond a certain number of crimes , the difference that one single crime makes is almost insignicant Therefore we propose to divide the number of crimes into categories . These categories will divide the crime frequency space and assign a discrete value FV ( the frequency value ) which will then be used as input for our distance measure . The categories we propose are described in Table V . Using this table the number of crimes value is bounded by 0 and 4 , while the categories maintain an intuitive treatment of both one time offenders and career criminals . Naturally , the absolute difference FVD xy between two individuals x and y also ranges from 0 to 4 .
TABLE V

The sum of PD and FVD seems an obvious choice for a distance measure , but is not suf.cient to fully describe the actual underlying principles . A large part of the National Crime Record Database contains one time offenders . Their respective criminal careers are obviously reasonably similar , although their single crimes may differ largely in category or severity class . However , when looking into the careers of career criminals there are only minor differences to be ob
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 served in crime frequency and therefore the descriptive value of pro.le becomes more important ( cf . [ 2] ) . Consequently , the theoretical dependence of the PD on the crime frequency must become more apparent in our distance measure . To this end we will multiply the pro.le oriented part of our distance measure with the average frequency value and divide it by 4 , to regain our original range between 0 and 5 . Hence , the distance measure that calculates the career difference per year CDPYxy for offenders x and y is as follows :
CDPYxy =
1
4 ( PD xy ¢ 1
2 ( FVx + FVy ) ) + FVD xy
9
:
Dividing by 9 , as is done above , will result in a distance between 0 and 1 for all pairs of offenders , which is standard for a distance matrix . If one of PD xy or FVD xy is 0 , the other establishes the distance ( cid:151 ) as expected . Usage of this distance measure will result in a distance matrix that contains all distances per year for all couples of criminals . The .nal preparation step will consist of calculation of all these matrices for all available years and incorporating the duration of the careers . Now that we have de.ned a measure CDPY ( i ) xy to compare two persons x and y in a particular year i , we can combine this into a measure to compare full ( cid:147)careers(cid:148 ) . The simplest option is to use dist1(x ; y ) =
1 years
CDPY ( i ) xy ; years
Xi=1 where years is the total number of years . This option is further explored in [ 8 ] . The idea can be easily generalized to dist2(x ; y ) = w(i ) CDPY ( i ) xy ; years
Xi=1 where the weights w(i ) must satisfy Pyears i=1 w(i ) = 1 . For instance , the .rst year might have a low weight . Of course , dist1 is retrieved when choosing w(i ) = 1=years for all i .
Two problems arise from this situation . The .rst is that careers may be the same , but ( cid:147)stretched(cid:148 ) . Two criminals can commit the same crimes , in the same order , but in a different time period . This may or may not be viewed as a different career . On the one hand it is only the order of the crimes that counts , on the other hand the time in between also matters . The second is that if a criminal does not commit a crime in a given year , the distance to others ( for that year ) will be in some sense different from that between two active criminals . In order to address these remarks , we propose a stretch factor –S , with –S ‚ 0 . This factor can be set or changed by the career analyst if he or she feels that the provided result does not fully represent reality . If –S = 0 we retrieve the original measure , if –S is high many years can be contracted into a single one . To formally de.ne our measure , we look at two careers , where for simplicity we use capitals A , B , C , . . . to indicate different crime types , and use multiset notation to specify the crimes in each year ( so , eg , fA ; A ; Bg refers to a year where two A crimes and one B crime were committed ) .
Suppose we have the following 7 year careers x and y of two criminals : x = ( fA ; A ; Bg ; fCg ; fAg ; fBg ; fDg ; ; ; ; ) ; y = ( fA ; Bg ; ; ; fDg ; ; ; fAg ; fB ; Dg ; ; ) :
The second career may be viewed as a somewhat stretched version of the .rst one , The differences are : x has two As in the .rst year , whereas y has only one ; x has the singleton set fCg in year 2 , whereas y has fDg in year 3 ; and year 6 from y is spread among year 4 and 5 of x . Evidently we are looking for some sort of edit distance .
Now we take –S 2 f0 ; 1 ; 2 ; : : :g and collapse at most –S years , for both careers , where we add ;s to the right . Note that , when collapsing two sets , it is important to decide whether or not to use multisets . For instance , with –S = 2 , we might change y to y0 = ( fA ; Bg ; fDg ; ; ; fA ; B ; Dg ; ; ; ; ; ; ) :
If we have t years , there are t +(cid:181)t ¡ 1
2 ¶ + : : : +(cid:181)t ¡ 1 –S ¶ ways to change a single career ; by the way , many of them give the same result . For the above example , with t = 7 and –S = 2 , this gives 22 possibilities , and therefore 22£22 = 484 possible combinations of the two careers . We now take the smallest distance between two of these as the .nal distance . For the example this would be realized through x0 = ( fA ; A ; Bg ; fCg ; fAg ; fB ; Dg ; ; ; ; ; ; ) ; y00 = ( fA ; Bg ; fDg ; fAg ; fB ; Dg ; ; ; ; ; ; ) :
So .nally the distance of x and y is determined by the distance between the singleton sets fCg and fDg , and the way how the multiset fA ; A ; Bg compares to fA ; Bg . This last issue can be easily solved in the basic computation of PD , discussed in Section IV .
Of course , there are other practical considerations . For instance , some ( perhaps even many ) crimes will go unnoticed by police forces , giving an incorrect view . Furthermore , in the current approach there is a clear , but maybe unwanted separation between crimes committed in December and in January of the next year .
VI . CLUSTERING METHOD AND VISUALIZATION
The standard construction of our distance matrix enabled our tool to employ existing techniques to create a 2 dimensional clustering image . The intermediate Euclidean distances in this image correspond as good as possible to the distances in the original matrix . Earlier research [ 7 ] showed that automated clustering methods with human intervention might get promising results . The method that we incorporated in our tool was described by Broekens et al . [ 3 ] , who built upon the push and pull architecture described in [ 10 ] , and allows data analysts to correct small mistakes made by naive clustering algorithms that result in local optima . The user is
Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM'06)0 7695 2701 9/06 $20.00 © 2006 assisted by coloring of the nodes that represent how much a single individual or a collection of individuals contribute to the total error made in the current clustering . The end result is a clickable 2 dimensional image of all possible careers . When the user clicks on an individual he or she is presented with the pro.le information for that particular offender .
VII . PREDICTION
It is very well possible to use the above mentioned method for prediction . Though we have not experimented with this yet , we would like to briefiy mention some possibilities and problems .
Once a ( large ) group of criminals has been analyzed , it is possible to predict future behavior of new individuals . To this end we can readily use the tool from [ 3 ] . Suppose that the given database has already been converted into a 2dimensional clustering diagram , as described in Section VI . We can and will assume that the original database consists of ( cid:147)full(cid:148 ) careers . For a new partially .lled career , eg , consisting of only two consecutive years with crimes , we can compute its distance to all original ones taking into account only the number of years of the new career . The system now takes care of .nding the right spot for this individual , where it reaches a local minimum for the distances in the 2 dimensional space in comparison with the computed distances . The neighbouring individuals will then provide some information on the possible future behavior of the newly added career ; this information is of a statistical nature .
Of course , in practice it is not always clear when a career ends , not to speak of situations where a career ends or seems to end prematurely , eg , because a criminal dies or is in prison for a substantial time period .
VIII . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We tested our tool on the actual Dutch National Criminal Record Database . This database contains approximately one million offenders and the crimes they committed . Our tool analyzed the entire set of criminals and presented the user with a clear 2 dimensional clustering of criminal careers as can be seen in Figure 3 . The con.dential nature of the data used for criminal career analysis prevents us from disclosing more detailed experimental results reached in our research .
The image in Figure 3 gives an impression of the output produced by our tool when analyzing the beforementioned database . This image shows what identi.cation could easily be coupled to the appearing clusters after examination of its members . It appears to be describing reality very well . The large ( cid:147)cloud(cid:148 ) in the left middle of the image contains ( most of the ) one time offenders . This seems to relate to the database very well since approximately 75 % of the people it contains has only one felony or misdemeanour on his or her record . The other apparent clusters also represent clear subsets of offenders . There is however a reasonably large group of ( cid:147)un clustered individuals(cid:148 ) . The clustering of these individual criminal careers might be infiuenced by the large cluster of one timers . Getting more insights into the possible existence of
Minor career criminals
Severe career criminals
Multiple crimes per offender , varying in other categories
One time offenders
Fig 3 . Clustering of Criminal Careers subgroups in this non cluster may prove even more interesting than the results currently provided by our approach . Future research will focus on getting this improvement realized ( cf . Section IX ) .
IX . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this paper we demonstrated the applicability of data mining in the .eld of criminal career analysis . The tool we described compiled a criminal pro.le out of the four important factors describing a criminal career for each individual offender : frequency , seriousness , duration and nature . These pro.les were compared on similarity for all possible pairs of criminals using a new comparison method . We developed a speci.c distance measure to combine this pro.le difference with crime frequency and the change of criminal behavior over time to create a distance matrix that describes the amount of variation in criminal careers between all couples of perpetrators . This distance measure incorporates intuitive peculiarities about criminal careers . The end report consists of a visual 2 dimensional clustering of the results and is ready to be used by police experts .
The enormous ( cid:147)cloud(cid:148 ) of one time offenders gave a somewhat unclear situational sketch of our distance space . This problem , however , can not be easily addressed since a large part of the National Criminal Record Database simply consists of this type of offenders . Its existence shows , however , that our approach easily creates an identi.able cluster of this special type of criminal career , which is promising . One possible solution to this problem would be to simply not take these individuals into account when compiling our distance matrices . The used method of clustering provided results that seem to represent reality well , and are clearly usable by police analysts , especially when the above is taken into account . However , the runtime of the chosen approach was not optimal yet . The clustering method was too intensive in a computational way , causing delays in the performance of the tool . In the future , an approach like Progressive Multi Dimensional Scaling [ 12 ]

Future research will aim at solving both concerns mentioned above . After these issues have been properly addressed , research will mainly focus on the automatic comparison between the results provided by our tool and the results social studies reached on the same subject , in the hope that ( cid:147)the best of both worlds(cid:148 ) will reach even better analyzing possibilities for the police experts in the eld Incorporation of this tool in a data mining framework for automatic police analysis of their data sources is also a future topic of interest .
