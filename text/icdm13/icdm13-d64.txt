Abstract—Dynamic networks are structures with objects and links between the objects that vary in time . Temporal information in dynamic networks can be used to reveal many important phenomena such as bursts of activities in social networks and human communication patterns in email networks . In this area , one very important problem is to understand dynamic patterns of object roles . For instance , will a user become a peripheral node in a social network ? Could a website become a hub on the Internet ? Will a gene be highly expressed in gene gene interaction networks in the later stage of a cancer ? In this paper , we propose a novel approach that identifies the role of each object , tracks the changes of object roles over time , and predicts the evolving patterns of the object roles in dynamic networks . In particular , a probability model is proposed to extract latent features of object roles from dynamic networks . The extracted latent features are discriminative in learning object roles and are capable of characterizing network structures . The probability model is then extended to learn the dynamic patterns and make predictions on object roles . We assess our method on two data sets on the tasks of exploring how users’ importance and political interests evolve as time progresses on dynamic networks . Overall , the extensive experimental evaluations confirm the effectiveness of our approach for identifying , analyzing and predicting object roles on dynamic networks .

INTRODUCTION
Dynamic networks exist in many different settings , such as computer networks , social networks , biological networks and sensor networks . During the formation and the dynamics of these systems , objects usually play various types of changing roles . For example , in Facebook , some users play as topic hubs which are highly involved in various activities while some other users play as peripheral objects who seldom participate in discussions . As time goes by , highly involved users may reduce their engagement with Facebook due to the increased engagement with other social networks , and peripheral users may become more active in the communities .
In the research of dynamic networks , a critical problem is to understand object roles and their evolving patterns . This problem is meaningful in many applications and has attracted much attention . For instance , detecting users having abnormal roles can be used to filter spammers in email networks , analyzing the dynamics of customer engagement in social networks can help improve the quality of service , and predicting the informative genes in gene gene interaction networks is essential for preventing the onset of cancers .
Nevertheless , existing methods for this problem usually focus on static networks and make strong assumptions on the relationships between specific topological properties and the types of object roles of interest . [ 1 ] defines vulnerable nodes as the nodes that the deletion of them could cause maximum network fragmentation . [ 2 ] assumes important objects should have high PageRank scores . Generally , there are two drawbacks of such methods . First , the topological properties in each task are subjectively selected , thus critical information characterizing the object roles in the networks may be missed . Even worse , when object roles are complex , the aforementioned strategy may not be able to characterize the object roles using any existing topological property . Second , existing methods specified for static networks ignore the influence of the evolving vertices and links in dynamic networks , thus are not applicable for analyzing the dynamic patterns of object roles . To sum up , these existing methods are not effective in mining the object roles and their evolving patterns in dynamic networks .
In this paper , we propose a novel probability model to address the problems of learning , analyzing and predicting object roles in dynamic networks . Different from the aforementioned existing methods , the proposed model does not rely on any subjectively selected topological properties , and is capable of characterizing network dynamics . At the heart of our framework is the latent feature representation of object roles , which captures the structural information of each time point , incorporates evolving information in dynamic networks , and is discriminative in learning object roles . Specifically , at each time point , objects of similar roles have close latent feature representations , and the interactions of the latent object roles can effectively reconstruct the observable network of the time point . Moreover , the extracted latent feature representation can well fit the existing supervised information in the proposed model . Furthermore , to incorporate the evolving information in the dynamic networks , the latent feature representation of each time point is close to the prediction obtained from the previous time points . This representation of object roles can be used to build a variety of sophisticated analysis tools for dynamic networks . We utilize the effective representation strategy for exploring the evolution of object roles . This representation method endues the proposed approach with simple and direct visualizations that clearly show how the roles of individual objects evolve as time progresses .
Although mining dynamic networks using latent feature representation on objects has been a hot topic recently , the proposed work in this paper significantly differs from the existing work in both the method and the aimed task . In the existing methods , exponential family random graph models ( ERGMs ) are the canonical way for representing observable networks with latent variables . As discussed in [ 3 ] , ERGMs usually

428 suffer from high computational and statistical cost thus hardly work in practice . To avoid the drawbacks of ERGMs , several alternative approaches [ 4]–[6 ] have been proposed in recent years to use latent feature vectors as ” coordinates ” to represent the characteristics of each node . Compared with the proposed probability model in this paper , these ” coordinates ” methods always assume that highly connected objects have close latent feature representations and vice versa . Since objects of the same roles are not necessarily highly connected or may be even far away from each other , these existing methods can not encode object roles as latent feature representations in many applications and are not effective in the learning of object roles in dynamic networks .
The proposed approach is built upon two bases : first , object roles can be extracted from structural information ; and second , object roles should change gradually rather than abruptly . The second base means that previous data can provide hints about the current status of the network , and this assumption has been widely used in dynamic network mining such as [ 4]– [ 6 ] . In experiments , we investigate how people ’s importance and political interests evolve in dynamic networks . The results well support these two bases .
Overall , the contributions of this work include : • In Section II B , a Gaussian model is proposed to effectively extract latent features of object roles for both supervised and unsupervised cases . A solution based on variational Bayesian inference is then provided to efficiently optimize the proposed model . • In Section II C , we extend the Gaussian model to incorporate dynamic information for learning and analyzing object roles in dynamic networks . • In Section II D , we also provide the details of implementing the proposed model for predicting object roles according to the learned evolving patterns . • In Section III , we experimentally evaluate the proposed methods on the tasks of mining people ’s evolving importance and political interests in dynamic networks . The overall performance well confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model .
II . METHODOLOGY
In this section , we present the details of the proposed LAP ( Learning , Analyzing and Predicting ) model for mining object roles on dynamic networks . Specifically , we start from detecting object roles on static networks , then extend the developed model to dynamic cases . The prediction of object roles is achieved through the extended model .

An×m represents that the matrix A contains n rows and m columns . Besides , Ai , : and A:,j represent the i th row and the j th column of the matrix A , respectively , and Aij is the element at the i th row and the j th column .

Besides , a Gaussian distribution of A with mean B and variance σ2 is denoted as N ( A|B , σ2 ) . We summarize the major variable matrices used in this paper in Table I . Each dynamic network is assumed to be periodically sampled into t snapshots , and denoted as G = {Gi|i ∈ [ 1 , t]} . Gi = {V i } is the i th snapshot , where V i is the set of ni vertices , and Ei is the set of links between the vertices . In our context , each vertex is an object . In the dynamic network G , we suppose there are c object role classes , and the label matrix for the objects in Gi is Y i ni×c . In the paper , we suppose labels of objects are provided in the first snapshot , and focus on the following three tasks : ni×1 , Ei ni×ni dynamic network ;
• Learning the role of each object at each snapshot of the • Analyzing how object roles evolve over time ; and • Predicting the object roles at the ( t + 1) th snapshot of the dynamic network using the first to the t th snapshots .
B . Detection on Static Networks
In this section , we propose a probability model for object role detection on static networks , as a ground for the dynamic object role analysis .
Different from the existing methods [ 4]–[6 ] that view object roles as object ” coordinates ” , we interpret the role of each object as its properties that determine to what extent and how the object impacts the other objects in the formation and the dynamics of the network .
To better explain the intuition of this definition and its difference from the ” coordinates ” concept , we give an example on the trade history of the ancient Tamil country [ 7 ] which is a region in southern India . During the ancient time , people there were frequently involved in both local and international , and both inland and overseas trade . We conclude the rules of the trade as follows .
1 ) The closer two objects were , the more likely they could trade/interact . In the Ancient Tamil , most trade was by barter , which was prevalent locally . As a result , more trades were performed locally than internationally .
2 ) Objects with larger activity range had higher ability to interact with other objects . As an evidence , the development of seamanship and the discovery of new routes significantly increased the trades between Tamil and Rome . 3 ) The properties of two objects determined how they interacted . For instance , on the trades between Tamil and
429
Rome , according to the different goods they could produce , Tamil exported pepper , ivory and gold , and imported glass , coral and wine . Another example is that the changes of the Emperor of Rome had significant impact on the trade between Tamil and Rome .
In a network representation of the trades of the Ancient Tamil , each node denotes an object that participated in the trade , and each link represents a trade ; whether there is a link between any two objects is determined by the rule 1 and the rule 2 ; and the weights of the links , which represent the interaction types of the objects , are determined by the rule 3 .
In this process , there are two factors impacting the formation of the network : object coordinates and object roles . The coordinates of objects , covering rule 1 , determine the closeness of each two objects . The roles of objects , covering rule 2 and rule 3 , determine to what extent and how each object impacts the others . The objective of this paper is to explore how to detect , analyze and predict such object roles .
The Unsupervised Model on Learning Object Roles
Suppose object coordinates are a dimensional and object roles are r dimensional . Let Ξn×a and Λn×r be the latent coordinate matrix and latent role matrix for n objects , respectively . An observed link Eij from a source object i to a target object j is generated as :
Eij = Λi , : · M→ · Λj , : · M← · K(Ξi, : , Ξj, : ) + .
In the above equation , M→ measures how the role Λi , : of the source object i impacts the link Eij ; and similarly , M← measures how the role Λj , : of the target object j impacts the link Eij . K(Ξi, : , Ξj, : ) is a closeness function measuring how close two objects ( object i and object j ) are . The larger K(Ξi, : , Ξj, : ) is , the more likely two objects i and j interact . During the past few years , extensive work has been done to estimate the latent closeness of two objects in networks . In this paper , we use the truncated Katz kernel [ 8 ] for this purpose . By this kernel , the closeness matrix K on a network E is K =
. i=1 αi · Ei , and K(Ξi, : , Ξj, : ) = Kij . r is fi
If we assume each Eij independently generated from a Gaussian distribution with mean Λi , : · M→ · Λj , : · M← · Kij and noise variance σ2 , the conditional distribufi tion of the observed link matrix E is : p(E|Λ , H , σ2 ) = ' ◦ K)ij , σ2 ) , in which H = M→ · j=1 N ( Eij|(ΛHΛ M← is the object interaction matrix measuring how each object contributes to each link . n i=1 n
Suppose the priors of the latent feature matrix Λ of the ' − . object roles and the object interaction matrix H follow the spherical Gaussian distributions and they are column wise ' ff − . independent , we have : p(Λ ) ∝ exp = ff , and p(H ) ∝ exp exp .

( 1 )
By the model in Eq 1 , we can extract the latent feature representation Λ of object roles as well as the role interaction matrix H from an observable link matrix E of a static network .
The Supervised Model on Learning Object Roles
In our experiment setting , we assume at the first time point , there are several labeled objects to guide the learning of each type of object roles and to maximize the margins between different object roles .
For the first snapshot , the label matrix for the labeled objects is ˆYm×c , in which m is the number of the labeled objects . To extend the unsupervised model for supervised cases , we introduce a feature coefficient matrix Wr×c which measures the contribution of each feature in Λ to the object role classes : m c

For the supervised cases , the posterior is : p(E|Λ , H)p( ˆY |Λ , W )p(Λ)p(H)p(W ) p(Λ , H , W|E , ˆY ) = p(E , ˆY )
. ( 3 ) Given E and ˆY , by maximizing Eq 3 , we are able to obtain the latent feature presentation Λ of object roles , the interaction matrix H and the coefficient matrix W for learning object role classes on Λ .
Solution of the Supervised Model
1 ) Variational Bayesian Inference : In this part , we apply the Variational Bayesian technique [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] to maximize Eq 3 . Suppose there is a trial distribution on the matrices Λ , H and W as Q(Λ , H , W ) which has the constraint Q(Λ , H , W )dΛdHdW = 1 . The free energy of the system is : F = EQ(Λ,H,W )[log p(E , ˆY , Λ , H , W ) − log Q(Λ , H , W ) ] , ( 4 ) which can be further formulated into :
F =EQ(Λ,H,W )[log p(Λ , H , W|E , ˆY ) + log p(E , ˆY )
= log p(E , ˆY ) − KL(Q(Λ , H , W )p(Λ , H , W|E , ˆY ) )
− log Q(Λ , H , W ) ]
≤ log p(E , ˆY ) .
( 5 ) where ρ is a constant which is irrelevant to Λ . δ( ˆY , i ) is the indicator function that equals 1 if the labeled set includes object i and equals 0 otherwise .
Comparing with Eq 6 , the derivation leads to the following

In Eq 5 , Eq(f ( x ) ) denotes the expectation of the role f ( x ) with respect to a distribution q(x ) . KL(qp ) = p(x ) dx represents the Kullback Leibler ( KL ) divergence of a distribution p with regards to q . Since the value of a KL divergence is always non negative , in the end of the above formulation , we can conclude that the lower bound for the evidence log p(E , ˆY ) is F . Through maximizing the free energy F , we can obtain the optimum if and only if Q(Λ , H , W ) = p(Λ , H , W|E , ˆY ) . It is usually intractable to approximate Q(Λ , H , W ) due to the complexity caused by the high dimensionality of the interacted members Λ , H and W . Therefore , we apply the variational approximation Q(Λ , H , W ) = Q(Λ)Q(H)Q(W ) .
By the variational Bayesian framework , the variational posteriors of the matrices Λ , H and W can be iteratively updated through the following rules :
' ' '

( 6 )
Q(Λ)dΛ = 1 ,
Q(H)dH = 1 and where zΛ , zH and zW are constants which enforce the conditions Q(W )dW = 1 . In the iterative solution , the conditional probability over the observed link p(E|Λ , H ) will introduce a term ΛHΛ ' which includes the quadratic multiplications of H and the quartic integrations of Λ . This term may cause high time and space complexities . Therefore , in each iteration , we utilize the ∗ optimized in the last iteration as : Λ

To verify the correctness of this simplification is to prove that the optimal Λ and H obtained by this simplification can also satisfy the optimization of the original conditional probability . The proving process is straightforward . Due to the limited pages of this paper , we skip the details here . Plugging in the model for p(Λ , H , W|E , ˆY ) , we can com pute the variational posterior Q(Λ ) by :

C . Detection and Analysis on Dynamic Networks
In this section , we extend the above probabilistic model for detecting and analyzing object roles on dynamic networks .
Let Ei denote the observed link matrix at the i th sampled time point . Suppose we have a sequence of such sampled link matrices {E1 , E2 , , Et} , our goal of analyzing network dynamics is to obtain a sequence of low rank matrices {{Λ1 , H 1},{Λ2 , H 2} , ,{Λt , H t}} . The i th pair {Λi , H i} , which approximates Ei , captures the role of each object at the i th time point and the interaction patterns of these object roles .
The Object Role Model for Dynamic Networks
Let Di = {Λi , H i} denote the pair of the low rank matrices we wish to extract at the i th time point . We present the graphic model of our analyzing framework in Fig 1 . The observed network Ei at the i th snapshot is generated by the latent parameters Di , and Di is determined by three factors : the previous latent parameters D1:i−1 ( D1 to Di−1 ) , the current object roles Λi and the current object interaction pattern H i . In the first snapshot , no previous latent parameters D1:i−1 exist . The object roles in E1 can be effectively extracted through the models proposed in Section II B . In this paper , we assume that labeled information exists in the first snapshot , therefore we use the supervised model in Section II B . At each snapshot i for i ∈ [ 2 , t ] , Di−1 has already been calculated and Ei is observable . With the assumption that D1:i−1 and Ei are independent , the posterior distribution of on the parameter set Di is : p(Di|D
1:i−1
, Ei ) = p(Di|D
1:i−1
)p(Di|Ei ) .
Since p(Ei|Di ) ≡ p(Ei|Λi , H i ) , p(Ei|Di ) can be well approximated by Eq 7 . The only thing remaining unsolved is how to estimate p(Di|D1:i−1 ) ≡ p(Λi , H i|Λ1:i−1 , H 1:i−1 ) .
We place Gaussian priors on Λi and H i as : p(Λi|Ωi

When i = 2 , since we only have Λ1 and no change of Λ has been observed , the best prediction of Ω2 Λ is Λ1 . For i ≥ 3 , we can approximate Ωi Λ through the MAR(1 ) ( Multivariate Autoregressive ) model [ 11 ] as : Λi = Λi−1 · AΛ + i Λ ,
( 21 ) where i is a Gaussian noise having zero mean and precision Σi Λ . Suppose X i Λ = [ Λ2 , Λ3 , , Λi−1 ] , by maximum likelihood estimation , we have :

Detection and Analysis on Object Role Classes To make the final decision on the role label of each node , we estimate p(Fj|Vi ) , which is the conditional probability that object Vi belongs to the role class Fj , through the estimation : ( 34 ) p(Fj|Vi ) = Ep(Λ),p(W )Λi,:W:,j = Λi,:W :,j .
By Eq 34 , we can obtain the probability of each object belonging to each object role class at each time point . For the detection of object roles , each object is then assigned to the class in which the object has the highest probability . For the analysis of object roles , the trend of varying p(Fj|Vi ) over different time points clearly reveals the dynamic patterns of object roles . We explain more about how to use p(Fj|Vi ) in the analysis of dynamic object roles in Section III A3 .
D . Prediction on Dynamic Networks
Based on the aforementioned object role detections and analysis model , in this section , we develop the approach for predicting object roles on dynamic networks .
Suppose there are t + 1 periodically sampled snapshots of a dynamic network , and among them , the first t snapshot networks are observable . We predict the object roles at t + 1 based on the observable data by maximizing the posterior probability below : p(Λt+1|E p(Λt+1|Λt)p(Λt|E
1:t ) =
1:t ) .

By sequential inference , we can predict the object roles in
Since E1:t are all observable and Λt has already been extracted , by maximizing the logarithm of the above posterior probability , we obtain Λt+1 = Λt · AΛ . fi j=1 Λt · AΛ . |V t+s
With the predicted Λt+s , the object role probability in the ( t + s) th snapshot is estimated as p(F t+s i , : W:,j . We can then obtain the role of each object following the method at the end of Section II C . .

III . EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS
In this part , we experimentally evaluate the proposed LAP algorithm on two real data sets : SocialEvolution [ 12 ] and RobotNet The SocialEvolution data set is available upon request1 and the Robot.Net data set is publicly available2 .
The experiments include three parts . On each data set , we first evaluate the performance of LAP on the task of detecting object role classes at each time point . Case studies are then performed to evaluate the correctness of the extracted dynamic patterns of object roles . To the end , we test the performance of the proposed LAP algorithm on the task of object role predictions . In the experiments , baselines are investigated to quantitatively prove the superiority of the proposed LAP algorithm .
A . Experiments on SocialEvolution Data Set
1 ) Dataset Description : We first evaluate LAP on the SocialEvolution data set to demonstrate its capabilities in analyzing the evolving patterns of people ’s political interests in dynamic networks . This data set was collected from October 2008 to May 2009 , and it contains information of locations , phone calls , music sharing logs , surveys on relationships , political interests and etc In the experiments , we build the dynamic networks of the SocialEvolution data set as : initially the weights of links between the objects ( people in the data set ) are set to 0 which stands for no link . If there is a phone call , message or music share between two users at a time point , we add the weight of the undirected link between the two users by 1 for that time point . The constructed continuous dynamic network is then divided into 5 snapshots which are denoted as E1 to E5 , respectively .
In this data set , surveys of some users’ political interests at different time points have also been provided . According to the surveys on whether people are interested in politics , we divide the users into three classes : Indifferent , Moderate and Enthusiastic . In the experiments , we suppose the surveys at the first time point are known and use them in the training . The surveys at the other time points are then used to numerically evaluate the performance .
2 ) Object Role Detection : In this part , we investigate the performance of the proposed LAP algorithm on the task of identifying object roles at each time point . For comparisons , we also consider four baselines in this experiment as follows . As discussed in Section I , subjectively selected structural properties are usually insufficient to cover the characteristics

' n i=1 fi fi j=1 N ( Kij|(ΛHΛ
As explained in Section II B , we assume that object roles describe how and to what extent could the objects impact the others . In the contrast , existing methods such as [ 4]–[6 ] view object roles as the ” coordinates ” of the objects , and they assume objects of the same roles are highly connected . To measure the impact of these two different assumptions , we build a baseline named as Coordinates which is identical to the proposed LAP model except that it defines p(E|Λ , H , σ2 ) as : p(E|Λ , H , σ2 ) = )ij , σ2 ) . By this modification , highly connected objects tend to obtain close latent feature representations in the results . In the proposed LAP model , we predict the object roles at time t base on the object roles at time 1 to time t − 1 . The major idea of the proposed model in utilizing the evolving information is that the extracted object roles at time t should be close to this prediction . However , in most existing methods such as [ 6 ] , the extracted object roles at time t are assumed to be close to the object roles at time t − 1 . To measure the impact of these two different assumptions , we build a baseline named as Prior which is identical to the proposed LAP model except that it defines p(Di|Di−1 ) as : p(Di|Di−1 ) ff p(Λi|Λi−1 , CΛi−1 )p(H i|H i−1 , CH i−1 ) . By this modification , object roles at time t tend to be close to the learned object roles at time t − 1 .
For each investigated method , we test its performance on the known labeled data with varying parameter values so as to find the best parameter setting . In our model , we obtain that the optimal number of latent features is 63 .
Since the numbers of objects in different classes are highly imbalanced , accuracy is not meaningful in evaluating the performance . Therefore , we calculate the Receiver Operating Characteristics ( ROC ) curve and use the Area Under the Curve ( AUC ) to capture the quality of the ROC curve .
Table II summarizes the performance of all the investigated methods on the SocialEvolution data set .
We first notice that PageRank and Centrality generally do not perform well on detecting all the three object roles over different time points , and in some cases the AUC scores are even close to random guess . This bad performance indicates that PageRank and Centrality are not able to capture sufficient information from the structure to characterize the object roles . For the third baseline Coordinates , the performance varies significantly over different cases . On E1 , since labeled information for each object role is provided , Coordinates can reach very high AUC scores . On E2 which is close to E1 , the
434 performance is still good with the guidance of trained object roles at E1 . As time progresses , the guidance of the labeled information at E1 becomes weak , thus the performance of Coordinates is very bad from E3 to E5 . The bad performance on E3 to E5 indicates that Coordinates can not characterize the object roles well without the guidance of labeled information . This result supports that labeled information is critical for extracting discriminant representations of object roles , and that viewing object roles as ” Coordinates ” does not work in these cases .
An interesting finding in this experiment is that the fourth baseline Prior performs significantly worse than the proposed method LAP on detecting the Indifferent and Enthusiastic objects while achieving close performance on Moderate objects . To seek the reason for this result , we analyze the data and observe that the probabilities of Indifferent , Moderate and Enthusiastic objects changing their levels of interests in politics are on average 24.63 % , 11.17 % and 23.61 % , respectively . This observation indicates that Moderate objects are more consistent in political interests while Indifferent and Enthusiastic objects are more likely to change . Since Prior assumes the object roles are close to previous object roles , it performs better on Moderate objects that change less and performs worse on Indifferent and Enthusiastic objects that change more .
Comparing with all these baseline methods , LAP achieves the best performance on almost all the experiments . Compared with the best baseline Prior , LAP improves the AUC scores by up to 61.14 % and on average 1375 % To better illustrate the advantage of the proposed LAP model , in Fig 2 , we show the ROC curves on detecting Indifferent objects ( due to the space limit , we only show this case ) . c i t s a i s u h t n E c i t s a i s u h t n E

3 ) Object Role Analysis : In this section , we do case studies to demonstrate how we implement the proposed model to analyze changing patterns of object roles . Without loss of generality , we use 0 , 1 and 2 to represent the classes of Indifferent , Moderate and Enthusiastic , respectively . With the class probabilities learned by the proposed LAP model , we calculate the class number expectation of each object at each time point . We view the class numbers as angles , scale them to the range of [ 0 , π ] , and demonstrate the dynamic patterns in compasses as in Fig 3 and Fig 4 .
In Fig 3 , we show the changing pattern of object 42 . According to the surveys on political interests , this person appeared to be highly interested in politics in the first three time points which are around the date of the US presidential election at 2008 . During the last two time points , this person was less interested in politics and had doubts about the president and the congress . In Fig 3 , the learned object roles of this person well reflect the dynamics of his/her interest in politics .
In Fig 4 , we show the changing pattern of object 70 . Similar to the object 42 , this person appeared to be more interested in politics during the first three time points than the rest snapshots . This person claimed himself/herself as slightly interested in politics around the presidential election date and frequently switched his/her preferred party between the Independent and the Democrat . During the last two time points , this person showed no interest in politics at all and expressed nothing about the president , the congress or the economy policies . In Fig 4 , the learned object roles well reflect the dynamics of his/her interest in politics .
Due to space limit , we only show the two cases in this section . The excellent performance supports that the proposed LAP model is effective in analyzing and visualizing the dynamics of object roles .
4 ) Object Role Prediction : In this section , we investigate the performance of LAP on the task of predicting object roles . For comparison , we extend the baselines in Section III A2 to this task . Specifically , we utilize the results of PageRank and Centrality in autoregressive model for prediction , and obtain two baselines DyPageRank and DyCentrality , respectively . Since the other two baselines Coordinates and Prior are dynamic model , they can be directly used in the task of object role prediction .
In this experiment , we predict the second to the fifth time points using the previous data . The the object roles at

We first notice that the prediction performance of DyPageRank and DyCentrality is very close to the detection performance of PageRank and Centrality in Table II . This fact indicates that DyPageRank and DyCentrality are very effective in learning the evolving patterns of the PageRank and Centrality scores . Nevertheless , these two baselines perform the worst among all the investigated methods on the task of object role predictions . The bad performance verifies the fact that PageRank and Centrality scores can not well capture the characteristics of the object roles considered in this experiment . As for Coordinates , it shows better performance in prediction than in detection . Notice that for object role detection , Coordinates integrates two kinds of information : the prediction based on previously learned object roles and the extraction based on the current network . In contrast , in prediction , it only uses the previously learned object roles . Therefore , the extraction part , in which object roles are viewed as object ” Coordinates ” , reduces the overall performance of the detection . This experiment again prove that viewing object roles as ” Coordinates ” is not effective in learning , analyzing and predicting object roles .
Similar to the results in Table II , in Table III , Prior achieves similar performance with the proposed method LAP on predicting Moderate objects but performs much worse than LAP on the other object roles . This fact supports the conclusion that Prior performs better on Moderate objects that change less and performs worse on Indifferent and Enthusiastic objects that change more .
Compared to all the baselines , the proposed LAP model achieves significantly better performance in most cases than any baseline . The experiments confirm the effectiveness of LAP in predicting object roles .

0.990 0.989 0.989 0.912 0.907 data set contains the interactions among the users of the website . For the experiments , we choose the first sampled snapshot in each year during 2007 to 2012 and denote the obtained six snapshots as R1 to R6 . In this website , each user is labeled by the others as Observer , Apprentice , Journeyer or Master according to his/her importance in the website . Based on these labels , we divide the users into four object role classes : Observer , Apprentice , Journeyer and Master . In the experiments , we use the labeled information at R1 for training , and test the performance of the proposed LAP on detecting , analyzing and predicting the above object roles . Using varying parameter values to test the performance on R1 , we obtain that the optimal number of latent features is 70 .
2 ) Object Role Detection : Table IV summarizes the performance of all the baselines as well as the proposed LAP model on the RobotNet
Overall , the results show similar trends to the results of
SocialEvolution in Table II . PageRank and Centrality can not capture the characteristics of the four object roles thus perform the worst . Coordinates performs well when close to R1 and perform much worse after several snapshots . Among all the baselines , Prior performs the best .
Compared to these baselines , the proposed LAP model achieves the best in most cases . It outperforms the best baseline Prior by up to 39.24 % and on average 1151 % To better illustrate the advantage of the proposed LAP model , in Fig 5 , we show the ROC curves on detecting the Observer objects ( due to the space limit , we show this case only ) .
3 ) Object Role Analysis : To evaluate the performance on analyzing the dynamics of object roles , we do case study on object 99 . Specifically , we use 0 to 3 to represent Observer , Apprentice , Journeyer and Master , respectively . The class number estimated by expectation is scaled to the range of
436
[ 0 , 3π 2 ] . We summarize the results of the object 99 in Fig 6 . According to the votes , in the first snapshot , four users vote this object as Apprentice and two vote the object as Journeyer . Starting from the second snapshot , more and more users vote the object 99 as Master . As we can observe from Fig 6 , this trend on votes is well reflected by the results of the proposed LAP model . The case study supports that the LAP is effective in capturing the dynamics of object roles .
4 ) Object Role Prediction :
In this part , we predict the object roles at the second to the sixth time points using the previous data , and summarize the results in Table V . The results show similar patterns to those in Table III and Table IV . Across the four baselines , DyPageRank and DyCentrality are still not effective in characterizing the four different object classes ; Coordinates significantly suffers from its assumption of viewing object roles as ” Coordinates ” ; and Prior performs the best in the baselines .
The proposed LAP model significantly outperforms all the baselines in most cases over different object roles . LAP improves over the best baseline Prior by up to 22.69 % and on average 586 %
IV . RELATED WORK
As reviewed in Section I , the proposed model significantly differs from the existing studies in the area of dynamic network mining . Besides these , there are also several other approaches that are related to the task in this paper , thus we explicitly discuss them in this section .
As for object role mining in graphs , existing methods [ 14]– [ 17 ] usually adopt the assumption that two objects have the same roles if they have the same relationships to all other objects . This assumption heavily restricts the applicability of these existing methods . For instance , suppose there are two spammers in an email network , and they focus on spamming users from different areas . In this case , the two spammers have the same roles but totally different connections to other objects in the email network , which contradicts with the aforementioned assumption used by the above existing methods .
Besides PageRank [ 2 ] and Centrality [ 13 ] , several other existing methods such as [ 18 ] , [ 19 ] also use statistics in topology to characterize object behaviors . The major drawback of these methods is that the object roles are estimated through subjectively selected topological features , thus these methods may not be discriminative in learning many types of object roles . Moreover , these methods do not incorporate the dynamic information at each time point into the estimation of object roles , which differs them from the proposed method .
V . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper , we have introduced a probability model for learning , analyzing and predicting object roles in dynamic networks . The proposed model effectively integrates structural information , dynamic information and supervised information for extracting the latent feature representation of object roles . The extracted object role representation is then used to identify the role of each node , track the changes of object roles over time , and predict the object roles in dynamic networks . We have also provided the detailed variational bayesian inference for the proposed model . In experiments , we evaluated the proposed model through the tasks of learning the dynamics of people ’s importance and political interests in two real world data sets . Overall , the proposed LAP model significantly outperforms the baselines on learning and predicting seven types of object roles . Moreover , the dynamic patterns extracted by the proposed LAP model well reflect the real changing states of the object roles .
