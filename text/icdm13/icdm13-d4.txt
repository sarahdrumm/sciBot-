Abstract—Biclustering is crucial in finding co expressed genes and their associated conditions in gene expression data . While various biclustering algorithms ( eg , combinatorial , probabilistic modelling , and matrix factorization ) have been proposed and constantly improved in the past decade , data noise and bicluster overlaps make biclustering a still challenging task . It becomes difficult to further improve biclustering performance , without resorting to a new approach . Inspired by the recent progress in unsupervised feature learning using deep neural networks [ 1 ] , in this work , we propose a novel model for biclustering , named AutoDecoder ( AD ) , by relating biclusters to features and leveraging a neural network that is able to automatically learn features from the input data . To suppress severe noise present in gene expression data , we introduce a non uniform signal recovery mechanism : Instead of reconstructing the whole input data to capture the bicluster patterns , AD weighs the zero and non zero parts of the input data differently and is more flexible in dealing with different types of noise . AD is also properly regularized to deal with bicluster overlaps . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first biclustering algorithm that leverages neural network techniques to recover overlapped biclusters hidden in noisy gene expression data . We compared our approach with four state of the art biclustering algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets . On three out of the four real datasets , AD significantly outperforms the other approaches . On controlled synthetic datasets , AD performs the best when noise level is beyond 15 % .

I . INTRODUCTION
High throughput gene expression profiling is readily accessible as the development of new technologies such as the Affymetrix array plates and next generation sequencing , which necessiates advanced analysis tools to deal with massive amounts of data . To analyze expression data , numerous computational tools have been developed and steadily improved , among which , biclustering becomes a dominant unsupervised technique for gene expression analysis .
Biclustering refers to a process of grouping genes and conditions simultaneously , producing a set of biclusters each including a gene set and a condition set . Fig 1 shows two overlapped biclusters in a sample dataset . The gene expression values “ 1 ” , “ 1 ” and “ 0 ” indicate upregulating , downregulating , and unchanged , respectively . As shown in the figure , several important characteristics exist in bicluster recognition : ( 1 ) There are various kinds of biclusters : Genes ( conditions ) can be positively and negatively correlated ;

Fig 1 . Biclusters in a Sample Dataset .
( 2 ) Biclusters can overlap with each other in both gene dimension and condition dimension since multiple pathways containing the same gene could be active under different conditions ;
( 3 ) It is not necessary that each gene ( or condition ) has to participate in at least one bicluster ( not necessarily full coverage ) ;
( 4 ) Bicluster detection shall be robust against heavy noise in the input data .
Due to these unique characteristics , many non overlap , fullcoverage clustering methods are ineffective to recognize embedded biclusters .
To tackle the aforementioned challenges , many biclustering algorithms have been developed . We can roughly classify them into three categories : combinatorial methods , eg , CTWC [ 2 ] , OPSM [ 3 ] , ISA [ 4 ] , BIMAX [ 5 ] , association analysis based RAP [ 6 ] , COALESCE [ 7 ] , and QUBIC [ 8 ] ; probabilistic and generative approaches such as SAMBA [ 9 ] , FABIA [ 10 ] and many others [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] ; matrix factorization methods like spectral clustering [ 14 ] , SSVD [ 15 ] , and S4VD [ 16 ] . While biclustering performance has been significantly improved in the past decade , data noise and bicluster overlaps make the problem still quite challenging . Our controlled experiments will show that when noise level or bicluster overlap degree is high , most of existing algorithms can only discover a small percentage of biclusters . In this work , we are going to reexamine the biclustering problem from a new perspective and demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model . Inspired by the recent progress in unsupervised feature learning through deep neural networks ( ie , deep learning ) [ 1 ] , we relate the biclustering problem to feature learning where the expression pattern of the gene set under the condition set in a bicluster can be regarded as a feature . Different variants of deep neural networks , such as [ 17 ] , [ 18 ] , have recently been tested to have tremendous power in extracting high level features in images . A deep neural network is composed of multiple hidden layers , where a higher ( lower ) hidden layer extracts features at a higher ( lower ) level . In our biclustering setting , we relate the expression of one gene under all conditions to the pixel values of one image . Our interested expression pattern corresponds to the correlations among pixels , which are essentially low level features . Therefore , we save ourselves the trouble of building a deep neural network ; instead , we resort to one neural network with a single hidden layer . Nevertheless , we expect the unsupervised feature learning power of neural networks will still boost the biclustering performance .
Particularly , we generalize sparse autoencoder ( SAE ) , a recently proposed neural network for unsupervised feature learning [ 19 ] , to mine biclusters . While SAE focuses on reconstructing the whole data , we are less interested in data reconstruction , than in extracting bicluster patterns . This motivates us to develop a model that can selectively reconstruct the data by putting different penalties on reconstruction errors in bicluster and non bicluster areas in the input . This design significantly improves the performance over SAE and makes it possible to outperform the existing highly optimized biclustering algorithms . We name this model AutoDecoder ( AD ) .
Our method is also related to matrix factorization , but significantly differs in the following aspects . First , matrix factorization is a linear method while the neural network in our model incorporates a non linear activation layer . PCA or SVD can be considered as a special case when the hidden layer picks a linear activation function . Second , we do not search for a low dimensional approximation to the whole expression data ; instead , we allow partial false reconstructions based on the location of noise , inside or outside biclusters . Third , a sparse activation constraint is imposed on the hidden neurons , which allows us to artificially control the number of genes to be discovered in each bicluster . With these advantages , AD is demonstrated to be more accuate than the leading matrix factorization approaches such as SSVD [ 15 ] and S4VD [ 16 ] . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to relate the biclustering problem to feature learning and apply neural network approaches to biclustering gene expression data . Our motivation is based on the conjecture that since biclustering has been a long standing topic , we might need to tackle the problem from a new perspective that has never been explored by previous studies in detail . Our model parameters are learnt using back propagation and a second order optimization algorithm L BFGS [ 21 ] , which have been popularly exploited in the deep learning literature . According to the optimized model parameters , we then design a bicluster embedding strategy to determine the genes and conditions in a bicluster . Empirically , our biclustering method runs very fast and outperforms the most up to date leading methods such as QUBIC , COALESCE , FABIA , and S4VD .

II . PRELIMINARIES
In this section , we build a connection between biclustering and the sparse autoencoder ( SAE ) [ 19 ] . Then we discuss the necessity to develop a generalized model AutoDecoder .
The graphical representation of an autoencoder with a single hidden layer is shown in Fig 2 . We begin with clarifying the notations in the context of biclusering . ( 1 ) 𝑋 : an 𝑀 × 𝑁 gene expression matrix , where 𝑀 is the number of conditions and 𝑁 is the number of genes . 𝑥(𝑖 ) 𝑚 denotes the expression value of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ gene under the 𝑚𝑡ℎ condition . ( 2 ) 𝑊 : a 𝐾 × 𝑀 matrix , the combination weights between layer and the hidden layer . Each element 𝑤𝑘,𝑚 the input represents the contribution of the expression under the 𝑚𝑡ℎ condition to bicluster 𝑘 , and determines whether the 𝑚𝑡ℎ condition is a member in bicluster 𝑘 or not . The weights in the first layer and those in the second layer are optionally tied 2 =𝑊 [ 1 ] . 𝑏1 : a 𝐾×1 vector ; 𝑏2 : an 𝑀 ×1 together by 𝑊1=𝑊 𝑇 vector . 𝑏1 and 𝑏2 work as the bias terms at the input layer and the hidden layer respectively . ( 3 ) 𝑎(𝑖 ) : a 𝐾 × 1 vector representing activation values of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ gene in 𝐾 hidden neurons , where each of the 𝐾 hidden neurons denotes a potential bicluster . Unless otherwise stated , we employ the popular element wise sigmoid activation function , ie , 𝑎(𝑖 ) = sigmoid(𝑊 𝑥(𝑖 ) + 𝑏1 ) . Each component 𝑘 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) encodes how likely a gene belongs to bicluster 𝑎(𝑖 ) 𝑘 . Let 𝐴 = [ 𝑎(1 ) , 𝑎(2 ) , . . . , 𝑎(𝑖 ) , . . . , 𝑎(𝑁 ) ] be the activation matrix of all the genes .
ˆ𝑋 = [ ˆ𝑥(1 ) , ˆ𝑥(2 ) , . . . , ˆ𝑥(𝑖 ) , . . . , ˆ𝑥(𝑁 ) ] , where ˆ𝑥(𝑖 ) = 𝑊 𝑇 𝑎(𝑖 ) + 𝑏2 . reconstructed gene expression data .
ˆ𝑋 :

Parameters in an autoencoder are learnt by minimizing the reconstruction error between 𝑋 and ˆ𝑋 . For each hidden neuron , its activation rate is defined as ˆ𝜌𝑘 = ∑𝑁 𝑘 /𝑁 . Let a 𝐾 × 1 vector 𝜌 be our expected activation 𝑖=1 𝑎(𝑖 ) rates of the 𝐾 hidden neurons . The Kullback Leibler ( KL ) divergence between a Bernoulli random variable with mean 𝜌𝑘 and a Bernoulli random variable with mean ˆ𝜌𝑘 is added to the objective function as an additional penalty term . Autoencoder with this sparsity penalty term is called sparse autoencoder ( SAE ) [ 19 ] . This term can be entitled with more meanings in our setting . In the biclustering context , ˆ𝜌𝑁 can be regarded as the number of genes each bicluster actually contains after learning , which is regularized to be close to 𝜌𝑁 we expect each bicluster to contain . Usually , it is a desideratum to obtain a bicluster which is neither too small nor too large . By using this term , the number of genes in one bicluster can be controlled artificially , which cannot be achieved by most of the existing biclustering algorithms . 2𝑁 ∥𝑋 − ˆ𝑋∥2
SAE learns the optimal model parameters by minimizing 2∥𝑊∥2 𝐹 , the cost where ∥ ⋅ ∥𝐹 is the Frobenius norm . SAE can work well when the expression data are uniformly corrupted by the same Gaussian noise ( the same mean and variance ) . However , in practice , Gaussian random noise inside and outside biclusters could be different . In such situation , putting equal weights on reconstructing the bicluster part and non bicluster part of the expression data will hurt bicluster finding . Therefore , we develop a non uniform weighting strategy to discriminatively treat the background and the patterns . We call the new model , AutoDecoder ( AD ) , to emphasize that it decodes the biclusters rather than encodes the entire expression data .

In this section , we introduce our model AutoDecoder ( AD ) , followed by discussions on model solution and bicluster recognition processes .
A . Optimization Formulation
AutoDecoder shares the same neural network structure as shown in Fig 2 . However , it enhances sparse autoencoder ( SAE ) to be more robust against noise and bicluster overlaps .

The above objective function is a sum of four terms , where 𝛽 , 𝛾 , and 𝜆 take non negative values and control the trade off
709 among different regularization terms . We now explain each of the terms in details :
𝑚 = 0 and 𝐼𝑚,𝑖 = 1 denoting 𝑥(𝑖 )
∙ Term ( I ) quantifies the average reconstruction error with non uniform weights . 𝐼 is an indicator matrix with 𝐼𝑚,𝑖 = 𝑚 ∕= 0 . 0 denoting 𝑥(𝑖 ) 𝛼 controls the relative weight of reconstructing the zero values and non zero values in the input data . One can check that when 𝛼 = 1 , AD will put the same emphasis on reconstructing the zero values and non zero values ( uniform weighting ) . In this case , this term degenerates to the reconstruction function in SAE . Conceptually , our model is suitable for any data with background as zeros and patterns as non zeros . In this work , we focus on the discretized matrix with elements { 1 , 0 , 1} , representing down regulating , unchanged , and up regulating . ∙ Term ( II ) is the sparsity penalty term as in SAE . To make the activation of each hidden neuron as sparse as we desire , we constrain the KL divergence between the sparsity parameter 𝜌𝑘 and the activation rate ˆ𝜌𝑘 : + ( 1 − 𝜌𝑘 ) log 1−𝜌𝑘 KL(𝜌𝑘∥ˆ𝜌𝑘 ) = 1− ˆ𝜌𝑘 .
∙ In Term ( III ) , 𝑆 is an 𝑀 × 𝑀 symmetric matrix , where 𝑆𝑖,𝑗 is the absolute value of cosine similarity between the 𝑖𝑡ℎ condition ( row ) and 𝑗𝑡ℎ condition in matrix 𝑋 . If 𝑆𝑖,𝑗 is large enough , two conditions 𝑖 and 𝑗 should have similar membership after optimization ( ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑖∣ ∼ ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑗∣ , for any 𝑘 ) . This term prevents dramatic membership change of two similar conditions , which will enhance the robustness against bicluster overlaps . ∙ Term ( IV ) is a regularizer named as weight decay ( Chapter 5 in [ 20] ) , where ∥𝑊∥1 is the 𝐿1 norm of 𝑊 , ie , ∥𝑊∥1 = 𝑚=1 ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑚∣ . 𝐿1 norm regularization tends to recover 𝑊 with more sparsity by forcing the insignificant values to zeros , which will make easier the bicluster membership interpretation . We neglect the bias terms 𝑏1 and 𝑏2 because their inclusion will make the results of 𝑊 depend on the choice of origin ( Section 1.1 and 551 in [ 20] ) .

B . Model Solution The classic L BFGS algorithm [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] is applied to minimize the objective function ℋ . L BFGS needs the derivatives of parameters . They are calculated by the classic backpropagation algorithm [ 23 ] , where error messages are split at each neuron and then propagated to the neurons at previous layers . Given the current parameters ( 𝑊 𝐾×𝑀 , 𝑏𝐾×1 , 𝑏𝑀×1 ) , 2 the backpropagation procedure is performed as follows :

Once the objective function ℋ and its derivatives are computed , the L BFGS algorithm is applied to minimize ℋ . instead of storing the dense Hessian During optimization , approximation matrix , the L BFGS algorithm saves only a few vectors to represent the approximation implicitly , which significantly decreases the memory requirement . Since LBFGS is a classic and well established algorithm [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] , we omit the detailed analysis on its complexity and convergence rate . In practice , we observe that the L BFGS algorithm converges very fast ( within around 1000 iterations on all the real datasets ) .
C . Bicluster Recognition
In order to detect the embedded biclusters , we need to select both genes and conditions for each bicluster . The weight ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑚∣ determines the contribution of the 𝑚𝑡ℎ condition to the 𝑘𝑡ℎ bicluster . If ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑚∣ is large enough , the bicluster should contain the 𝑚𝑡ℎ condition . Similarly for selecting genes into one bicluster , if the activation value 𝑎(𝑖 ) is high , the 𝑖𝑡ℎ gene should belong to bicluster 𝑘 .
𝑘
The bicluster embedding process is summarized as follows : For each hidden neuron 𝑘 , ie , each potential bicluster , ∙ Gene selection 𝑘 ∣>𝛿 ( 𝛿 ∈ ( 0 , 1) ) ; Pick any gene 𝑖 corresponding to ∣𝑎(𝑖 ) Pick any condition 𝑚 corresponding to ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑚∣>𝜖 ( 𝜖 ∈ ( 0 , 1) ) .
∙ Condition selection
The thresholds 𝛿 and 𝜖 can be tuned by users ; their values are fixed at 0.7 and 0.3 respectively for all of our experiments unless otherwise stated . Intuitively , the same threshold should work for both the gene and condition selection ; however , elements in weight matrix 𝑊 are usually much smaller due to the weight decay regularizer ; we pick different thresholds respectively for the gene and condition selection .
D . Robustness Against Noise
One of the major contributions we made is the non uniform weighting of the zero values and non zero values in the input data . As shown in Fig 1 , biclusters contain expression values representing upregulating ( +1 ) or downregulating ( −1 ) .

Performance of AD with 𝛼 = {0.5 , 1 , 1.5} wrt Different Noise
Therefore , there are two kinds of noise : Type A noise corresponding to the cases where nonzeros appear outside the biclusters , and Type B noise corresponding to the cases where zeros appear inside a bicluster . Accordingly , there are two kinds of reconstruction errors : ( 1 ) false negative error when +1 or −1 is reconstructed as 0 ; ( 2 ) false positive error when 0 is reconstructed as +1 or −1 . According to Term ( I ) in ℋ , penalty weight on the false positive error is controlled by 𝛼 while penalty weight on the false negative error is set to 1 . When 𝛼 is greater than 1 , AD allows more false negative errors in the reconstruction process . In this situation , AD tends to exclude ±1 ’s out from the final patterns than to include 0 ’s into the patterns , which is robust against Type A noise . In real gene expression datasets , we first run existing algorithms to detect biclusters and estimate the dominant noise type . In the case where Type A noise occurs more often than Type B noise , 𝛼 > 1 is recommended . Here we verify our analysis on AD ’s robustness against noise . We generate a set of matrices of size 100 × 500 . In each matrix , 100 of the 500 columns are 1 ’s while the others are 0 ’s . The area in the matrix containing 1 ’s is called pattern area while the area containing 0 ’s is called background area . We consider two simple , yet illustrative , scenarios . In the first scenario , the elements in background area are flipped to 1 ’s with probability 𝑝 ranging from 0 to 1 , whereas the pattern area is kept clean ( Type A noise ) . The flipping probability 𝑝 is named noise level . Oppositely , in the second scenario , the elements in pattern area are flipped to 0 ’s with probability 𝑝 ( noise level ) ranging from 0 to 1 whereas the background area is kept clean ( Type B noise ) . At each noise level , we generate 50 matrices and compute the average F score ( See Section V A ) . We show the result of AD with 𝛼 = 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 in Fig 3 . 𝛼 = 1 corresponds to the uniform weighting as in SAE . Obviously , with an appropriate 𝛼 our proposed model is more robust than the classic SAE approach .
E . Robustness Against Bicluster Overlaps
Many of existing biclustering algorithms cannot detect biclusters accurately when biclusters overlap at both gene and condition dimensions . Term ( III ) in ℋ is designed to deal with such two dimension overlaps . Our intuition is that if two conditions ( genes ) have similar expression values , they should have similar bicluster membership . That is , for a condition

𝑖,𝑗 pair ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) and any bicluster 𝑘 , ( ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑖∣ − ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑗∣)2 should be as small as possible if the gene expression values in condition 𝑖 is similar to that in condition 𝑗 . Furthermore , if one condition is similar to conditions in multiple biclusters , it should belong to these biclusters simultaneously , thus ∑𝐾 resulting in biclusters overlapped in conditions . Formally , ( ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑖∣ − ∣𝑊𝑘,𝑗∣)2 should be minimized 𝑘=1 𝑆(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ) where 𝑆(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ) is the similarity between the expression values under condition 𝑖 and condition 𝑗 . Similarly for a gene ∑ 𝑖∕=𝑗 𝑆(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒 ) 𝑘 )2 should be minipair ( 𝑖 , 𝑗 ) , mized where 𝑆(𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒 ) is the similarity between the expression values of gene 𝑖 and gene 𝑗 across all the conditions . Due to our neural network structure 𝑎(𝑖 ) = sigmoid(𝑊 𝑥(𝑖 ) + 𝑏1 ) , if two genes have similar expression values ( 𝑥(𝑖 ) ∼ 𝑥(𝑗) ) , they will naturally have similar activation values ( 𝑎(𝑖 ) ∼ 𝑎(𝑗) ) . Therefore , in AD , only the condition term is included , and 𝑆(𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 ) is replaced with 𝑆 for simplicity .

IV . BICLUSTER PATTERNS
Fig 6 . Bicluster Recognition with Pattern V .
AutoDecoder can identify a broad range of bicluster patterns in one trial . Fig 4 shows five types of bicluster patterns that can be found by AD .
( I III ) In these three patterns , conditions can be either positively or negatively correlated under the gene set whereas genes are positively correlated under the condition set . Our AD model can directly discover such patterns . For some 𝑘 , the weights 𝑊𝑘,𝑚 corresponding to the condition set will be large in magnitude . The sign of the 𝑊𝑘,𝑚 will be the same as that of the expressions under the 𝑚𝑡ℎ condition . The gene set will have large activation values in the 𝑘𝑡ℎ neuron .
( IV V ) In the fourth and fifth patterns , conditions can be either positively or negatively correlated under the gene set whereas genes can also be either positively or negatively correlated under the condition set . For such patterns , our AD model with a sigmoid hidden layer splits the bicluster into two subclusters in which the two subsets of genes behave oppositely . This is because column 1 ( 3 ) and column 2 ( 4 ) cannot simultaneously have large activation values under the same hidden neuron . Since both subclusters are associated with
711 the same condition set in our embedding process , they can be combined through postprocessing . Alternatively , if the sigmoid activation function in the hidden layer is replaced by a tanh activation function , these patterns can be directly discovered . We are going to show that AD with a tanh activation layer is able to discover Patterns IV and V . Recall that in Section II , 𝑎(𝑖 ) = sigmoid(𝑊 𝑥(𝑖 ) + 𝑏1 ) . Now we replace sigmoid with a tanh function , ie , 𝑎(𝑖 ) = tanh(𝑊 𝑥(𝑖 ) + 𝑏1 ) ∈ ( −1 , 1 ) . As long as ∣𝑎(𝑖)∣ is large , we regard the 𝑖𝑡ℎ gene to be active . In this case , the original definition of the sparsity parameter ˆ𝜌𝑘 = 𝑘 /𝑁 is problematic ; therefore , we re define 𝑘 ∣/𝑁 , 2 ˆ𝜌𝑘 = however , we favor the former due to its smoothness . All other components in our original AD model are kept unchanged . We generate two toy matrices of size 10× 50 , in which the 10 rows and the first 10 columns form a bicluster with Pattern IV and Pattern V respectively . The number of biclusters 𝐾 is set at 1 . Fig 5 and 6 show the membership of rows and

The lower left subfigure provides the learnt weights of the 10 rows ( 𝑊1,𝑚 : 𝑚 = 1 , . . . , 10 ) while the lower right subfigure illustrates the activation values of the 50 columns ( 𝐴1,𝑛 : 𝑛 = 1 , . . . , 50 ) . According to the bicluster recognition process discussed in Section III C , both the columns and rows belonging to the bicluster can be successfully identified due to a high magnitude in either weights or activation values .

In this section , we present empirical studies of AutoDecoder ( AD ) on both real gene expression datasets and controlled synthetic datasets , and compare AD with the state of the art biclustering algorithms in different categories : ( 1 ) Combinatorial search , Qubic [ 8 ] and COALESCE[7 ] , ( 2 ) Probabilistic model , FABIA [ 10 ] , and ( 3 ) Matrix factorization , S4VD [ 16 ] . These four algorithms represent the best results in their own category after a decade of efforts in searching high quality biclusters in gene expression data . A detailed comparison of many other existing algorithms with FABIA is available in [ 10 ] .
AD was implemented in MATLAB . All the experiments were conducted on a 3.4GHZ , 16GB , Intel PC running Windows 7 .
A . Evaluation Measures
Suppose 𝑀∗
To assess various biclustering approaches , we use the average Relevance and Recovery scores , which were widely adopted in biclustering literature , such as S4VD [ 16 ] , QUBIC [ 8 ] , and BIMAX [ 5 ] . Overall , these two scores quantify the similarity between the set of computed biclusters and the set of true biclusters in the data . is the set of true biclusters , and 𝑀 is the set of discovered biclusters each of which contains a gene set G and a condition set C . We denote 𝑀∗ and 𝑀 respectively as 𝑀∗ = {𝑀∗ 𝑚∗} and 𝑀 = {𝑀1 , 𝑀2 , , 𝑀𝑚} . 2 , , 𝑀∗ 𝑖 and 𝑀𝑖 = 𝐺𝑖 × 𝐶𝑖 , where × is the Let 𝑀∗ 𝑖 = 𝐺∗ Cartesian product . The average Relevance and Recovery scores are defined as follows :
1 , 𝑀∗ 𝑖 × 𝐶∗
Relevance =
Recovery =
1 𝑚
1 𝑚∗
𝑚∑
𝑖=1
𝑚∗∑
𝑖=1 max
𝑗∈{1,2,,𝑚∗} max
𝑗∈{1,2,,𝑚}
𝑗
𝑀𝑖 ∩ 𝑀∗ 𝑀𝑖 ∪ 𝑀∗ 𝑖 ∩ 𝑀𝑗 𝑀∗ 𝑖 ∪ 𝑀𝑗 𝑀∗
𝑗
𝑀𝑖∩𝑀∗ 𝑀𝑖∪𝑀∗
𝑗
𝑗 where is the well known Jaccard coefficient [ 24 ] . The average Relevance evaluates to what degree the discovered biclusters represent the true biclusters , whereas the average Recovery measures how well the true biclusters are recovered by the current biclustering algorithm . We calculate the harmonic mean of the Relevance and Recovery scores , 𝐹 = 2𝑅𝑒𝑙∗𝑅𝑒𝑐 in order to jointly consider them . Note 𝑅𝑒𝑙+𝑅𝑒𝑐 , that although there are various kinds of evaluation measures available for general clustering problems , for biclustering ,
712 we select the most widely adopted Relevance and Recovery measures in the literature .
The performance on all the simulated datasets is evaluated using 𝐹 score computed as above . However , for real gene expression datasets , ground truth on the bicluster membership of genes is usually not available , therefore we can only compute the scores on the condition clusters each of which corresponds to the condition set within a bicluster , ie , 𝑀∗ 𝑖 and 𝑀𝑖 = 𝐶𝑖 . Meanwhile , the biological significance of the gene set within a detected bicluster is evaluated . This strategy was also adopted in our competing algorithms [ 10 ] , [ 16 ] .
𝑖 = 𝐶∗
B . Gene Expression Datasets
We experimented four real gene expression datasets widely used in biclustering studies : breast cancer , multiple tissue types , diffuse large B cell lymphoma , and lung cancer . For the first three datasets , Hoshida et al . [ 25 ] clustered the conditions using additional datasets and verified the clusters by gene set enrichment analysis . FABIA [ 10 ] studied how well biclustering algorithms can re identify these clusters without any additional information . Similarly , for the lung cancer dataset , S4VD [ 16 ] and SSVD [ 15 ] first compared the obtained condition clusters with ground truth and then evaluated gene sets within biclusters by doing enrichment analysis . We adopted a similar approach to evaluate the detected biclusters . We briefly describe the datasets as follows :
( a ) Breast cancer dataset [ 26 ] . As stated in [ 10 ] , the sample ( ie , condition ) S54 is an outlier and was removed from the original data . The dataset has 1,213 genes and 97 samples .
( b ) Multiple tissue types dataset [ 27 ] . It contains 5,565 genes and 102 samples from diverse tissues and cell lines . Hoshida et al . [ 25 ] discovered four sample clusters from this dataset .
( c ) Diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) dataset [ 28 ] . This dataset was to predict the survival after chemotherapy , and contains 3,795 genes and 58 samples . Four sample clusters were discovered in [ 25 ] .
( d ) Lung cancer dataset [ 29 ] . It was previously analyzed in [ 16 ] , [ 15 ] . 12,625 genes under 56 samples were measured using the Affymetrix 95av2 GeneChip . are not valued among in the procedure discretization increasing order for each gene , sort
1 ) Preprocessing : For
{−1 , 0 , 1} , we similar those gene expression datasets adopted to QUBIC [ 8 ] . its original expression as that a Specifically , values on 𝑀 conditions follows:(𝑥𝜋(1 ) , 𝑥𝜋(2 ) , . . . , 𝑥𝜋(𝑠−1 ) , 𝑥𝜋(𝑠 ) , . . . , 𝑥𝜋(𝑐−1 ) , 𝑥𝜋(𝑐 ) , 𝑥𝜋(𝑐+1 ) , . . . , 𝑥𝜋(𝑀−𝑠+1 ) , 𝑥𝜋(𝑀−𝑠+2 ) , . . . , 𝑥𝜋(𝑀 ))𝑇 , where 𝜋(𝑗 ) is the permutated 𝑗𝑡ℎ index , 𝑐 = ⌈𝑀/2⌉ and 𝑠 − 1 = ⌊𝑀 𝑞⌋ . Same as [ 8 ] , we set 𝑞 at 006 A condition is considered as downregulating ( −1 ) for a gene if its expression value is less than 𝑥𝜋(𝑐 ) − 𝑑 and as is greater than 𝑥𝜋(𝑐 ) + 𝑑 , where upregulating ( +1 ) if it 𝑑 = min{𝑥𝜋(𝑐 ) − 𝑥𝜋(𝑠 ) , 𝑥𝜋(𝑀−𝑠+1 ) − 𝑥𝜋(𝑐)} ; otherwise , the gene is not activated ( ie , 0 ) . The rationale to choose this procedure is given in the Supplementary Data of [ 8 ] . The choice is not exclusive ; other discretization methods can also be applied here . Since we find that FABIA , S4VD , and COALESCE do not work better on preprocessed data , the raw data are used as their input .
2 ) Parameter Setting : Biclustering algorithms generally involve many parameters . We explored the number of biclusters in all the methods except COALESCE from 5 to 8 , slightly larger than the true number in each dataset , as suggested in FABIA . COALESCE can find any number of biclusters that satisfy their criteria . In these popularly used real datasets , only a small number of biclusters are present ; nevertheless , we will later synthesize datasets with more biclusters embedded for comprehensive comparison . For each competing algorithm , we tuned 2 to 4 important parameters according to their manual to show their best performance on each dataset .
𝑁 , 𝛾 = 0.2
𝑁 , and 𝜆 = 0.1√
For AD , we observe that a fixed setting of parameters generalize very well across different datasets . Particularly , we set 𝛽 = 2𝑀√ 𝑁 . Two important parameters in AD are 𝛼 and 𝜌 . There are three typical values for 𝛼 : 1.5 , 0.5 , and 1 , which can deal with Type A noise , Type B noise , and balanced Type A and B noise as discussed in Section III D . For 𝜌 , it will be easier to set if one has any prior knowledge or preference over the number of genes contained in biclusters . In our experiments , we first run other algorithms to get a rough idea about the noise type and gene cluster size . In the real gene expression datasets we tested , Type A noise occurs more often than Type B noise , and therefore , we set 𝛼 at 15 We randomly draw each component of 𝜌 from the interval [ 0.01 , 0.03 ] , as we expect a bicluster to contain 1 % ∼ 3 % the total number of genes .
3 ) Performance Comparisons : On all of these datasets , AD completes biclustering within 2 minutes . The results are summarized in Fig 7 . Columns “ 𝑅𝑒𝑙 . ” , “ 𝑅𝑒𝑐 . ” , and “ 𝐹 ’ respectively provide the average Relevance score , average Recovery score and their harmonic mean . The columns “ #g ” , “ #s ” , and “ #bc ” give the average number of genes , conditions in each bicluster , and the number of discovered biclusters respectively . “ TN ” gives the true number of condition clusters in each dataset . For the breast cancer dataset , FABIA performs the best . For the remaining three datasets , AD significantly outperforms other tuned biclustering algorithms . Understanding the differences between the breast cancer dataset and other datasets will be helpful to further improve the performance , which we leave for future study . The superiority of AD over SAE verifies the effectiveness of our proposed strategy in dealing with real data . Moreover , AD can achieve better performance once the parameters are tuned as in our competing algorithms .
To evaluate the biological significance of the gene set in a discovered bicluster , as in [ 8 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 16 ] , we conducted gene ontology ( GO ) enrichment analysis by computing the 𝑃 value [ 8 ] of each biological category wrt the gene set . Particularly , we caclulate the probability of having 𝑟 ( 𝑟 > 0 ) genes of the same biological category in a bicluster with 𝑛 genes as :
Pr(𝑟∣𝑁 , 𝑚 , 𝑛 ) =
(
𝑚 𝑟
)( (
) 𝑁−𝑚 𝑛−𝑟 ) 𝑁 𝑛

Fig 7 . Results on Real Datasets . where 𝑁 is the total number of genes in the input , and 𝑚 is the number of genes from that biological category and encoded in the input . For each biological category with 𝑟 > 0 in one bicluster , we calculate its 𝑃 value wrt the gene set in the bicluster using the probability defined by ( 1 ) . We then use the smallest 𝑃 value among all possible biological categories as the 𝑃 value of the current bicluster . The smaller the 𝑃 value , the more biologically significant the bicluster [ 8 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 10 ] . Our model can generally discover biclusters with 𝑃 value around or less than 10−4 , much often less than 10−10 on all the datasets , which is comparable to the gene set analysis result shown by FABIA [ 10 ] and S4VD [ 16 ] . Due to space limit , we only show the summarized gene enrichment analysis results on the last three datasets .
For Multiple Tissue dataset , Bicluster 1 is enriched with genes related to the acyl CoA metabolic process and the thioester metabolic process ( 𝑃 value 2.8 × 10−6 ) . Genes related to collagen fibril organization enrich Bicluster 2 ( 𝑃 value 4.0× 10−6 ) . The most significant GO terms in Bicluster 3 are related to immune response ( 𝑃 value 12×10−20 ) Genes in Bicluster 4 are related to positive regulation of superoxide anion generation ( 𝑃 value 6.9 × 10−5 ) . The most significant GO terms in Bicluster 5 are related to G protein coupled receptor protein signaling pathway ( 𝑃 value 6.9 × 10−7 ) .
For DLBCL dataset , genes in Bicluster 1 are most related to the regulation of transcription involved in G1/S phase of mitotic cell cycle ( 𝑃 value 1.1 × 10−4 ) . Bicluster 2 is highly related to defense response ( 𝑃 value 6.3× 10−10 ) . Bicluster 3 is enriched by genes from the regulation of peptide hormone secretion . The most significant GO terms in Bicluster 5 are highly related to the regulation of phospholipase activity ( 𝑃 value 5.3 × 10−4 ) . Bicluster 4 is too small to allow for a reliable biological interpretation .
In the discovered biclusters from Lung Cancer dataset , Bicluster 1 is enriched with genes related to positive regulation of kidney development ( 𝑃 value 22×10−6 ) The most significant GO terms in Bicluster 2 are highly related to cell division ( 𝑃 value 9.2 × 10−26 ) . Bicluster 3 is related to interferongamma mediated signaling pathway ( 𝑃 value 1.2 × 10−12 ) . Genes related to mitochondrial electron transport enrich Bicluster 4 ( 𝑃 value 39×10−8 ) The most significant biological category in Bicluster 5 is related to cell adhesion ( 𝑃 value 2.2 × 10−10 ) .
The evaluation of biclustering results illustrates that our approach not only improves the performance on condition clusters of these datasets , but also guarantees the biological significance of the gene sets discovered in the biclusters .
𝑁 , and 𝜆 = 0.1√
4 ) Sensitivity Analysis : For most of the learning problems , model selection is a critical problem . The learning performance might vary significantly under different parameter settings . 𝛽 , 𝛾 , and 𝜆 are our model parameters that control the trade off among the regularization terms . We fix 𝛽 = 2𝑀√ 𝑁 , 𝛾 = 0.2 𝑁 on the previous experiments . In this subsection , we study the impact of the parameters on the performance of AD . Specifically , we fix other parameters as before and let one of {𝛽 , 𝛾 , 𝜆} vary . As shown in Fig 8 , AD is generally not very sensitive with respect to these parameters , since high quality scores can be achieved under a large range of the studied parameters .
C . Synthetic Datasets
Our algorithm is also tested on a set of controlled synthetic datasets , which are generated as follows : Given the matrix size 100 × 500 and the number of biclusters 𝐾 , the number of rows 𝑟 in a bicluster is randomly selected from the interval [ 10 , 30 ] , and the number of columns 𝑐 is randomly selected from [ 50 , 100 ] ; then we randomly choose 𝑟 rows from the total 100 rows and 𝑐 columns from the total 500 columns as the members of the bicluster . The matrix is initially filled with “ 0 ” . Each bicluster is filled with “ 1 ” . In total , 𝐾 biclusters are generated . We then inject noise to each matrix by flipping the value of elements . Specifically , we flip the 1 ’s inside biclusters to be zeros with probability 𝑝 and flip the 0 ’s outside biclusters to be 1 or −1 respectively with probability 𝑝 2 . The flipping probability 𝑝 is named noise level .

Fig 10 . True Positive Rate ( TPR ) and False Positive Rate ( FPR ) of AD .
For each parameter setting 𝐾 and 𝑝 , 100 matrices are generated and the average performance of each algorithm on these 100 matrices is measured . We tune parameters in our competing algorithms and show their best performance . For AD , we still use a fixed parameter setting , where 𝛼 = 1 and 𝜌𝑘 = 01,∀𝑘
Fig 9 illustrates the performance of five algorithms . It is observed that AD significantly outperforms all the other algorithms when noise level is beyond 15 % . When we increase the number of biclusters , recognition becomes more and more difficult because overlapping among biclusters also increases significantly . For example , around 12 % of the nonzeros belong to two biclusters when 𝐾 = 10 , whereas the ratio increases to 22 % when 𝐾 = 20 . In such situation , all the competitors are only able to detect a much smaller percentage of true biclusters , while AD still maintains a much higher F score . Fig 9 shows that AD covers the situation ( high noise and high overlaps ) where the existing algorithms cannot work well .
We further show the change of the true positive rate ( TPR ) and false positive rate ( FPR ) of AD , when varying the recognition thresholds 𝛿 and 𝜖 in Section III C . We detail how to caculate the TPR and FPR in our biclustering setting : We first map each detected bicluster 𝑀𝑖 to a true bicluster 𝑀∗ 𝑗 𝑀𝑖∩𝑀∗ by maximizing the Jaccard coefficient , i.e , by max . 𝑀𝑖∪𝑀∗ We compute the TPR and FPR for each true bicluster , and then obtain their average as the overall TPR and FPR of AD . The above synthetic datasets with noise level at 0.2 are used for study . Fig 10 shows at 0.2 noise level , AD generally still achieves a high TPR while keeping the FPR at a low level . On the other hand , AD turns out to be not very sensitive to the thresholds , since similar results can be achieved under a large range of the thresholds .

The first biclustering algorithm for gene expression analysis was proposed in the year 2000 by Cheng and Church [ 30 ] . Since then , various combinatorial biclustering algorithms have been developed , including the Coupled Two Way Clustering [ 2 ] , the Order Preserving SubMatrix [ 3 ] , the Iterative Signature Algorithm [ 4 ] , BIMAX developed by [ 5 ] , QUBIC [ 8 ] , and COALESCE [ 7 ] . An association rule based method RAP [ 6 ] also falls into this category . We include the recent QUBIC and COALESCE for comparative studies in our experiments .

0.5 been steadily improved as the development of new algorithms . Probabilistic and generative methods are also available for biclustering gene expression data . The statistical algorithmic method for bicluster analysis ( SAMBA [ 9 ] ) is one of the earliest probabilistic approaches to biclustering . Other approaches include those proposed in [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . FABIA [ 10 ] is one of the recently developed probabilistic approaches , and has demonstrated good performance on various real datasets . Another category of biclustering algorithms is based on matrix factorization . Spectral biclustering [ 14 ] applies singular vector decomposition ( SVD ) to extracting expression patterns in a matrix . It is indicated in [ 31 ] that SVD is capable of finding biclusters . Lee et al . [ 15 ] developed a sparse SVD ( SSVD ) algorithm . S4VD [ 16 ] improved SSVD [ 15 ] by incorporating a stability selection technique . Recently , query based biclustering algorithms [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] are developed , which utilize a set of seed genes provided by the user to prune the search space and guide the biclustering algorithm . Hanczar et al . [ 34 ] focus on the corrected measurement of the biclustering methods . Despite of many existing studies on biclustering , we are motivated to further improve the performance by approaching the problem from a novel perspective .
Cross association [ 35 ] , co clustering [ 36 ] , [ 37 ] , [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] , exclusive row biclustering [ 40 ] , monochromatic biclustering proposed in [ 41 ] , block models [ 42 ] , Boolean Matrix Factorization [ 43 ] , [ 44 ] , and techniques on noisy information theoretic tiles detection [ 45 ] have been applied to group rows and columns simultaneously in a matrix . Each of these methods also falls into one of the three previously mentioned categories , ie , combinatorial approach , probabilistic modelling , or matrix factorization . These existing models usually have one or more of the following characteristics : ( 1 ) Only 0 1 binary input can be handled , which is impossible to detect negative correlations ; ( 2 ) Disjoint/non overlapping or full coverage biclusters are generated , which is different from our emphasis introduced in Section I ; ( 3 ) They rely on stochastic approximation to do inference due to lack of computationally efficient algorithms . Our work is inspired by deep learning , ie , unsupervised feature learning using deep neural networks . Since the breakthrough on training multi layer neural networks was made by Hinton and Salakhutdinov[1 ] , numerous studies on learning deep feature hierarchies have been conducted . Among them , the most related one is sparse autoencoder proposed in [ 19 ] . Different from sparse autoencoder , our model is more resistant against noise by differently reconstructing the bicluster and background part of the input data . Besides , we also enhance the ability of sparse autoencoder to deal with bicluster overlaps . Through extensive experiments , we clearly demonstrate that our neural network based approach can outperform the existing biclustering algorithms , as well as the original sparse autoencoder .
VII . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
We developed a novel biclustering approach , AutoDecoder , to effectively discover biclusters in highly noisy expression data . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to relate the biclustering problem to unsupervised feature learning methods and apply neural network approaches to biclustering gene expression data . AutoDecoder associates the activation of hidden neurons in a two layer neural network with the membership of genes and conditions in biclusters . Compared with four state of the art algorithms , AutoDecoder
715 performs better on both real and synthetic datasets , especially when there are more overlapped biclusters and higher noise . Our experimental results show that neural network is a promising approach to biclustering , a long standing problem in gene expression data analysis .
Apart from evaluation in terms of Relevance and Recovery scores , and 𝑃 value , it will be interesting to verify whether the biclusters recognized by AutoDecoder are more useful to biologists in the future . Biclustering methods usually involve many parameters . Another very useful future work will be to test different parameter settings to fully explore their potential , especially for AutoDecoder . Since biclustering has been a long standing topic , to further improve the performance , one might need to explore new ideas different from existing biclustering methodologies .
