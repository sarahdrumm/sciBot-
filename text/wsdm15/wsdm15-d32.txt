ABSTRACT
Keywords
User profiling is crucial to many online services . Several recent studies suggest that demographic attributes are predictable from different online behavioral data , such as users’ “ Likes ” on Facebook , friendship relations , and the linguistic characteristics of tweets . But location check ins , as a bridge of users’ offline and online lives , have by and large been overlooked in inferring user profiles .
In this paper , we investigate the predictive power of location check ins for inferring users’ demographics and propose a simple yet general location to profile ( L2P ) framework . More specifically , we extract rich semantics of users’ check ins in terms of spatiality , temporality , and location knowledge , where the location knowledge is enriched with semantics mined from heterogeneous domains including both online customer review sites and social networks . Additionally , tensor factorization is employed to draw out low dimensional representations of users’ intrinsic check in preferences considering the above factors . Meanwhile , the extracted features are used to train predictive models for inferring various demographic attributes .
We collect a large dataset consisting of profiles of 159 , 530 verified users from an online social network . Extensive experimental results based upon this dataset validate that : 1 ) Location checkins are diagnostic representations of a variety of demographic attributes , such as gender , age , education background , and marital status ; 2 ) The proposed framework substantially outperforms compared models for profile inference in terms of various evaluation metrics , such as precision , recall , F measure , and AUC .

INTRODUCTION
Long conceived as a significant research area , the inference of demographic attributes has been extensively studied in linguistics [ 14 , 26 ] , psychology [ 8 ] , and sociology [ 17 ] . Before the rise of social networks , a host of different works have looked into data sources from a myriad of domains , such as Internet browsing behaviors [ 18 ] , written texts [ 11 ] , telephone conversations [ 5 ] , real world mobile network communication records ( CALL and SMS ) [ 10 ] and answers to specific psychological tests [ 8 ] to predict various profile attributes like gender , age , income , and personality .
The recent explosive growth of online social media and social networking websites has allowed billions of users around the world to create and view friendship connections , self expressions , newsfeeds , etc . , and lifted the role of profile attributes to an even higher position . Social networks like Facebook1 , Sina Weibo2 , and Renren3 treat certain profiles ( gender , birthday , residence , etc . ) as mandatory information for registration . With these attributes , users are served with a personalized experience . Existing works have examined diverse data sources on social networks , validating that communication behaviors ( replying/retweeting [ 23]/ “ Likes ” [ 13] ) , linguistic characteristics of tweets [ 20 ] , group memberships [ 16 ] and friendships [ 33 ] are useful for profile inference .
However , human mobility , as a very informative and fundamental user behavior , has been overlooked by most previous works for profile inference . In fact , users’ demographic attributes are of great importance in terms of at least two conspicuous aspects : 1 ) commerce : the profile contributes significantly to link prediction , item recommendation , and targeted advertising , which are crucial for most companies ; 2 ) uses : the profile is directive for content sharing , membership attachment , and trust establishment , which are pervasive for various personalized services .
In this paper , we look into demographics inference through one of the most popular human mobility data , location check ins from online social networks . In particular , we uncover three distinct aspects embodied in the check in data that are potentially correlated with users’ profiles , namely temporality , spatiality and location knowledge .

• Temporality : Human mobility is imbued with ample temporal patterns at different granularities , eg , day of the week and time of day . For example , office staff commute from home to their company every weekday morning . It ’s common to see a retired person shopping in the supermarket on a weekday afternoon and a taxi driver working at midnight during holidays . Recent studies have also found that human mobility follows a high degree of regularity [ 12 ] . As an example , Figure 1 shows the hourly density distribution of different types of check ins from Sina Weibo ( China ’s Twitter ) based on 10,000 randomly sampled users’ check in histories , which clearly indicates different patterns for various categories of POIs , eg , the concentration of “ food ” related check ins mostly occur at noon and dinner time , while most transportation related check ins occur in the early morning .
• Spatiality : Human mobility is the manifestation of spatial variation . More specifically , the spacial scale is restricted by transportation conditions . For instance , one cannot check in at Stanford University if he has just checked in at Northeastern University only half an hour before . This makes mobility distinctive from unrestrained behaviors such as “ Liking ” , following , replying and retweeting on social networks . For example , Figure 2 presents the distance between consecutive check ins of 100,000 randomly sampled users , in which we find that a large proportion of the distance is less than 20 kilometers . As another example , we plot the density distributions of check ins by natives and non natives in Beijing and Shanghai . As is shown in Figure 3 , natives’ check ins ( Figure 3(a ) and Figure 3(c ) ) are more diverse in terms of geo spatial distribution while the non natives check ins ( Figure 3(b ) and Figure 3(d ) ) are skewed to certain scenic areas and hot spots .
• Location knowledge : Human mobility strongly correlates to the functionality of locations which motivates people to travel between different places . Apt instances are : students go to school because they acquire knowledge there ; businessmen go to a city ’s central business district because they conduct commercial affairs there ; people go to restaurant districts because they have lunch or dinner there . A check in is typically associated with a Point of Interest ( POI ) , which belongs to a certain category , eg , teaching building or shopping mall . Furthermore , the semantics of a location sometimes contain far more information than just the category , eg , the atmosphere and price range of a restaurant , or the quality of a college.TThese semantics can be enriched with “ human knowledge ” which are revealed from customer review sites ( such as Yelp4 and Dianping5 ) and online social networks ( when users mention these locations ) .
Based on these factors , we propose a location to profile ( L2P ) framework for inferring demographic attributes of online users including gender , age , education background , sexual orientation , marital status , blood type and zodiac sign . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first work focusing on inference of demographic attributes through location check ins . On the whole , this paper offers the followings contributions :
• We exploit the semantics of user location check ins from three points of views , ie spatiality , temporality and location knowledge . In particular , we conflate Points of Interest ( POIs ) of Sina Weibo with Dianping ( a review site known as China ’s Yelp ) and explicitly learn the location knowledge of a POI from various aspects such as categories , reviews and keywords .
• We propose an L2P framework , incorporating spatiality , temporality , location knowledge features with a tensor model so as to in

• Based on a large dataset collected from Sina Weibo , we have conducted extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed feature and framework . The results show that our approach significantly outperforms baseline models in terms of multiple metrics such as precision , recall , F measure and area under curve ( AUC ) .
The rest of this paper is structured as follows : Section 2 introduces the experimental dataset and demographic attributes . The L2P framework is proposed in Section 3 . Experimental results based on a large scale dataset are presented in Section 4 . Related work is reviewed in Section 5 and the paper is concluded in Section 6 with a brief discussion of limitations and directions of future research .
2 . DATASET AND DEMOGRAPHICS
In this section , we introduce the collected dataset of user profiles and location check ins , and devise a method for generating ground truth data that is used to train and validate the performance of our inference model .
2.1 Dataset
In order to investigate and evaluate the performance of our inference framework , we crawled 3,354,918 users’ profiles on Sina Weibo whose residential cities are provided as “ Beijing ” or “ Shanghai ” ( two metropolitan cities in China ) from Sina Weibo using the LifeSpec data platform [ 32 ] . The profile information also contains user ID , nickname , number of followers and followees , gender , birthday , education background , sexual orientation , marital status , blood type , zodiac , etc .
Additionally , we crawled 81 , 781 , 544 location check ins of these users in the two cities through Sina Weibo API6 . Check in records include check in time , identity of the checked in POI , and information of the POI ( eg POI name , latitude , longitude , province , city and category , where the category follows a taxonomy 7 ) .
We note that all data we collected ( including profile attributes and check ins ) is either through Open API or publicly available on Sina Weibo , ie , no private data is used in the experiment .
2.2 Ground Truth Construction
To build a standard ground truth for our dataset , we are faced with several challenges . For one , out of privacy and safety concerns , some people tend to provide incomplete or even misleading

86.26 % 2.66 % 1.68 % 9.40 % profile information like gender and birthday . For another , nowadays , online social networks have many latent commercial zombie users with fake profiles . In order to address the above problems , we only consider verified accounts , since Sina corporation conducts manual verifications of these users ( users are asked to submit officially authenticated materials such as copies of their ID cards and employment certificates ) so as to make sure that these accounts provide real and authentic profile information .
Two matters should be noted : 1 ) verified users consist of a portion of celebrities , eg famous singer Taylor Swift and tech entrepreneur Bill Gates . 2 ) Sina corporation cannot inspect two subjective attributes , ie sexual orientation and marital status . For the former issue , we implement an auxiliary filter on the measurement of the number of followers of each user . Based on our finding , this approach effectively excludes celebrities , making our dataset more representative . For the latter issue , it is convinced that most normal users have the freedom not to offer these subjective attributes , but actually have no incentive to provide fake information .
As a result , we obtain 159 , 530 verified users ( 117 , 413 Beijing users and 42 , 117 Shanghai users ) with both their profiles and check in histories . Compared to many existing manually labeled experimental datasets [ 20 , 23 , 16 ] , our approach generates a larger scale and more reliable dataset .
2.3 Demographics Description
Table 1 presents the completion rate ( ratio of effective users ) as well as the categories of different demographic attributes for the collected users . As is shown , most users provide their gender information , and a large portion of the users provide age , educational background and zodiac sign . Here , the raw educational attribute is provided as the name of universities or schools . For the sake

Figure 4 : The Location to Profile ( L2P ) framework
Figure 5 : Region segmentation for spatiality of simplicity , we categorize it into two types : university and nonuniversity for users who provide educational attributes . For marital status , we consider four statuses that have a dominant number of users in our dataset , while the others like divorced , widowed , separated , engaged etc . are excluded . Within the users who provide gender attributes , 45.81 % are males , and 54.19 % are females . Table 2 offers more statistics with respect to other attributes such as marital status , blood type , and sexual orientation .
3 . LOCATION TO PROFILE ( L2P )
In this section , we describe the location to profile ( L2P ) framework , which aims to predict a given users’ demographic attributes based on his/her location check ins . As illustrated in Figure 4 , our proposed framework consists of four modules :
• The data crawling module accumulates user profiles and location check ins with corresponding POI information on Sina Weibo and crawl customer reviews from Dianping .
• The feature extraction module extracts rich features from location check ins of a given user in terms of spatiality , temporality and location knowledge , where the location knowledge is enriched with signals from both online review sites and social media , as detailed later in Section 3.1 and Section 32
• The dimension reduction module incorporates the extracted features of users with a tensor model and performs tensor factorization to reduce the dimensionality of features , as demonstrated in Section 331
• The inference module reduces the profile inference task to various classification and regression tasks and provides the final inference result , as detailed in Section 332
3.1 Spatiality and Temporality
311 Spatiality
As indicated in Section 1 , location check ins are not uniformly distributed in the geo spatial space . For a common person , his/her range of movement is mostly concentrated on several hubs like home , workplace , relatives’ homes , etc . In addition , some businesses tend to be located in some concentrated areas , eg , financial districts , high tech districts and restaurant streets . Hence , people who frequently appear in these areas may exhibit similar demographic attributes .
To capture the spatial distributions of users’ check ins , we segment a city into disjointed regions . Each check in of a user is assigned to the region that the check in occurs in . Nevertheless , instead of using a uniform segmentation ( grids ) for a city , we adopt a morphological segmentation of urban spaces [ 31 ] , where the regions are segmented using high level roads in a road network . Since transportation in urban areas is usually restricted by networks , such segmentation preserves the semantics of users’ movements and the topology of road networks . Figures 5(a ) and Figure 5(b ) visualize the segmentation results of Beijing and Shanghai , where the segmented regions are indicated with different colors .
312 Temporality
Human location check ins change over time during a day and a week . The underlying principle is that most people follow regular , predictable and stable patterns during their everyday lives , in spite of leading a host of different kinds of lifestyles .
Weekday and weekend patterns cover most people and nearly all kinds of jobs . Here , we split a week into two parts : weekdays and weekends . For both of them , we split a day into hourly time bins . Thus , we have a total of 24 × 2 time bins for the expression of temporal patterns . Similar to spatiality , we discretize the timestamps and assign the corresponding time bins for each check in of a user .
3.2 Location Knowledge Enrichment
Here , we converge on the methodology of enriching the knowledge of a user ’s check in location . Originally , a checked in POI is associated with some basic information , eg , the category . However , in order to predict user profiles , we need to extract more semantic and latent information for a POI . As a result , the enriched location knowledge of a given POI can be represented by a set of semantic features , such as the followings :
• Category feature . This feature shows the types and characteristics of location check ins . All POIs follow a hierarchical taxonomy defined by Sina Weibo , and each POI is associated with a code , which is a 1 1 mapping to a certain category in the taxonomy .
• Review feature . Delivering users’ interests and opinions on a POI , this feature is represented by scores of multi aspects , eg , when evaluating a restaurant , users are usually concerned with the atmosphere , service , taste and overall rating . We note that for different categories of POIs , the concerned aspects may vary .
• Keyword feature . Manifesting users’ viewpoints toward a POI , this feature is a distribution over characteristic keywords ( such as luxury , vintage , etc . ) of a check in location .

Figure 6 : Location Knowledge Enrichment
Figure 6 sketches the location knowledge enrichment process . For the category feature , it is automatically attached to POI information in the crawled location check in dataset . For learning the review and keyword features , we devise an incremental enrichment process . As is shown in Figure 6 , the “ location knowledge ” of the POIs ( indicated by the red part ) grows as the process runs step by step . Specifically , we first conflate the POIs between Sina Weibo and Dianping , which is the largest user generated review site in China . Later , we enrich the matched POIs with review features from Dianping . Next , we create a high utility keyword lexicon that contains relevant keywords for certain types of POIs ( eg , “ delicious ” is a high utility keyword for restaurants ) . Then , the keyword feature of all POIs can be derived from POI related tweets on Sina Weibo based on the created lexicon . Finally , we train classifiers and regression models to transfer the review features from the matched POIs to the remaining unmatched POIs .
We note that in the above process , we utilize user generated data such as public reviews and related tweets of a POI , however , such side information is not directly related to an individual ’s check ins , which are used as input for inferring users’ profiles .
321 Cross domain POI conflation
Dianping and Sina Weibo are heterogeneous social networks facilitating users’ different needs where Dianping is a specialized user review website while Sina Weibo is a social networking site . After crawling 2 , 699 , 822 POIs with the corresponding 29 , 326 , 863 reviews on Dianping , we devise a cross domain POI conflation approach to link Dianping POIs with Sina Weibo POIs . Specifically , we extract the name , address , telephone number , longitude and latitude for POIs collected from both Dianping and Sina Weibo . As shown in Algorithm 1 , for a pair of POIs p(i ) S ( on Sina Weibo ) and p(j ) D ( on Dianping ) , we calculate Jaccard distance ( 1 Jaccard similarity ) for name dN ( p(i ) D ) , Hamming distance for telephone number dT ( p(i ) D ) , and compute the geo distance dG(p(i ) D ) based on their latitudes and longitudes . As shown in Algorithm 1 lines 3 6 , for each Sina Weibo POI p(i ) S , we search for the POIs that are with the minimum distances in terms of different attributes ( names , addresses , telephone numbers , geo distances ) from Dianping , and verify whether these POIs are matched to p(i )
S according to several fuzzy matching rules .

By applying the fuzzy matching algorithm , 35.26 % POIs on Sina Weibo were matched to POIs on Dianping . In our practice , the thresholds in Algorithm 1 are chosen as follows : θA = θN = 0.1 , θG = 50m . To inspect the performance of the matching algorithm , we randomly sample 200 matched POIs , and manually check the correctness of the results , which achieve an accuracy of 995 % else if dN ( p(i )

/* most similar address , similar name and close

322 Lexicon creation
After the conflation of Dianping and Weibo POI , part of the Sina Weibo POIs are associated with corresponding reviews and users’ aggregated scores for multi aspects ( like environment , taste , price etc ) Thus the review features for the matched POIs are already attained ( as shown in Figure 6 where the review feature in the second phase is partially filled with red ) . The goal of this step is to create a high utility lexicon from users’ review contents on Dianping . Specifically , we conduct Chinese word segmentation to segment each review to a set of words and eliminate the stop words . Since high utility keywords for different categories of POIs may vary ( eg , “ delicious" is often used when talking about food in a restaurant , while “ king size" is usually used when talking about bed size in a hotel room ) , we categorize all POIs into several divisions as follows : travel & accommodation , buildings & institutions , campus life , restaurant & delicacy , shopping & service , life & entertainment , park & outdoors , company and others . Then for each division , we choose the top n important words as the keywords ( n is set to 200 in our implementation ) . Here , the importance of a term is defined by term frequency with a logarithmic factor which is widely used in information retrieval , given by : tfk = 1 + log(fk ) ,
( 1 ) where fk is the raw frequency of a keyword k in the reviews of a certain POI . As a result , we obtain a set of keywords for each category division , and the lexicon is merged by the keywords of all sets .
Meanwhile , we collect POI related tweets for all crawled POIs on Sina Weibo using the open API 8 . Next , for each POI ( matched or unmatched ) , we generate the keyword features by computing the distribution over the keywords in the created lexicon using the POIrelated tweets ( pre processed with Chinese word segmentation and
8http://bit.ly/1rQQZXe
299 stop words filtering ) . Hence , we obtain the keyword features for all POIs .
323 Location knowledge transferring
As indicated in Section 321 , only a fraction ( 35.26 % ) of Weibo POIs have been matched , not to mention that actually some unpopular matching POIs have vacant review scores for different aspects . Since users’ review keywords fully embody their ratings , transferring the knowledge of review keywords as ratings is intuitive . In order to obtain the review features for all collected POIs , we develop a supervised learning approach to “ transfer" the review features of matched POIs that have multi aspect review scores to the remaining POIs .
Specifically , given the keyword feature of a POI FK , the score of a certain aspect is considered a function of the keyword features , ie , ri = ri(FK ) , where i = 1 , 2 , . . . , M is the index of all review aspects ( merged from different category divisions ) and rall = rall(FK ) is the overall rating of a POI . The key insight behind this is that the multi aspect scores provided by users are typically reflected from their reviews . Thus , we utilize the matched POIs that have multi aspect review scores as the training data to learn the mapping functions {ri}M i=1 as well as the overall rating rall , where the review score is deemed as the label and the keyword feature of a POI is considered as the input feature .
We note that the score for a single review aspect is a categorical variable ( 1 , 2 , . . . , 5 ) indicated by “ stars ” and the overall rating of a POI is a continuous valued rating . Thus , we train linear kernel SVM classifiers for individual review aspects and logistic regression to learn the overall rating of a POI . We conduct a 10 fold cross validation on the POIs using the trained classiers and regression models . Then , we apply the trained models to infer the aspect scores and overall ratings for the remaining POIs that have no review features . As a result , for each POI , we obtain the review feature FR = ( r1 , r2 , . . . , rM , rall ) .
3.3 Dimension Reduction and Profile Inference
331 Dimension reduction
After feature extraction from spatiality , temporality and location knowledge aspects , we obtain a large scale feature set for users’ check ins . To reduce the dimensionality of the features and mine intrinsic representation of users , we feed the features into a threeway tensor T and conduct tensor factorization .
As shown in Figure 7 , the three ways of T ∈ RI1×I2×I3 represent users , location knowledge features and contextual features respectively , where I1 is the number of users , I2 is the dimensionality of location knowledge features and I3 is the dimensionality of the contextual features including both spatiality and temporality .
Here , in order to construct the three way tensor , Cartesian production is implemented over feature spaces within context dimension and location knowledge dimension severally . More specifically , for context dimension , given a check in corresponding to region α and time bin β , the index is determined by α × NT + β , in which NT is the number of time bins . For the dimension of location knowledge , we first cluster check ins according to review features and keyword features separately ( we employ k means clustering in our practice while other clustering methods can generally be applied ) , resulting in NR review based clusters and NK keywordbased clusters respectively . Then we flatten category , review , and keyword features using an approach similar to the context dimension . For example , assuming a user ’s check in c is associated with a POI that belongs to category α1 , cluster α2 of the NR review based clusters , and cluster α3 of the NK keyword based clusters respec r e s U U

Figure 7 : Tensor decomposition model tively , the final coordinate of c in the location knowledge dimension is given by α1 × NR × NK + α2 × NK + α3 .
Later , we employ the Tucker Decomposition technique which de composes T by :
T =S×U U×LL×C C , where S ∈ RdU ×dL×dC is the core tensor indicating interactions between user , context and location knowledge . U ∈ RI1×dU , L ∈ RI2×dL and C ∈ RI3×dC are the factor matrices considering the low dimensional representation of users , locations and contexts ( spatiality and temporality ) respectively .
The tensor model offers several advantages for dimension reduction compared to other approaches , eg , the tensor model intrinsically captures interactions between different features within various domains similar to matrix factorization . However , compared to matrix factorization , the tensor model is more suitable for high dimensional data .
332 Profile inference
Let U be the factorized user intrinsic matrix generated using the method described in Section 331 , which already incorporates users’ similar patterns in terms of spatiality , temporality , and location knowledge . By considering each row of U as the feature vector of a user and the actual demographic attribute as the label , we transform the profile inference task to several classification or regression tasks as follows . • Gender . A binary classification task classifying users’ gender : male and female . • Age : A regression task inferring the specific age , where age is a continuous valued attribute . • Education Background . A binary classification task distinguishing users’ education level : university and non university . • Sexual Orientation . A multi class classification task differentiating four kinds of sexual orientation : heterosexuality , bisexuality , male homosexuality and female homosexuality . • Marital Status . A multi class classification task predicting four kinds of marital status : single , courtship , in love and married . • Blood Type . A multi class classification task identifying four common blood types : O , A , B and AB . • Zodiac : A multi class classification task demarcating twelve zodiac signs .
Over the last several decades , various algorithms have been proposed for learning classification and regression functions . We evaluate a number of well adopted learning algorithms to learn the models separately and examine their performance in the experiments . Specifically , for binary classification tasks , we compare logistic regression , SVM , and LambdaMART [ 28 ] ; for regression tasks ,
300 we try models such as linear regression , Poisson regression , and boosted tree regression [ 9 ] ; for multi class classification , we evaluate multi class logistic regression , multi class neuron networks [ 19 ] , and a parallel ensemble method [ 24 ] ( refer to Section 4 for the results ) .
4 . EXPERIMENTS
4.1 Settings
411 Preliminary
Our experiments are guided by the following considerations : 1 ) Whether location check ins have predictive power for demographic attributes ; 2 ) Whether all the proposed features ( spatiality , temporality and location knowledge ) contribute to the performance of inferring demographic attributes ; and 3 ) How well the proposed L2P framework applies to different demographic attributes .
With the purpose of testing the generality and robustness of our L2P framwork , we perform experiments on Beijing and Shanghai separately . For each city , we conducted a 10 fold cross validation for inferring each demographic attribute . For the profile inference procedure ( introduced in Section 332 ) , we used 6 parts for training , 2 parts for validation , and the remaining 2 parts for testing if not specified elsewhere ( we also study the effect of varying the ratio of training data in the experiments ) . The validation set was used to tune the hyper parameters of the learning algorithms , such as the number of trees in LambdaMART , and then we fixed the parameters to train the models using the training set . The test set was used to evaluate the performance of the trained models . Note that all the reported results are the average performances over the 10 trials .
For the parameters , we set n = 200 for choosing the top n keywords in lexicon creation ( Section 322 ) In the procedure of location knowledge transferring ( Section 323 ) , NR and NK are set to 100 by default , and dU is set to 200 by default if not specified elsewhere in Section 42 The effect of different NR , NK , and dU are studied later in the experiments .
412 Baselines
To the best of our knowledge , there exists no model directly predicting user demographics from human location check ins . We then compare our method with the following baselines . Here , by analogizing a POI as a “ Like ” , we compare our approach against a recently famous profile inference method proposed by Kosinski et al . [ 13 ] , which extracts principle components from the UserPOI matrix and performs logistic/linear regression based on the derived user feature vector . We refer to this baseline as the POIbased method ( shortened as POI method ) . We term our approach that comprehensively considers spatiality , temporality , and location knowledge as the STL method , and further evaluate the following baselines for comparison .
• Spatiality based method ( S ) , which only considers the spatial information in the tensor ( degenerated as a matrix ) , and performs profile inference using extracted user features similar to the STL method .
• Spatiality and Temporality based method ( ST ) , which goes one step further than S , leveraging both the spatial and temporal features in the tensor for prediction .
• Spatiality , Temporality , and Category based method ( STC ) , which adopts spatial , temporal and category features in the tensor for prediction , ie , without location knowledge enrichment as in the STL method .
413 Criteria
We evaluate the results using the following measurements in terms of different inference tasks . Effective and common metrics for binary classification such as precision , recall , F measure and Area Under the ROC Curve ( AUC ) are all evaluated . For multi class classification , average precision ( over different classes ) , average recall , and average F measure are employed . We use RMSE ( Root MeanSquare Error ) for examining the performance of regression models .
4.2 Results
421 Gender
Table 3 presents the results of gender inference for users in Beijing and Shanghai . As is shown in Table 3(a ) , the STL method achieves the best performance in terms of all measurements , where the F1 score is above 0.8 for both Beijing and Shanghai users , which significantly outperforms competing methods . In particular , the STL method , which considers the complement set of location knowledge features , gains more than 0.05 improvement over the STC method and 0.1 improvement over the POI method in terms of AUC for both Beijing and Shanghai users . This indicates that the location semantics , particularly , the review and keyword features learned from different domains , contribute a lot to the predictive power of the STL method .
We further study the performance of different learning algorithms ( Section 332 ) for gender inference , and the dimensions of user intrinsic matrix dU in tensor factorization ( Section 331 ) for the STL method . Figure 8 illustrates the AUC for SVM ( linear kernel ) , LR and LambdaMart classifiers . As is shown , the LambdaMART classifier performs the best over other classifiers . As the number of dimensions dU increases from 50 to 200 , the results of all classifiers improve and tend to be stable when dU = 300 , then decrease when dU further increases .

422 Age
Age inference is considered a regression task . Figure 9 plots the RMSE of all compared methods when changing the ratio of training data . As is shown , the STL method and POI method perform better than other methods for age inference , but STL still outperforms the POI method . For example , when we use only 15 % data for training , the RMSE of the STL method is less than 5 , which is a significant improvement over the POI method . Table 4 gives the results of different regression models for STL , where the boosted tree regression model achieves the best performance .

423 Education background
The results of education background inference are presented in Table 5 . Surprisingly , the inference results of all methods are remarkably higher than gender and age , which indicate that users’ education levels are highly predictable from their physical movements . For example , the AUC of STL method for Beijing users is higher than 09 Meanwhile , we study the effect of NK ( number of keyword based clusters ) and NR ( number of review based clusters ) for dimension reduction in location knowledge enrichment . As shown in Table 6 , the performance is comparatively stable for different settings of NR and NK .

Sexual orientation and marital status
Table 7 presents the evaluation results for inferring sexual orientation and marital status . Here , due to space limit , we report the overall results for Beijing and Shanghai users , and based on the best performed parallel ensemble classifier . We note that for both sexual orientation and marital status , the inference problem is reduced as a 4 class classification task . Although the performance is not as strong as the gender/education inference , the STL method still outperforms other methods in terms of all measurements , and for all compared methods the results of sexual orientation inference are better than marital status .
425 Blood type and zodiac sign
We note that for blood type and zodiac inference , which have rarely been considered in existing literatures our work is rather initiatory and purely driven by curiosity . As is shown in Table 8 , the location check ins show weak predictive power for these attributes .
Remark : From the above inference results , we can discover that gender and education attributes achieve the best results because they are highly predictable from check in records and the binary classification is relatively easy . Considering the identification of sexual

POI
S ST STC STL orientation and marital status , since they are multi class classification tasks and the attribute completion rate is very low , the prediction is not as good as gender and education . Careful scrutiny reaveals that sexual orientation inference is better than that of marital status , because sexual orientation ( such as bisexuality and homosexuality ) is more distinctive than marital status ( such as single and courtship ) . The performances of blood type and zodiac sign are the weakest among all the demographics , indicating that they are merely predictable from human location check in records . However , we should note that our model still perfoms much better than random guess . As is shown in the above prediction tasks , an ascending order of the predictive power for the compared methods are S , POI , ST , STC and STL . Spatial feature , which is extracted based on road networks in coarse granularity , leads to weaker performance than POI . On the basis of spatiality ( S ) , we iteratively add tempo
302 raility ( ST ) , category ( STC ) , and location knowledge ( STL ) , making the feature more sophisticated step by step . ST and STC baselines , which convey temporal patterns , result in enhanced achievements over spatiality based methods ( S and POI ) , where the STC method partially considers location knowledge from the category information of a POI . The STL method , which incorporates more location knowledge transfered from review sites , gains the most remarkable improvement against all other baselines .
5 . RELATED WORK
5.1 Inferences of Demographic Attributes
Demographics inference has been studied in academia for more than fifty years . Several early stage works have researched author identification [ 17 ] and gender discrimination [ 14 , 26 ] . In 1992 , Costa Jr and McCrae [ 8 ] predicted demographic attributes and personalities through people ’s answers to a specific psychometric test . [ 11 ] adopted psychological approach and analyzed testers’ written words to classify their personality type .
The proliferation of digital communication and Internet brought a brand new opportunity for inferring demographic attributes . With a concentration on differences in gender sociolinguistics , Boulis and Ostendorf [ 5 ] studied users’ telephone conversation data and predicted gender attributes using machine learning techniques . Murray and Durrell [ 18 ] adopted LSA to analyze users’ browsing behavior for demographic attributes classification . Back et al . [ 3 ] predicted personality , ie neuroticism , openness , agreeableness , conscientiousness , narcissism , and extroversion solely from email addresses . In recent years , the fast development of online social networks and mobile computing technologies have provided researchers with a convenient way to infer people ’s demographic attributes . Kosinski et al . [ 13 ] employed Facebook “ Likes ” data , SVD dimension reduction technique and logistic regression to predict private traits and attributes . Pennacchiotti and Popescu [ 20 ] put forward a machine learning framework to detect users’ political affiliation , ethnicity identification , and business affinity . Brdar et al . [ 6 ] proposed a multi level classification model to predict people ’s attributes like gender , age , marital status , and job type , among others .
Our work differs from existing approaches in that we focus on users’ location check in data from online social networks for demographic inference , which has rarely been explored before .
5.2 Location Understanding
Existing approaches on enriching location knowledge can be categorized in terms of different data sources : GPS trace , Web and location based social networks ( LBSN ) , and Volunteered Geographic Information ( VGI ) .
• GPS trace : A myriad of scholars have carefully researched into location knowledge extraction from GPS traces [ 7 , 15 ] . They employed and devised different methods for mining and extracting semantically important locations .
• Web : An early location semantics study [ 21 ] addressed the deficiency of traditional physical/geographical location presentation by linking location to an unambiguous “ web like ” URI . Focusing on location extraction from web contextual information , Qin et al . [ 22 ] proposed a detection ranking framework and addressed challenges in location name detection and location entity disambiguation . Wang et al . [ 27 ] proposed a generative model to learn latent aspect ratings from online reviews , demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed model using data from a hotel review site .
• LBSN and VGI : Recently , several works have been proposed on location knowledge mining in LBSN and VGI . Ye et al . [ 30 ] de veloped techniques for location semantic annotation by extracting features of places from explicit patterns ( EP ) and implicit relatedness and learning SVM to support multi label classification . [ 21 ] and [ 29 ] respectively presented methodologies to analyze spatial and temporal dimension semantics of POI from LBSN and VGI .
Our location knowledge enrichment is distinctive from existing works in the following ways : 1 ) We enrich the understanding of a POI by transferring location knowledge from heterogeneous domains , after conflating POIs between an online customer review site and an online social network ; 2 ) We explicitly model three types of location knowledge , namely category features , review features , and keyword features , where review features and keyword features are learned from heterogeneous user generated data ( online reviews and POI related tweets ) .
5.3 Tensor factorization
Tensor factorization is widely applied in a variety of areas . The first application in data mining is [ 1 ] in 2005 , focusing on chat room tensor construction and factorization techniques performance comparisons . Later in text analysis , Bader et al . [ 4 ] developed nonnegative tensor factorization to extract discussions from email communications and proved the superiority of nonnegative matrix factorization . The application of tensor factorization on recommendation and prediction is also carefully studied in several works [ 2 , 25 ] where Acar et al . [ 2 ] explored matrix and tensor factorization models in temporal link prediction and Symeonidis et al . [ 25 ] proposed a unified framework modeling 3 order tensor , user , item and tag .
To the best of our knowledge , our work is the first to apply tensor factorization for profile inference in real world online social networks where features are organized in a three way tensor , which consists of user , context ( spatiality and temporality ) and location knowledge .
6 . CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSIONS
In this paper , we have addressed the problem of demographics inference from location check ins , and developed a comprehensive L2P framework to capture temporality , spatiality and location knowledge at the same time . Extensive experiments based on our large scale Sina Weibo dataset have validated the effectiveness of the proposed methods for inferring a variety of demographic attributes .
Although this is , to our best knowledge , the first work that explores demographic inference from location check ins , the proposed methodology is far from perfect and may suffer from several limitations . For example , our experiments are based on a dataset with users who use online social networks and post check ins , which may not be a representative sample set of the whole targeted population . Another issue is the profiles of users who live in metropolitan cities ( Beijing and Shanghai in our dataset ) may create bias in the inference result . However , we believe that the proposed L2P framework is general enough to be applied on other forms of human mobility data with a finer granularity and larger coverage , eg , GPS traces collected from phones .
There are many directions that can be further explored to improve the current L2P framework . For one thing , location check ins may suffer from data sparsity for representing human mobility , given that few people are willing to post locations all the time . One possible solution may come from extracting POI level locations from a large quantity of normal tweets , like “ I am shopping with my daughter at Walmart in LA! ” . It is also possible that other signals could be integrated into the L2P framework , eg , the current model has not exploited users’ friendship relations on social networks , which might affect users’ check in behaviors .
