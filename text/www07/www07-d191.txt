ABSTRACT Researchers of commercial search engines often collect data using the application programming interface ( API ) or by “ scraping ” results from the web user interface ( WUI ) , but anecdotal evidence suggests the interfaces produce different results . We provide the first in depth quantitative analysis of the results produced by the Google , MSN and Yahoo API and WUI interfaces . After submitting a variety of queries to the interfaces for 5 months , we found significant discrepancies in several categories . Our findings suggest that the API indexes are not older , but they are probably smaller for Google and Yahoo . Researchers may use our findings to better understand the differences between the interfaces and choose the best API for their particular types of queries .

INTRODUCTION
In recent years , Google , MSN and Yahoo have developed freely available APIs for accessing their index , allowing researchers to more easily automate the data collection process and avoid breaking the stated policies of search engines that prohibit automated queries against their WUIs . Unfortunately , the APIs do not always give the same results as the WUIs . The listserves and newsgroups that cater to the API communities are full of questions regarding the perceived differences in results between the two , and only one limited study [ 4 ] we are aware of attempts to address the issue ( only for the Google API ) .
Since none of the search engines publicly disclose the inner workings of their APIs , researchers are left wondering if the APIs are giving second rate data . For example , BarYossef and Gurevich [ 2 ] discount their findings , stating their

The purpose of this study was to test these assumptions .
2 . EXPERIMENT
Every day for five months ( late May to Oct 2006 ) we sub mitted four types of queries ( 3500 total ) to each interface :
1 . General search terms . We queried for the top 100 results and the total number of results using 50 popular search terms1 and 50 computer science ( CS ) terms2 .
2 . URL backlinks . We queried for the number of back links to 100 randomly selected URLs .
3 . Pages indexed for a website . We asked how many pages were indexed for 100 randomly selected websites .
4 . URL indexing and caching . We queried to see if
100 randomly selected URLs were indexed and/or cached .
We used three distance measures to compare the top search results for our popular and CS terms : overlap P , Kendall tau for top k lists K [ 3 ] , and measure M [ 1 ] . Each measure was normalized so 1 meant complete agreement and 0 complete disagreement . P only penalizes for non shared results , but K additionally penalizes for results that are out of position . M penalizes changes in the top of the list more heavily than changes at the bottom ( since humans typically examine the top results more often than the bottom ones ) . We refer the reader to the cited works for formal definitions . We initially compared WUI results from day n to day n−1 and API results from day n to day n − 1 and found a great amount of fluctuation . The interfaces tended to change at the same rate each day for most terms , but we found several popular term results like carmen electra and jessica simpson that appeared to change at very different rates in both of Google ’s interfaces . We did not observe this phenomena in Yahoo and MSN . The K means of both interfaces for Google , MSN and Yahoo were 0.94 , 0.94 and 0.95 , respectively .
Comparing the WUI and API results each day , we see a great deal of variation ( Figure 1)3 . M appears significantly lower than the other measures when examining Google ’s results for both popular and CS terms and for MSN popular terms , suggesting that Google ’s and MSN ’s top results are the most significantly different between their interfaces . Google ’s distance measures are all significantly higher for 1http://50lycoscom/ 2http://enwikipediaorg/wiki/List of cs topics 3The MSN gap was due to MSN invalidating our API key by mistake for 17 days .

CS terms than popular terms , but the reverse is true for Yahoo ( two sample Wilcoxon signed rank test , p < 0001 ) These differences may be explained by how Google and Yahoo treat web spam . Averaging the distance measures together , Google ’s and Yahoo ’s API results are 14 % different than the WUI results , and MSN is 7 % different .
We tested to see if the API index was older ( or newer ) than the WUI index by comparing API results from day n to WUI results on day n ± 1 , n ± 2 , etc . For all three search engines , we found the highest correlation on day n . Therefore the API indexes are not older or newer .
We examined the number of times the interfaces produced top k results that were identical in rank ( K = 1 ) or in set membership ( P = 1 ) . Google never produced identically ranked top 100 results , and MSN and Yahoo did only slightly better ( 02 % ) For top 10 results , MSN ( 38 % ) and Yahoo ( 32 % ) improve considerably , but Google only slightly ( 4% ) . There is only modest improvement of 3 6 % by all of the search engines when we disregard ranking .
When we examined the total results , backlinks and pages indexed , we rarely saw exact agreement , so we examined loose disagreements , when the API value is greater than or less than ± 10 % of the WUI value . We summarize our findings in Table 1 . Responses to the URL indexing and caching queries resulted in far more consistent interface responses for all search engines ; Google disagreed only 1.0 % of the time , MSN 1.1 % and Yahoo 68 %
3 . CONCLUSIONS
Researchers should expect that the results obtained through any search engine ’s API will rarely be identical to what the general WUI user sees . This especially impacts applications where recall is important . But some APIs perform better in certain categories as we have summarized in Table 2 . MSN appears to have the most synchronized interfaces overall .

We have shown that all three search engines provide nearly synchronized changes in their results each day , and the API results are most similar to the WUI results on the same day . Therefore we conclude that the APIs are not serving from an older index . It is possible though that Google and Yahoo are serving from a smaller index ; both WUIs consistently report total results that are higher than the APIs ( of course we cannot directly verify these estimates , and Google adds ‘supplemental results’ to their WUI results ) . Yahoo ’s WUI consistently reports larger backlink counts , and Google ’s WUI consistently reports larger website page counts . To give a more definitive answer , we suggest a future experiment that randomly samples from each corpus and compares the overlap [ 2 ] .
On December 20 , 2006 , Google announced they were beginning to deprecate their SOAP API in favor of an AJAX API , a move which may require researchers to readopt old screen scraping methods . Despite this setback , it is our hope that commercial search engines will make a committed effort to provide more synchronized interfaces for the academic community in the future .
