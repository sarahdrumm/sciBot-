ABSTRACT Web pages are more than text and they contain much contextual and structural information , eg , the title , the meta data , the anchor text , etc . , each of which can be seen as a data source or a representation . Due to the different dimensionality and different representing forms of these heterogeneous data sources , simply putting them together would not greatly enhance the classification performance . We observe that via a kernel function , different dimensions and types of data sources can be represented into a common format of kernel matrix , which can be seen as a generalized similarity measure between a pair of web pages . In this sense , a kernel learning approach is employed to fuse these heterogeneous data sources . The experimental results on a collection of the ODP database validate the advantages of the proposed method over traditional methods based on any single data source and the uniformly weighted combination of them .

INTRODUCTION
With the rapid growth of web pages of the World Wide Web , web page classification has become more and more important in both research and applications . Many researchers have explored content based and context based data sources , such as the text , the meta data , the anchor texts , and the titles , for the web pages classification [ 2 , 6 , 5 ] . Although the combination of some data sources is able to improve the web pages categorization performance , there is still a lack of effective and systematic strategies of combining different data sources . In the previous work , the weights for different data sources are usually set manually and the data sources are usually put together to form a large data file . Due to the

To solve this problem , this paper proposes a heterogeneous web page classification framework . First , these heterogeneous data sources are extracted from web pages . Via a kernel function , each data source is represented as a common format of a kernel matrix , which can be seen as the generalized similarity matrix defined among all pairs of pages . Then , the fusion of heterogeneous data sources is formulated as the combination of the kernel matrices . Exploiting Quadric Constrained Quadratic Programming ( QCQP ) techniques , the fusion process is reduced to a convex optimization problem . Last , the fused kernel matrix will be employed by a kernel based classification algorithm .
2 . RELATED WORK
Web page classification has been widely studied in the past few years . The simplest approach for web page classification is only using the text features . However , web pages are more than texts , and they contain a lot of context and structural information , eg , links , anchor texts , URLs , etc . [ 2 ] proposed robust statistical models by exploiting link information in a small neighborhood around documents . [ 1 ] found that the combination of the anchor text and the plain text got better accuracy . [ 3 ] found that meta data is a useful source of information and the combination of meta data with text can result in better performance . [ 6 ] claimed that the combination of the plain text , the anchor text and the title can get a large improvement on F1 measure compared with full text .
3 . WEB PAGE CLASSIFICATION WITH HET
EROGENEOUS DATA FUSION
We acquire each data source by extracting one of the following features : the plain text ( PT ) , the title ( TI ) , the meta data ( MT ) , the text from the inlink pages ( LT ) and the anchor text ( AT ) . When the features are extracted from web pages , kernel matrices can be built . combination , ie , K =Pm
We use θi to represent the weight of the i th input source . After each data source is represent as a kernel matrix Ki , the fused kernel matrix can be represented by their linear i=1 Ki . We note the kernel matrix built on the training data points as K tr i . In the following , the kernel combination parameters θi and the parameters of kernel SVM are optimized at the same time .
Substitute K tr =Pm
SVM , the optimization problem can be formulated as [ 4 ] : i=1 K tr i into the dual form of kernel mX i=1 max
α st
αT e − 1 2 mX trace(
θiK tr i ) = δ ,
αT D(y)(
θiK tr i )D(y)α
( 1 ) nX i=1
αT y = 0 , 0 ≤ αi ≤ C , 1 ≤ i ≤ n , where δ is a constant and D(y ) is the diagonal matrix of y . In this paper , the weighting vector θ is constrained to be nonnegative . Thus the nonnegative combination of Ki will assure the positive semidefiniteness of K , since Ki is positive semidefinite .
It can be proved that the above problem can be trans formed as follows max α,t st

This is a Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program ( QCQP ) . Thus the discriminant function can be directly written as : f ( z ) = yiαiK(xi , z ) ,
( 3 ) i=1 where z can be a test data point .
Remark . When all kernel matrices are formulated as linear kernel matrices , finding coefficients to combine the data sources is directly equivalent to selecting coefficients to combine the kernel matrices built on heterogeneous data sources .
4 . EXPERIMENTS
In this section , experiments are conducted to compare the effects of the single data sources , the universally weighted combination of them ( UW ) , and the combinations based on kernel learning and convex optimization ( KC ) on web page classification .
Data Set The Open Directory Project database ( ODP ) is used for web page classification , because it provides more structural information and meta information for the web page classification . Three categories ( with the size of 409 , 546 , and 402 , respectively ) under the “ home ” directory of the ODP database are selected as the test bed .
Experimental Protocols We conduct 10 trials . In each trial , a modified 5 fold cross validation is used to evaluate the performance , ie , 1 fold is used for training and 4 fold for test in each cross . The parameters of SVM are tuned by cross validation . The trace of combined kernel matrix is set to n , the number of web pages . The F1 metric is employed to evaluate the prediction performance of different classifiers for each category . To balance the performance measures across multi categories , two kinds of average measures of F1 are considered , ie , micro F1 and macro F1 , where micro F1 gives equal weights to each document and macro F1 gives equal weights to each category .

It can be observed from Table 1 that KC achieves the best classification performance on both the micro F1 measure and the macro F1 measure . More specifically , KC improves by about 14 % over UW on the micro F1 measure , and 15 % on the macro F1 . This is because the combination coefficients can be optimized to deal with the situation that heterogeneous data sources differ greatly in prediction performance .
5 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , a statistical web page classification approach is proposed , which incorporates heterogeneous data sources extracted from web pages and formulates them into a common format of kernel matrix . Via kernel combination and convex optimization techniques , a new kernel matrix by fusing different kernel matrices can be provided to kernelbased web page classifiers . The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of this combination technique on one collection of the ODP database .
