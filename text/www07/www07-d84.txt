ABSTRACT The primary function of current Web search engines is essentially relevance ranking at the document level . However , myriad structured information about real world objects is embedded in static Web pages and online Web databases . Document level information retrieval can unfortunately lead to highly inaccurate relevance ranking in answering object oriented queries . In this paper , we propose a paradigm shift to enable searching at the object retrieval models , documents are taken as the retrieval units and the content of a document this reliability assumption is no longer valid in the object retrieval context when multiple copies of information about the same object typically exist . These copies may be inconsistent because of diversity of Web site qualities and the limited performance of current information extraction techniques . If we simply combine the noisy and inaccurate attribute information extracted from different sources , we may not be able to achieve satisfactory retrieval performance . In this paper , we propose several language models for Web object retrieval , namely an unstructured object retrieval model , a structured object retrieval model , and a hybrid model with both structured and unstructured retrieval features . We test these models on a paper search engine and compare their performances . We conclude that the hybrid model is the superior by taking into account the extraction errors at varying levels .

1 . INTRODUCTION The primary function of current Web search engines is essentially relevance ranking at in information retrieval for more than 25 years [ 1 ] . However , there are various kinds of objects embedded in static Web pages or Web databases . Typical objects are people , products , papers , organizations , etc . We can imagine that if these objects can be extracted and integrated from the Web , powerful object level search engines can be built to meet users' information needs more precisely , especially for some specific domains [ 26 ] . For example , in project our Windows

( http://productslivecom ) , we automatically extract a large set of product objects from Web data sources [ 38 ] , when users search for a specific product , one can acquire a list of relevant product objects with clear information such as name , image , price , and features . We have been developing another object level vertical search system call Libra Academic Search ( http://libramsracn ) to help researchers and students locate information for scientific papers , authors , conferences , and journals . With the concept of Web objects , the search results of Libra could be a list of papers with explicit title , author , and conference proceedings . Such results are obviously more appealing than a list of URLS , which costs user ’s significant efforts to decipher for needed information . We believe object level Web search is particularly necessary in building vertical Web search engines such as product search , people search , scientific Web search , job search , community search , and so on . Such a perspective has led to significant research community interest , while related technologies such as data record extraction [ 21][32][22 ] , attribute value extraction[37 ] , and object identification on the Web [ 31 ] have been developed in recent years . These techniques have made it possible for us to extract and integrate all related Web information about the same object together as an information unit . We call these Web information units Web objects . Currently , little work has been done in retrieving and ranking relevant Web objects to answer user queries .
In this paper , we focus on exploring suitable models for retrieving Web objects . There are two direct categories of candidate models for object retrieval . The first is comprised of the traditional document retrieval models , in which all contents in an object are merged and treated as a text document . The other is made up of structured document retrieval models , where an object can be viewed as a structured document and the object attributes as different document representations , with relevance calculated by combining scores of different representations . We argue that simply applying both of these two categories of models on Web object retrieval does not achieve satisfactory ranking results . In traditional IR models , documents are taken as the retrieval units and the content of documents are considered reliable . However , the reliability assumption is no longer valid in the object retrieval context . There are several possible routes to introduce errors in object contents during the process of object extraction :
•
Source level error : Since the quality of Web sources can vary significantly , some information about an object in some sources may be simply wrong .
• Record level error : Due to the huge number of Web sources , automatic approaches are commonly used to locate and extract the data records from Web pages or Web databases [ 22 ] . It is inevitable that the record extraction ( ie detection ) process will introduce additional errors . The extracted records may miss some key information or include some irrelevant information , or both .
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Identifying Structure in Web Pages81 • Attribute level error : Even if the Web source is reliable and the object contents are correctly detected , the description of an object ( ie object element labeling ) may be still wrong because of incorrect attribute value extraction . For example , it is very common to label a product name by brand , or vice versa . In Citeseer , we also usually find that author names are concatenated to paper titles , or some author names are missing . representation . We
Although [ 38 ] proposed a model which combined the record and attribute extraction processes , it may also bring both record and attribute level error which are similar to other technique . In this paper , we focus on this unreliability problem in Web object retrieval . Our basic ideas are based on two principles . First , as described above , errors can be introduced in both the record level and attribute level . Moreover , as errors will be propagated along the extraction process , the accuracy of attribute extraction is surely lower than that of record extraction . However , separating record contents into multiple attributes will bring more information than just treating all contents in a record as a unit . Therefore , it is desirable to combine both record level representation and attribute level combing representations of multiple levels , our method is insensitive to extraction accuracy . Second , multiple copies of information about the same object usually exist . These copies may be inconsistent because of diverse Web site qualities and the limited performance of current information extraction techniques . If we simply combine the noisy and inaccurate object information extracted from different sources , we will not be able to achieve satisfactory ranking results . Therefore , we need to distinguish the quality of the records and attributes from different sources and trust data of high reliability more and data of low reliability less . We hope that even when data from some sites have low reliability , we can still get good retrieval performance if some copies of the objects have higher reliability . In other words , our method should also take advantage of multiple copies of one object to achieve stable performance despite varying qualities of the copies . hope , by
2.1 Web Objects and Object Extraction We define the concept of Web Objects as the principle data units about which Web information is to be collected , indexed , and ranked . Web objects are usually recognizable concepts , such as authors , papers , conferences , or journals that have relevance to the application domain . A Web object is generally represented by a set . The attribute set for a specific of attributes
A =

,{ aa 1
2 object type is predefined based on the requirements in the domain .
If we start to think of a user information need or a topic to search on the Web as a form of Web Object , the search engine will need to address at least the following technical issues in order to provide intelligent search results to the user :
• Object level Information Extraction – A Web object is constructed by collecting related data records extracted from multiple Web sources . The sources for holding object information could be HTML pages , documents put on the Web ( eg PDF , PS , Word , and other formats. ) , and deep contents hidden in Web databases . Figure 1 illustrates six data records embedded in a Web page and six attributes from a records . There is already extensive research to explore algorithms for extraction of objects from Web sources ( more discussion about the diversity of sources is to come . )
• Object Identification and Integration – Each extracted instance of a Web object needs to be mapped to a real world object and stored into the Web data warehouse . To do so , we need techniques to integrate information about the same object and disambiguate different objects .
• Web object retrieval – After information extraction and integration , we should provide retrieval mechanism to satisfy users’ information needs . Basically , the retrieval should be conducted at the object level , which means that the extracted objects should be indexed and ranked against user queries .
Based on the above arguments , our goal is to design retrieval models insensitive to data errors and that can achieve stable performance for data with varying extraction accuracies . Specifically , we propose several language models for Web object retrieval , namely an unstructured object retrieval model , a structured object retrieval model , and a hybrid model with both structured and unstructured retrieval features . We test these models on a paper search engine and compare their performance . We conclude that the best model is the one combining both objectlevel and attribute level evidence and taking into account of the errors at different levels .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . First , we define the Web object information retrieval problem . In Section 3 , we introduce the models for Web object retrieval . In Section 4 , we use a scientific Web search engine further motivate the need for object level Web search and its advantages and challenges over existing search engines . After that , we report our experimental results in Section 5 . Finally , we discuss related work in Section 6 . Section 7 states our conclusions .
2 . BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM DEFINITION In this section , we first introduce the concept of Web objects and object extraction . We then define the Web object retrieval problem .
Figure 1 . Six Data Records in a Web Page and Six Attributes from a Record
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Identifying Structure in Web Pages82 Figure 2 shows the compounds of a Web object and a flowchart to extract the object from Web sources . The key messages conveyed by the figure are :
1 . The contents of a Web object are aggregated from multiple Web sources . These copies may be inconsistent because of the diverse Web site qualities and the limited performance of current information extraction techniques .
2 . From each source , two steps are taken to extract the wanted information . First , record extraction [ 21][32][22 ] is applied to get data records relevant to the domain from the resource . Second , attribute extraction [ 37 ] is used to label different portions of each extracted record as different attributes . Both of the two steps are unlikely to be accurate . Record extraction can extract a totally wrong record , miss some parts of a record , or add irrelevant information to a record . Attribute extraction may wrongly label an attribute or not identify an attribute . But , in practice , the accuracy of every extraction algorithm on each Web source can be reasonably measured by using some test dataset . Therefore , we can assign the accuracy number to each extraction function in the figure and take it as a quality measurement of the data extracted . We use kα to denote the accuracy of record detection , and kγ to denote the accuracy of attribute extraction of record k .
3 . An object can be described at two different levels . The first one is the record level representations , in which an object can be viewed as the collection of a set of extracted records and the attributes of each record are not further distinguished . The second on is the attribute level representations , in which an object is made up of a set of attributes and each attribute is a collection of attribute instances extracted from the records in multiple sources .
4 . The importance of the thj attribute jβ , indicates the importance level of the attribute in calculating relevance probability . The problem of using differing weights for different attributes has been well studied in existing structured document retrieval work [ 30][28 ] and can be directly used in our Web object retrieval scenario .

2.2 Web Object Retrieval Our goal in this paper is to explore effective models to retrieval Web objects described above . The retrieval models should be insensitive to data errors and can achieve stable performance for data with varying extraction accuracy .
In document level information retrieval , there is no concept of correctness . This is because there is no pre defined semantic meaning of a document , and all the words and sentences in the document will define the meaning of the document . However the meaning of real world objects is pre defined and the descriptions about the objects on the Web may be incorrect . Since the users usually want to see the correct information about the most relevant real world objects first , it is critical to be able to use the accuracy of the extracted object descriptions in calculating the relevance probabilities of their corresponding real world objects .
3 . LANGUAGE MODELS FOR WEB OBJECT RETRIEVAL In this section , we present a language model to estimate the relevance between an object and a query . We first provide background on language modeling for document retrieval . We then propose several language models for Web object retrieval , namely an unstructured object retrieval model , a structured object retrieval model , and a hybrid model with both structured and unstructured retrieval features .
3.1 Background on Language Modeling Language models interpret the relevance between a document and a query as the probability of generating the query from the document ’s model . That is ,

Where wi is the ith query term of Q , |Q| is denoted as the length of Q , and P(wi|D ) is the probability of generating term wi from the language model of D . is commonly used
Given word w and document D , maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) to estimate probability P(w|D ) . Smoothing , which adjusts term probabilities to overcome data sparseness , is critical to the performance of language models . Among various smoothing methods , the Dirichlet prior smoothing is frequently discussed . By maximum likelihood estimation and Dirichlet smoothing , the probability of generating term w by the language model of document D can be estimated as follows ,

In the above formula,λcan be treated as a parameter with its value in [ 0 , 1 ] . It is common to let λrely on document length |D| , as follows ,

3.2 Web Object Retrieval In the following subsections , we present language models for Web object retrieval . 321 Record level Representation Model One simple way of scoring a Web object against a query is to consider each record as the minimum retrieval unit . In this way , all the information within a record is considered as a bag of words without further differentiating the attribute values of the object , and we only need to know the accuracy of record extraction . The advantage of this model is that no attribute value extraction is needed , so we can avoid amplifying the attribute extraction error for some irregular records whose information cannot be accurately extracted . This model can also be called unstructured object retrieval model since it treats each record as an unstructured document .
Now we present a language model for record level Web object retrieval . If we consider all the information about an object as a big document consisting of K records , we can have a language model for each record and combine them , as [ 28 ] have been done . One approach to combining the language models for all the records of object o is as follows , owp

Where C is the collection of all the records , and λ is set according to Dirichlet prior smoothing .
In this model , we only need to know the record extraction accuracy which can be easily obtained through empirical kα are normalized accuracy evaluation . Note that the parameters numbers and
α =∑ k

The intuition behind this model is that we consider all the fields within a record equally important and give more weight to the correctly detected records . 322 Attribute level Representation Model For the object records with good extraction patterns , we do hope to use the structural information of the object to estimate relevance . It has been shown that if we can correctly segment a document into multiple weighted fields ( ie attributes ) , we can achieve more desirable precision [ 30][28 ] . In order to consider the weight difference of different fields and avoid amplifying the attribute extraction error too much , we need to consider attribute extraction accuracy . This model can also be called structured object retrieval model since it treats each record as a structured document .
We consider all the information about an object as a big document consisting of K records and each record has M fields ( ie attributes ) , and we use the formula below to estimate the

Here P(w|Ojk ) is the probability of generating w by the record k . P(w|Ojk ) can be computed by treating each Ojk as a document , thj j field of

Where jC is the collection of all the thj fields of all the objects in the object warehouse , and λ is set according to Dirichlet prior smoothing .
The intuition behind this formula is that we give different weight to individual fields and give more weight to the correctly detected and extracted records . 323 Model Balancing Record level and Attributelevel Representations As we discussed earlier , the unstructured object retrieval method has the advantage of handling records with irregular patterns at the expenses of ignoring the structure information , while attributelevel retrieval method can take the advantage of structure information at the risk of amplifying extraction error .
We argue that the best way of scoring Web objects is to use the accuracy of extracted object information as the parameter to find the balance between structured and unstructured ways of scoring the objects . We use the formula below to estimate the probability of generating term w by the language model of object o ,

The basic intuition behind this formula is that we give different weights to individual fields for correctly extracted records and give the same weight to all the fields for the incorrectly extracted records .
4 . A Case Study Below we will use Libra ( http://libramsracn ) , a working scientific Web search engine we have built to motivate the need for objectlevel Web search and its advantages and challenges over existing search engines .
As shown in Figure 3 , we extract information from different Web databases and pages to build structured databases of Web objects including researchers , scientific papers , conferences , and journals . The objects can be retrieved and ranked according to their relevance to the query . The relevance is calculated based on all the collected information about this object , which is stored with respect to each individual attribute . For example , research paper information is stored with respect to the following attributes : title , author , year , conference , abstract , and full text . In this way , we can also handle structured queries and give different weights to different attributes when calculating relevance scores . Compared
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Identifying Structure in Web Pages84 with Google Scholar and CiteSeer , both of which solely search paper information at the document level , this new engine can retrieve and rank other types of Web objects . This includes authors , conferences and journals with respect to a query . This greatly benefits junior researchers and students in locating important scientists , conferences , and journals in their research fields .

We focus on exploring suitable models for retrieving Web objects . We argue that simply applying traditional document level IR models on Web object retrieval will not be able to achieve satisfactory ranking results . In traditional IR models , document is taken as the retrieval unit and the content of a document is reliable . However the reliability assumption is no longer valid in the object retrieval context . Multiple copies of information about the same object usually exist , and such copies may be inconsistent because of diverse Web site qualities and the limited performance of current information extraction techniques . If we simply combine the noisy and inaccurate attribute information extracted from different sources , we may not be able to achieve satisfactory ranking results . For example , in Table 1 we show the title and author information about a paper from DBLP and CiteSeer . As can be seen , the information from DBLP is almost correct because it is manually input . However , the information from CiteSeer is noisy and inaccurate because it is automatically extracted .

5 . EVALUATION The goal of the evaluation is to show that the best way of scoring Web objects is balancing structured and unstructured retrieval method , when the object information is collected from multiple inconsistent data sources . Although there’re some developed test collections in IR fields , such as TREC , INEX etc , there is little work on retrieving information from multiple inconsistent sources , and we cannot find any publicly available collections ( datasets ) for evaluation . For this reason , we evaluate the work in the context of Libra .
5.1 Datasets Libra contains 1.4 million computer science papers extracted from Web databases , pages and file . Libra integrates papers information by their titles , authors and years from Web databases such as DBLP , ACM Digital Library , CiteSeer and SCI .
In addition to papers from Web databases , Libra also crawls papers which are in PDF format from the Web . After the files are crawled , we use some program to convert the PDF files into HTML files , and then extract the following attribute information : paper title , author , abstract , and references , by an extractor we developed . During the system development process , we developed three versions of the extractor , which we named PEv1 , PEv2 and PEv3 for short . Since the main purpose of our experiments is to study the effectiveness of our model in handling varying extraction errors , we choose these three extractors from three different stages of our development process with varying accuracy levels for both record detection and attribute extraction . We empirically evaluated the extraction accuracy for these extractors , and the PEv3 achieved the best score , the PEv2 was less acceptable while the lowest was PEv1 ( see Table 3 for their extraction accuracy numbers ) .
Although we save many attributes of the paper object , only title , author and abstract are used in our experiments . Because most data sources provide such info and they’re the key elements to determine the relevance of a paper given a query .
To measure the inconsistent problem , we use the vector space model ( VSM ) [ 1 ] to calculate the distances between data sources . Since DBLP does not provide abstracts of papers , we compute the title distances between all the data sources as well as the full document ( title , author and abstract ) distances between sources exclude DBLP . Each document is represented by a VSM model and compared with its corresponding document in other data source . Then we calculate the average distances between data sources . The pairwise results could be seen in Table 2 , from which , it ’s clear to see that the inconsistent problem is rather serious even for short text like title .
5.2 Query Set We select some queries from one year log of Libra according to the following criteria :
The frequent query has high priority to be selected .
All the queries about author name , conference/journal name , or year are removed . Because our model only returns the document contains all the query terms , and it ’s very likely that the retrieved document is relevant to the query if only such kind of query term existed in it . Then no significant differences could be observed between models .
The queries that are too specific are removed . For example , a query like ‘The PageRank Citation Ranking : Bringing
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Identifying Structure in Web Pages85 Order to the Web’ which is a title of paper will get only two documents that contains all the query terms .
The selected queries are examined by the researchers in our organization to make sure that they have unambiguous meaning .
At last , we get 79 queries as the query set belonging to several domains , like database , Web search and security etc .

5.3 Retrieval Models We implement two other simple retrieval models in addition to the three models we introduced in Section 3 , and observe their precisions in our experiments .
Bag of Words ( BW ) : In this model , we treat all term occurrences in a record equally and there is no difference between records either . This is actually the traditional document retrieval model that considers all the information about the same object as a bag of words . Indeed , this is a special case for the record level representation model that each the record is assigned the equal kα .
Unstructured Object Retrieval ( UOR ) : This is the recordlevel representation model described in Section 321 Comparing to the BW model , this model takes the accuracy of record detection into account . weight to each attribute (
Multiple Weighted Fields ( MWF ) : This method assigns a jβ ) and amends the P(w|Ojk ) by multiplying the weight of the corresponding attribute . However , it does consider the extraction error . We use the same kγ for all records in the attribute level kα and representation model for this model .
Structured Object Retrieval ( SOR ) : This model is the attribute level representation model described in Section 322
Balancing Structured and Unstructured Retrieval ( BSUR ) :
This model is described in Section 323
5.4 Parameter Setting Compared to the traditional unstructured document retrieval , in our model we set a weight of each attribute ( jβ ) . The weights of the attributes are tuned manually by considering the importance of kγ ) , we attributes . To determine the extraction accuracy ( sampled some data for each data source , then compute the accuracy for both record and attribute extraction results . Table 3 shows the results . kα and

Although ACM , DBLP and SCI are built manually and got high extraction accuracy , we can’t totally depend on them to ensure data coverage . For example , the ACM only provides about 300,000 papers and many important articles are not covered . In addition , to keep the up to date data , the search engine has to crawl PDFs from the Web and extract info in them . Therefore , we have to utilize information from every source . Because each source provides only a subset of the papers in Libra , no single data source can dominate the results .
5.5 Experimental Results For each query , we try the five models over all the infomation from 7 data sources ( DBLP , ACM Digital Library , CiteSeer , SCI , PEv1 , PEv2 and PEv3 ) . Then the top 30 results of every query are collected from each algorithm and labeled with relevance judgments . In order to ensure a fair labeling process , all the top papers from all the models are merged before they were sent to the labeler . In this way the labeler could not know the ranked position and the connection between the models and the ranking results . We ask labelers with different background to handle the queries they are familiar with . We observe the precision at 10 , precision at 30 , average precision ( MAP ) and the precision recall curve to measure the performance of all five models . The result clearly shows that the Balancing Structured and Unstructured Retrieval ( BSUR ) model is consistently better than other models .
In Figure 4 we show the precision at rank=10 of the results returned by the five retrieval models , in Figure 5 we show the precision at rank=30 of the results returned by the five retrieval models , and Figure 6 is the average precision ( MAP ) for all the five models . The Precision Recall curve is also plotted in Figure 7 . As we can see , the models that considered accuracy levels of the extractors have better precision , and the BSUR model is much better than the other models . This is especially true if we want to reduce the error for the top ranked results ( for example , at rank=10 ) .
In addition to the performance test , statistical tests are also used to determine the significance of differences [ 16][36 ] . We did the paired t test analysis on F1 score . After grouped models with insignificant performance , the p value shows that BSUR is significantly better than {UOR , MWF , SOR} which are significantly better than BW .

We believe that even though several low quality data sources were used , we can achieve good retrieval results by combining all evidence from all data sources . To verify this , each time we use one of our developed extractors ( PEv1 , PEv2 , and PEv3) ) , and the four Web databases ( ACM , Citeseer , DBLP , SCI ) to complete our experiments , the quality of PEv1 , PEv2 and PEv3 become better and better . The MAP results for the five models are shown in Figure 8 . Because the results of P@10 and P@30 are similar to the MAP results , we omitted them . The result clearly illustrates that the BSUR model is almost insensitive to noise from low quality data sources if we use the evidence from other data sources , and our BSUR model is rather robust . In addition , models that consider extraction accuracy levels are consistently better than comparative models . Finally , the gap between models that consider extraction accuracy and models that not consider extraction accuracy will increase when noise increases .
To better control the error rate of data , we also manually add noise into the dataset . Both of record and attribute level errors of a record are brought in by adding irrelevant words , discarding some words or exchanging words between attributes according to some desired error rate . In this experiment , we introduce noise into ACM and SCI dataset , because they provide full documents data with best quality . The accuracy of these sources are set based on the error rate . Figure 9 shows the MAP results of all the models with different error rates . Because there is much more noise , the improvement and robustness of the model considering data qualities are much more significant .
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Identifying Structure in Web Pages87 6 . RELATED WORK Two types of ranking are considered in Web search engines , static rank and dynamic rank . For object level vertical search , the static rank has been studied in [ 1 ] . In this paper , we focus on the calculation of dynamic object rank .
There has been much work on passage retrieval [ 4][18 ] in the traditional document retrieval area . In recent years , researchers began to segment Web pages into blocks [ 22][2][3 ] to promote retrieval precision in Web search . In passage retrieval or block retrieval works , researchers primarily care about the way of segmenting documents or Web pages , and usually use the highest relevance score of a passage or block as the score of whole document or page . There are also many studies on structured document retrieval [ 34][19 ] and utilizing multiple fields of Web pages for Web page retrieval [ 28][33][9][6 ] . These methods linearly combine the relevance score of each field to solve the problem of scoring structured documents with multiple weighted fields . In [ 30 ] , the authors show that the type of linear score combination methods is not as effective as the linear combination of term frequencies . In our work , we follow this way of handling the multiple attributes problem .
XML retrieval has attracted great interest in recent years because of document presentation in XML form providing opportunities to utilize the structure of documents . Many works have been done to handle query language [ 13 ] for XML , solve the wide variety of length among XML elements [ 17 ] , and to deal with the overlap problem – one tag may be contained by another tag [ 7 ] . Besides these issues , people have also developed test collections like INEX . But because there ’s no extraction process , all the retrieval units of a document are from the same XML , they do not handle data inconsistency issues .
However , our work focuses on object level retrieval , which is much closer to users’ requirements and considers the quality of each data source and the accuracy of the extracted object information during retrieval . This is a completely new perspective , and differs significantly from the structured document retrieval and passage/block retrieval work we discussed above .
We noticed that a need exists for document level Web page retrieval to handle the anchor text field of a page , which is extracted from multiple Web pages [ 8][10 ] . Researchers in this area often treat all of the anchor texts as a bag of words for retrieval . There is little work which considers the quality of extracted anchor text . Moreover , since anchor text is a single field independently extracted from multiple Web pages , there is no need for unstructured retrieval . Because ignoring the structure information will not help improving the quality of the anchor text , there is no need for balancing structured and unstructured retrieval models .
The work on distributed information retrieval [ 5][14][23][35 ] is related to our work in the sense that it combines information from multiple sources to answer user queries . However , other researchers focus on selecting the most relevant search engines for queries and rank query results instead of integrating object information .
Information quality is one of the most important aspects of Web information integration , and it is closely related to our work since we need to know the quality of the data sources . Many interesting techniques have been studied on estimating the quality of the Web sources and databases [ 25][24 ] .
7 . CONCLUSION There is lots of structured information about real world objects embedded in static Web pages or online Web databases . Our work focuses on object level retrieval , which is a completely new perspective , and differs significantly from the existing structured document retrieval and passage/block retrieval work . We propose several language models for Web object retrieval , namely an unstructured object retrieval model , a structured object retrieval model , and a hybrid model with both structured and unstructured retrieval features . We test these models on Libra Academic Search and compare their performances . We conclude that the hybrid model is the superior by taking into account the extraction errors at varying levels .
