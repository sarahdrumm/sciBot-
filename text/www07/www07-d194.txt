ABSTRACT PageRank is known to be an efficient metric for computing general document importance in the Web . While commonly used as a one size fits all measure , the ability to produce topically biased ranks has not yet been fully explored in detail . In particular , it was still unclear to what granularity of “ topic ” the computation of biased page ranks makes sense . In this paper we present the results of a thorough quantitative and qualitative analysis of biasing PageRank on Open Directory categories . We show that the MAP quality of Biased PageRank generally increases with the ODP level up to a certain point , thus sustaining the usage of more specialized categories to bias PageRank on , in order to improve topic specific search .

INTRODUCTION
Full text search is probably one of the most important facilities to access documents in the Web . Unlike controlled collections such as digital libraries , the web does not have a rich set of annotations . Consequently , when the user wants to focus her query to a specific subject , she has to reformulate it with additional terms describing her topic of interest . Yet this also implies that the set of possible results is restricted to those documents which contain the given query terms . If the user wants for example to find “ sales contact ” persons in the topic of “ Business concerning natural textile fabrics ” , she has to express all this information as terms . This query augmentation will clearly deprive her from finding most pages containing only the phrase “ sales contact ” and the name of some textile company .
Since most queries submitted to web search engines consist only of very few keywords , search results are susceptible to be implicitly biased towards generally popular web sites . This is due to enriching text retrieval methods like TFxIDF with link analysis algorithms as PageRank [ 4 ] . A promising approach to solve this dilemma of under and

In most cases these biasing sets have been selected as subcategories of given large scale taxonomies , such as the Open Directory ( ODP)1 .
Although there exist a few prior studies analyzing the properties of such topically biased PageRank [ 1 ] , many aspects remained unstudied . In this paper we complete the investigation . We perform a utility analysis for topically biased PageRank and clarify the relation between the parameters of an ODP category ( eg , depth , number of children and siblings , number of pages therein , etc . ) and the quality of the resulted biased rankings . We also investigate the correlation between the biased ranking and the generic , nonbiased one . Finally , we sketch some applications of biased PageRank which could benefit from our study . 2 . DEEPER INSIDE ODP
Setup . We empirically analyzed the quality of the ODPbiased PageRank vectors2 using both quantitative measures , ie , Kendall Tau similarity [ 3 ] , and qualitative ones , ie , Mean Average Precision ( MAP ) . Our testbed was a 9.3M document web graph focused on the ODP catalog , which we have recently gathered using the Heritrix3 crawler . About 100 biasing ( sub )categories were randomly chosen from four top level categories , namely Business , Computers , Recreation and Sports . This selection process was executed as follows : For each of the four top categories , three subcategories were randomly picked ; then , for one of them , we again randomly took three subcategories and so on , until no deeper levels were available . Almost all paths ended at level 6 ( with level 1 being one of the ODP root categories ) . Finally , we computed Biased PageRank vectors using the pages residing in each of these categories as biasing sets .
We also selected five queries per category randomly using Google AdWords4 , which suggests commonly used query terms to some specific keywords of interest . Whenever such a query resulted in less than one hundred results within our index , we replaced it by another one , randomly selected as well . Nevertheless , in most cases we obtained several thousands of results per query . Note that these queries are implicitly focused on each given ODP topic , and thus they should have resulted in rather similar outputs for Nonbiased and Biased PageRank .

WWW 2007 / Poster PaperTopic : Search1211 Finally , we performed searches using the generated queries and Biased PageRank for each associated category , as well as its parent and each of its child categories . We also performed unbiased searches ( with regular PageRank ) for each query . In all cases , the output results were sorted by multiplying the Lucene5 TFxIDF score with the specific ( Biased ) PageRank scores . For the quantitative analysis , the Top 30 matches from each result list were compared using Kendall Tau , whereas for the qualitative one , we employed Mean Average Precision for the Top 10 results . Three persons evaluated all search results , rating them with 1 if they were relevant both to the given query and category , and with 0 otherwise . The MAP scores for each ( query , category ) pair were averaged over all subjects to obtain a single value per pair . These were then further averaged over all queries , thus calculating a MAP for each category , as used in Figure 1 .
Results . In order to visualize the results we modeled the categories as a directed hierarchical graph . Figure 1 presents a fragment of that graph corresponding to the top category /Business ) , which is representative for the remaining graph as well . Nodes represent categories and edges between them denote parent–child or child–parent relationships . An edge ’s width depicts the ( averaged ) Kendall similarity between the two categories . The thicker it is , the more similar the linked categories are . A node ’s contour line width represents the ratio between MAP for Biased PageRank and MAP for Nonbiased PageRank ( marked as “ NoBias ” ) . Again , the thicker this line is , the higher is the precision for Biased PageRank when compared to NoBias6 .
We now summarize our results as follows : • There is no relationship between the Kendall similarity of Biased and Unbiased PageRank ( edge weights ) and the category level . Even though one would expect lower categories to produce results more similar to each other ( as their biasing sets become rather small ) , this phenomenon does not always occur . More , there are higher level categories whose Biased PageRank vectors are quite similar ( eg , Textiles / Textiles_And_Nonwovens ) , although their biasing sets are larger . • The size of the biasing set neither correlates with the Kendall similarity , nor with the PageRank quality ( in terms of MAP ) . Large biasing sets may result in both high and minimal improvements over non biased PageRank . We thus suspected that a higher correlation might be achieved when comparing the connectivity of the pages within each biasing set with MAP . However , if this connectivity is expressed in terms of total amount of out links , again no correlation occurs . • The MAP ratings generally increase until ODP level five , and then drop sharply . This shows that bottom level ODP categories tend to be less useful biasing sets as page amount and connectivity are rather low . • MAP is not correlated with the Kendall similarity . • Kendall similarity to Unbiased PageRank almost always tends to 0 . This is quite important , as it shows that biasing does have a significant impact on ranking . • Kendall similarities between parent and child categories are generally very low ( < 02 ) This indicates that it would be useful to employ more specialized ( deeper )

Thus , ODP sibling categories are well defined , being quite distinct from each other .
Practical Applications .
It is important to note that biasing PageRank using ODP is highly useful in many applications . To name but a few , it can be employed for ( 1 ) Personalized Web Search ( ie , bias on user ’s topics of interest ) , ( 2 ) Faceted Seach ( ie , promote the selected facet by biasing ) , ( 3 ) Automatic Extension of the ODP ( ie , derive new qualitative pages to add into each category ) , etc . 3 . CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK In this paper we analyzed the quality of Biased PageRank under different categories of the Open Directory taxonomy . We showed that the MAP quality of Biased PageRank generally increases with the ODP level , yet it also starts dropping sharply at some point , when the amount and connectivity of the pages contained within that category level are too low . Moreover , we showed that biasing on different siblings , or on children of a given category would in general result in quite different outputs , thus sustaining the usage of more specialized ( deeper ) categories to bias PageRank on in order to obtain a better search outcome .
As computing Biased PageRank for all ODP categories is still rather time consuming , we intend to devise algorithms based upon these findings to automatically select only those categories which yield search results very different from regular PageRank , while also significantly improving its quality .
