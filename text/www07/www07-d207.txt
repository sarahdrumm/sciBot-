ABSTRACT This paper makes an intensive investigation of the application of Bayesian network in sentence retrieval and introduces three Bayesian network based sentence retrieval models with or without consideration of term relationships . Term relationships in this paper are considered from two perspectives : relationships between pairs of terms and relationships between terms and term sets . Experiments have proven the efficiency of Bayesian network in the application of sentence retrieval . Particularly , retrieval result with consideration of the second kind of term relationship performs better in improving retrieval precision .

1 . BAYESIAN NETWORK BASED SENTENCE RETRIEVAL MODELS Sentence retrieval is to retrieve query relevant sentences in response to users’ queries . However , large amount of uncertainties involved the process of sentence retrieval restrain the significant improvements in retrieval performance . In the field of information retrieval , Bayesian network [ 3 ] has been accepted as one of the most promising methodologies to deal with information uncertainty . Taking into account the intrinsic uncertainty of sentence retrieval , the advantage of incorporating Bayesian network into sentence retrieval is obvious . Inspired by the idea above , a Bayesian network based sentence retrieval model ( BNSR ) is proposed . An example of the topology of BNSR retrieval model is shown in Figure 1 . The relevance probability of sentence Sk to the query Q is evaluated as :
Q|SP ( ) = iT k w ∑ ik kSPa ) ( ∈

Q|TP ( i

Pa(Sk ) is defined as all terms in TS connecting to Sk , ie , Pa(Sk ) = {Ti∈TS | Ti∈Sk} ; wik means the weight of term Ti in sentence Sk and is defined as : represents the w ik i in sentence Sk ; P(Ti | Q ) = 1 if Ti∈Q else frequency of term T

In BNSR model , terms are assumed to be independent with each other . This assumption , although convenient in implementing , is not a reality . Term relationships deserve to be considered in the application of Bayesian network based sentence retrieval . Hence , this paper further proposes two expanded sentence retrieval models , ie , BNSR_TR and BNSR_CR .

The main idea of BNSR_TR retrieval model is to utilize additional connections between different terms of query and sentence to facilitate the relevance identification of each sentence to query . An example topology of BNSR_TR model is shown in Figure 2 . Compared with the BNSR model , BNSR_TR model has an additional term layer DTS that is constructed by duplicating each term in the term layer TS . Connections between terms of TS and DTS describe the relationships between pairs of terms . Here , the relationships are captured through an information space model , ie , Hyperspace Analogue to Language ( HAL ) [ 2 ] . Given a term Ti in HAL , it can be represented by a n dimensional term vector , each item describes the relevance of a term Tj to the term Ti and is formally described as . Based on this kind of term relationship , terms in DTS that are most relevant to each term in TS can be identified . Connections are then constructed by using arcs going from terms in TS to their relevant terms in DTS . Parents of term DT Now , the relevance of sentence Sk to query Q can be evaluated through two steps : 1 ) compute the relevance probability of each term DTj in DTS with respect to the query Q . j in DTS , or Pa(DTj ) , are terms of TS connecting to it .

BNSR_TR incorporates term relationships into the inference process of retrieval , but ignores an important factor , the context , in which inappropriate applications of term relationships are therefore incurred . To solve this problem , another expanded retrieval model BNSR_CR is proposed . An example of the topology of BNSR_CR retrieval model is shown in Figure 3 . Compared with BNSR_TR , sentences in BNSR_CR are represented as a group of individual terms and terms sets . Term relationships are constructed between terms and term sets rather than between terms . Term set in this paper is defined as a frequent term set identified through frequency mining algorithm [ 1 ] . In general , the most advantage of this kind of relationship is that it reinforces the validities of those sentences identified relevant . In this paper , relevance between a term Ti and a term set TCj , or , is defined as the sum of association TCiRel values between T i and each term of TCj . Based on this evaluation , term sets that are most relevant to terms in TS can be identified . Given a term Ti in TS , connections are then set up between Ti and each TCj ∈ TCS , which either is relevant to Ti or equals to Ti .

2 . EXPERIMENTS Our experiments are implemented on Aquaint Collection by using the TREC topics , N1 N100 . Relevance of sentences that are retrieved is assessed by using the relevance assessments provided by TREC for the Novelty Task . We compare the proposed retrieval models with three traditional approaches adopted for sentence retrieval : TFIDF model ( TFIDF ) , OKAPI model ( OKAPI ) and KL divergence model with Dirichlet smoothing ( KLD ) . These three models are implemented by using the Lemur1 toolkit . The comparison result in Table 1 and Table 2 show that the proposed sentence retrieval models outperform traditional retrieval models significantly . MAP represents the noninterpolated average precision averaged over all queries . AvgR is defined as C/R , where C is the number of the correctly identified sentences and R is the total number of relevant sentences for a given query , averaged over all queries . Moreover , the proposed retrieval models with consideration of term relationships perform better than that with no consideration of term relationships ( BNSR ) . Experiment results of BNSR_TR and BNSR_CR also show in improving retrieval recall while BNSR_CR performs better than BNSR_TR in improving retrieval precision . that BNSR_TR performs better than BNSR_CR
