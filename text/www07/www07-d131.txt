ABSTRACT Available methodologies for developing Sematic Web applications do not fully exploit the whole potential deriving from interaction with ontological data sources . Here we introduce an extension of the WebML modeling framework to fulfill most of the design requirements emerging for the new area of Semantic Web . We generalize the development process to support Semantic Web applications and we introduce a set of new primitives for ontology importing and querying .

INTRODUCTION
Modern Web applications comprise distributed data integration , remote service interaction , and workflow management of activities , possibly spawned on different peers . In this scenario , if semantics of data and applications is known , integration becomes more feasible . To address this challenge many semantic description languages arose like RDF , OWL and WSML . All these languages allow to formally model knowledge by means of ontologies : the resulting formal models are the starting point to enable easy information exchange and integration between machines . These languages are suitable for reasoning and inferencing , ie , to deduct more informations from the model by applying logic expressions . This makes the modeling task easier since not all the knowledge has to be modeled . Unfortunately , although the theoretical bases and some technological solutions are already in place for Semantic Web support , the techniques and methodologies for Semantic Web application design are still rather rough .

We claim that conceptual modeling can increase dramatically both efficiency and effectiveness of the design and implementation of such applications . At this purpose , we present an extension of the WebML domain specific language for Web application design , to model and develop Semantic Web applications that adopt Semantic Web technologies to better integrate distributed and semantic data sources or to provide semantic annotations of the deployed applications .
2 . EXTENDING THE WEBML METHOD
We enriched every level of the WebML methodology proposed first in [ 2 ] by : ( i ) extending the development process to describe the tasks related to the design of ontologies and semantic aspects of the web applications/services ; ( ii ) extending the data model to support semantic data sources ( ie , ontologies ) ; ( iii ) extending the hypertext model for querying ontologies , with particular attention to advanced and inferencing queries ; ( iv ) supporting semantic annotations of the applications in the presentation model . In particular we extended the WebML basic primitives provided by the hypertext model ( eg , Index and Data units ) to support ontological data sources ( eg , RDF/OWL ontologies ) and we defined a new set of primitives specifically designed to exploit ontology features and reasoning over ontological data . This new units are aggregated primitives that , depending on the type of parameters , execute differently . These units ( SubClassOf , InstanceOf , HasProperty , HasPropertyValue , PropertyValue , SubPropertyOf ) aim at providing explicit support to advanced ontological queries . They allow to extract classes , instances , properties , values ; to check existence of specific concepts ; and to verify whether a relationship holds between two objects .

Figure 2 : UML class diagram of the internal software architecture of the newly implemented units . is passed to the HasPropertyValue unit that extracts a set of URIs of instances ( albums or artists ) that have value as value of the mm:soundsLike property . If no instance is found , the user is redirected to the Search page through the KO link . Otherwise , the set of URIs is passed to the InstanceOf unit that checks if they are instances of the class Artist . In this case , the URIs are passed through the OK link to an Index unit showing list of Artists , otherwise the URIs are passed on the KO to publish a list of Albums ( not shown in the figure ) .
Moreover , each WebML semantic unit can automatically extract a RDF description of its contents . The designer has to specify how he wants to use the RDF fragments ; for instance , he can aggregate the fragments of all the units in the page and publish the aggregate at the bottom of the page , as a global semantic annotation of the page itself ; or he can maintain them separated and publish the RDF annotation for each unit in the page .
Besides the units for ontological data query , we introduce also three new units : the Set Composition unit performs set operations ( ie , union , intersection , difference ) over two input sets of URIs , considering the hierarchy of the URIs involved ; the Import Ontological Source unit adds a remote or local data source that must be consistent with ontological model of the web application ( it ’s validated against it before being added to the ontology ) ; the Describe unit returns the RDF description of a URI , thus enabling data exporting and semantic annotation of pages . The above mentioned querying units can be used to compose reasoning tasks over ontological data . Eg , suppose that we want to discover the common super concepts between two ontology classes ; we can use two SubClassOf units to extract the two set of super classes to which the two classes belongs to ; then we can find the common set of superclasses by means of the SetComposition unit . For instance , if we apply the previous pattern to two music genre classes like Progressive Rock and Urban Hip Hop , we get their common superclasses ( eg , the Rock class ) .
3 . ARCHITECTURE
We extended the WebRatio CASE tool [ 5 ] and its runtime libraries to support the new units . The prototype implementation is based on Jena framework [ 3 ] to interact with OWL/RDF ontologies . The design environment offered by Webratio has been extended exploiting the plug in mechanism of the toolsuite : we devised a general purpose data access layer to ontological data sources , plus a runtime Java component and an XML descriptor for each unit .
To handle interaction with ontologies we defined a new data access layer , comprising a set of general purpose Java classes to be reused by all the new units for querying the ontology repositories . These classes provide facilities to import ontologies and to select OWL/RDF classes , properties , and instances ( possibly filtered by one or more conditions ) . The main aspects of the class structure are represented in Figure 2 .
The OntologyModelService enables connections to local and remote ontologies specified at design time or imported at runtime by mean of the Import Ontological Source unit . Three abstract classes offer the query services corresponding to the query methods offered by SPARQL on the ontology contents : the AbstractSelectQueryService class performs selection over data ; the AbstractDescribeQueryService retrieves the RDF describing a given URI , the AbstractAskQueryService verifies simple predicates . The AbstractAskQueryService is extended by the AskQueryService that is used by some of the advanced querying units to verify predicates ( eg , to check whether a class is subclass of another ) . The new ontological primitives use or implement these services for performing their task .
4 . CONCLUSION
We presented an extension to the WebML methodology and models for supporting the design and the specification of Semantic Web applications . In [ 1 ] we presented our vision on the needs and the opportunity of applying Web Engineering methods to the development of Semantic Web Services in the context of the WSMO framework . In particular we showed how , starting from a rich and annotated model of a Web Service , it is possible to automatically generate both the implementation of the Web Service and a large part of its semantic description . Here we described a solution that provides a full coverage of the development process , and allows the designer to specify at a high level of abstraction basic and advanced queries on ontological data sources , to import existing sources , and to annotate Web pages with semantic descriptions of the contents and of the models . We support our proposal with a prototype implementation within the CASE tool WebRatio .
