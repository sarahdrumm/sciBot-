ABSTRACT Hierarchical models are commonly used to organize a Website ’s content . A Website ’s content structure can be represented by a topic hierarchy , a directed tree rooted at a Website ’s homepage in which the vertices and edges correspond to Web pages and hyperlinks . In this work , we propose a new method for constructing the topic hierarchy of a Website . We model the Website ’s link structure using weighted directed graph , in which the edge weights are computed using a classifier that predicts if an edge connects a pair of nodes representing a topic and a subtopic . We then pose the problem of building the topic hierarchy as finding the shortest path tree and directed minimum spanning tree in the weighted graph . We’ve done extensive experiments using real Websites and obtained very promising results .

INTRODUCTION Users looking for information on the web frequently need to explore particular websites carefully to locate individual pages with interesting information . Many websites provide sitemaps to facilitate navigation . Sitemaps usually list the major topics of a website . By taking a look at the site map , one may quickly settle on one or more topics that are of interest . Despite the usefulness of sitemaps , websites with sitemaps only account for a small portion of the entire web since sitemaps are usually manually constructed . Besides , such manual process is very time consuming . Individual websites are more organized compared with the entire web . Hierarchical model is most commonly used for the organization of complex bodies of information on websites because of its simplicity and clarity . Using this model , a large website is first divided into a number of broad topics , which are recursively divided into subtopics . We define such hierarchical content structure of a website as its topic hierarchy . More formally , a topic hierarchy is a directed tree which is rooted at the homepage of the website and provides a path formed by hyperlinks from the root to every page in the website . In this paper , we study the problem of constructing a website ’s topic hierarchy , in particular , how to extract it from the link structure of the website , which is a general directed graph .

2 . TOPIC HIERARCHY MINING 2.1 Overview : Our approach for generating a Website ’s topic hierarchy is based on analyzing its link structure , which is a general directed graph as shown in Figure 1 . We define two types of hyperlinks based on the different functions they serve . When designing a Website , there are always hyperlinks pointing from a topic to its subtopics , as these are the essential links for browsing a Website . We refer to the hyperlinks connecting a topic to its subtopics as aggregation links , which are represented by the solid arrows in Figure 1 . In the mean time , there exist a large number of hyperlinks that are not used to connect topics to subtopics , but are created simply to facilitate navigation between pages , which we refer to as short cut links . These are indicated by the dashed arrows in Figure 1 . A key challenge in extracting the topic hierarchy from the link structure is therefore to distinguish aggregation links from short cut links . There exists several graph algorithms that have be adapted to extract a tree structure from a directed graph including breadthfirst search , shortest path search and directed minimum spanning tree [ 3 ] . Breadth first search deals with unweighted graph and minimizes the number of edges between root and other pages . Shortest path search and directed minimum spanning tree work on weighted directed graph and minimizes the total weight of all tree paths and the total weight of all edges respectively . 2.2 Edge Weight Function Both the shortest path search and the directed minimum spanning tree algorithm work on weighted directed graph . The edge weight function therefore plays an important role in the selection of edges during topic hierarchy construction . Clearly , the edges in a topic hierarchy should be aggregation links . It should be noted that both shortest path search and directed minimum spanning tree favor edges with smaller weight . Therefore , the edge weight function should be designed in such
WWW 2007 / Poster PaperTopic : Search1127 a way that aggregation links are assigned smaller weights than short cut links . Our idea is to treat the edge weighting problem as a standard classification problem , in which we attempt to classify a hyperlink into one of two types : aggregation vs . shortcut . Based on the content , layout and link information , we derived the following set of features for a hyperlink pointing from u to v : • Path Relation : through examining the path information in each webpage ’s URL , we may identify if u is in the same , the parent , the child or the sibling folder as v .
• Explicit Entry Page : whether the file name of u is index.html
• Content Similarity : the textual similarity between u and v tfidf vector the cosine between measured by representation of the two web pages . the
• Within Navigation Bar : whether the link is within a navigation bar , which is identified as a node in the DOM tree containing a set of links . Position in Text : whether a link is at the beginning , middle or end of a paragraph .
•
• Anchor Text Length : number of words in the anchor text • Anchor Text Font Size : font size of the anchor text Based on these features , we could build hyperlink classifiers using a set of labeled links . In this work , we used three types of classifiers : naïve Bayes , decision tree and logistic regression . Instead of using the classifiers to produce a binary output indicating the type of the hyperlink , we adapt the classifiers to produce a real value output between 0 and 1 indicating the confidence that the link is an aggregation link . The resulted weighted graph would therefore be more fine grained than one with edge weights are either 0 or 1 . 3 . EXPERIMENTS We tested the algorithm using 5 different web sites . A human judge was asked to manually construct a topic hierarchy for each test website for use as benchmark . Given the benchmark , we evaluate the accuracy of a generated topic hierarchy based on the proportion of web pages which are connected to the same parent as in the benchmark . For each page in the benchmark , the link to it included in the topic hierarchy is an aggregation link while the other incoming links to it represent short cut link . Table 1 shows some statistics about the benchmark data .

The breadth first search ( BFS ) algorithm is the simplest approach and represents the baseline in our experiments . Table 1 shows the performance of BFS . For the shortest path search ( SPS ) and directed minimum spanning tree ( DMST ) algorithms , we first build the hyperlink classifiers following the leave onesite out procedure : to classify the hyperlinks in one Website , we train the classifier using the hyperlinks from the other 4 Websites . This allows us to test if a general link classification model could be obtained to apply to unseen Websites . We build different versions of weighted directed graphs using each of the three types of classifiers and compare the performances of the algorithms on the different graphs Table 3 and 4 . As can be seen from the results , the SPS and DMST algorithms using weighted graph models outperform the simple BFS significantly . The result also shows decision tree as the most effective classifier for generating the edge weight . For 4 of 5 websites , the DMST algorithm with decision tree for edge weighting achieved the optimal performance .
