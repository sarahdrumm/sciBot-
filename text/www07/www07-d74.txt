ABSTRACT It is now feasible to view media at home as easily as text based pages were viewed when the World Wide Web ( WWW ) first emerged . This development has supported media sharing and search services providing hosting , indexing and access to large , online media repositories . Many of these sharing services also have a social aspect to them . This paper provides an initial analysis of the social interactions on a video sharing and search service ( wwwyoutubecom ) Results show that many users do not form social networks in the online community and a very small number do not appear to contribute to the wider community . However , it does seem those people who do use the available tools have much a greater tendency to form social connections .

1 . INTRODUCTION Websites that allow users to share media online have become a phenomenon of growing social , economic and cultural importance , routinely attracting millions of users and hits . Prime examples of this phenomenon can be found in Flickr ’s support for the sharing of photographs and YouTube ’s sharing of video files . Apart from sharing , some other websites explicitly support social networking ( eg , MySpace and Bebo ) allowing media sharing and the sharing of tastes and interests . In this paper , we examine social interaction between users on YouTube . This social interaction is examined by looking at the tools people use to share online media and index video clips ( see Ducheneaut et al [ 2 ] for a related study in online gaming ) . Our focus is to determine whether aspects of this behavior that can be used to improve collaborative based search on future systems ( eg , [ 4] ) . Such an approach could significantly enhance the metadata attached by creators of the media , thus enhancing the searching of such repositories . 2 . ANALYSING USERS USING SOCIAL FEATURES In June 2006 , we carried out a crawl of the YouTube video sharing and search engine . Over 100,000 pages were downloaded involving videos added by 57,588 YouTube users ; coming from 204 countries with a mean age of 25 . In September 2006 , the online behavior of these users was analyzed focusing on their use

About half of these users were male , a quarter being female and the remainder not indicating their sex .

Table 1 : Analysis of Users of the YouTube Service
Table 1 illustrates some of the key figures from the analyses of interaction carried out . They suggest the following : • Users tend to visit the site to view videos rather than to add their own media ; on average they view 966 videos though they only upload 11 videos on the site ( though note that the variance is huge compare the Max with the Min/Equal toZero ) .
•
• Users are more likely to save videos to their profiles rather than upload videos , each user saved an average of approximately 15 videos to their profile There is a widespread failure amongst users to exploit the community facilities available on the website ( ie , most users are not members of groups , do not have any subscriptions , do not list friends or favorite videos , and have not posted any comments on videos ) .
These findings have several implications for any attempt to leverage this data for personalization or recommendation purposes . Specifically , these usage patterns suggest that usage data might not be that useful for generating predictions for communities of users . However , the fact that some of these averages are reasonably high indicates that the users who use these facilities use them quite often , and that the minority of users who use these facilities might benefit from such facilities . In fact since an initial ( and less detailed ) crawl of these users profiles was carried out by us the average number of uploads has
WWW 2007 / Poster PaperTopic : Social Networks1273 increased by approximately 9 , the average number of friends increased by approximately 3 and the average number of views increased by 500 . Of those 3 categories the only one to show a large decrease in the number equal to zero is the number of uploads . This indicates that the small number of users who use these facilities continue to do so at a regular rate . that users in this scenario actually visit more pages within the site , or within a session than in the desktop or mobile browsing paradigm . However , when the distribution of uploads and the number of favourites was investigated a Zipf like distribution was indeed found .

Figure 1 : Average number of social features with respect to number of uploaded videos on YouTube website .
Figure 1 shows the figures for different social interactions with respect to the number of files that users upload , for all users . Figure 1 shows that users who are forming social groups , favour being friends as a facility to form these groups , rather than explicitly being member of a group . It also shows that users have more subscriptions on average than any other social interaction . As expected the number of subscribers that a user has increases with the number of videos that a user has uploaded . When the same graph is plotted with respect to the number of views for all users , the number of subscribers increases with respect to views and then falls off after a certain point ( figure not shown due to space requirements ) . The shape of the graphs for friends , groups and subscriptions are similar with respect to both views and uploads . In both scenarios it can be seen that the number of friends increases to a point and then begins to tail off slowly . Again in both scenarios the number of subscriptions that a user has and the number of groups that they are a member of are negligible . 3 . DISTRIBUTION OF VIEWS In this section , the distribution of views for users of the website are investigated . Figure 2 shows the distribution of views of videos files for the users of YouTube . The distribution of uploads and the distribution of favorites was also investigated , but for reasons of space is not shown here . We found that the distribution of views does not reflect the Zipf type distributions typically observed in desktop and mobile browsing contexts [ 3 ] . Instead a slight curvature in the distribution can be seen . This distribution is similar to one found in search logs [ 1 ] and indicates that users find videos through searching rather than browsing . In web scenarios , the Zipf distribution is typically a consequence of the fact that there are very few pages with large numbers of hits , and many pages have very few hits . However , in this case , users with high numbers of “ views ” increase to a certain point and then drop off in a more Zipf like way . This distribution suggests

4 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK For this analysis a database of information about users that use a video sharing and search system , YouTube , was created . This database also contained information about the users that have added those video files to the search engine . It has been shown that in general , a large number of users do not use the facilities for social interaction available to them in media sharing services . However , those users that do appear to use those services quite frequently , creating social networks within those media sharing services . Hopefully such social networks can be exploited in order to aid the user experience within these services , eg media search within the service . With the growth of media online and as it becomes more accessible to users it is important that better search methods are discovered , and differences between search paradigms and users are identified . To that end , this work will lead the way and help improve video search . This information can help make content more accessible to users of the Internet . 5 .
