ABSTRACT It is widely believed that some queries submitted to search engines are by nature ambiguous ( eg , java , apple ) . However , few studies have investigated the questions of “ how many queries are ambiguous ? ” and “ how can we automatically identify an ambiguous query ? ” This paper deals with these issues . First , we construct the taxonomy of query ambiguity , and ask human annotators to manually classify queries based upon it . From manually labeled results , we find that query ambiguity is to some extent predictable . We then use a supervised learning approach to automatically classify queries as being ambiguous or not . Experimental results show that we can correctly identify 87 % of labeled queries . Finally , we estimate that about 16 % of queries in a real search log are ambiguous .

1 . INTRODUCTION Some technologies like personalized Web search and search results clustering aim to improve users’ satisfaction towards ambiguous queries from different perspectives . However , there is no sufficient study on ambiguous queries identification . Questions like “ what percentage of queries are ambiguous ? ” and “ can we automatically determine whether a query is ambiguous ? ” are still open . If we can estimate the percentage of ambiguous queries , we would know how many queries will be influenced potentially by the query ambiguity oriented technologies . If we can further identify ambiguous queries automatically , it is possible to apply such technologies for a particular kind of queries , instead of for all . We will try to answer such questions in this paper . Identifying ambiguous queries is challenging for three reasons . First , there is no acknowledged definition and taxonomy of query ambiguity . Many this concept , such as terms related to

“ ambiguous query , ” “ semi ambiguous query , ” “ clear query , ” “ general term , ” “ broad topic , ” and “ diffuse topic . ” These terms are confusing in our investigation . Second , it is uncertain whether most queries can be associated with a particular type in terms of ambiguity quality . Cronen Townsend et al . [ 1 ] proposed to use the relative entropy between a query and the collection to quantify query clarity , but the score is not easily aligned to concepts in human ’s mind . Third , even if ambiguous queries can be recognized manually , it is not realistic to label thousand of queries sampled from query logs . So how can we identify them in an automatic way ? In this paper , we first construct taxonomy for query ambiguity from the literature . We then assess human agreement on query classification through a user study . Based on the findings , we take a supervised identify ambiguous queries . Experimental results show that our approach achieves 85 % precision and 81 % recall in identifying ambiguous queries . Finally , we estimate that about 16 % of queries in the sampled search log are ambiguous . 2 . TAXONOMY OF QUERIES By surveying the literature , we summarize the following three types of queries from being ambiguous to specific . learning approach to automatically
Type A ( Ambiguous Query ) : a query that has more than one meaning ; eg “ giant , ” which may refer to “ Giant Company Software Inc . ” ( an internet security software developer ) , “ Giant ” ( a film produced in 1956 ) , “ Giant Bike ” ( a bicycle manufacturer ) , or “ San Francisco Giants ” ( National League baseball team ) .
Type B ( Broad Query ) : a query that covers a variety of subtopics and a user might look for one of the subtopics by issuing another query . eg “ songs , ” which covers some subtopics such as “ song lyrics , ” “ love songs , ” “ party songs , ” and “ download songs . ” In practice , a user often issues such a query first , and then narrows down to a subtopic .
Type C ( Clear Query ) : a query that has a specific meaning and covers a narrow topic . eg “ University of Chicago ” and “ Billie Holiday . ” A clear query usually means a successful search in which a user can find several results with a high degree of quality in the first results page . 3 . USER STUDY The purpose of user study is to answer whether it is ever possible to associate a query with a certain type by looking at Web search results . Since it is difficult to find different meanings of a query by going through all the results , we use clustered search results generated by Vivisimo [ 5 ] to facilitate understanding the query .

Figure 1 . Projection of documents represented in categories for three example queries
Queries used in our user study are sampled from 12 day Live Search [ 4 ] query logs in August 2006 . We use a total of 60 queries and involve five human subjects . Each participant is asked to judge whether a query is ambiguous ( Type A ) or not . If the query is not ambiguous , the participant would answer an additional question : “ Is it necessary to add some words to the query in order to let it be clearer ? ” The question aims to clarify whether the query is broad ( Type B ) or clear ( Type C ) . The user study results indicate that participants are in general agreement , ie 90 % , in judging whether a query is ambiguous or not . However , it is difficult to distinguish Type B from Type C as the agreement is only 50 % . 4 . LEARNING A QUERY AMBIGUITY MODEL In this paper , we utilize a query q and a set of top n search results D with respect to the query in modeling query ambiguity . We formulate the problem of identifying ambiguous queries as a classification problem : f q D ( ,

Based on the findings in the user study , we aim to classify a query as A ( ambiguous queries ) or A ( broad or clear queries ) . Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) developed by Vapnik [ 3 ] with RBF kernel is used as our classifier . A text classifier similar to that used in [ 2 ] is applied to classify each Web document in KDDCUP 2005 . We represent a document by a vector of categories , the confidence that the document belongs to a category . Our main idea of identifying an ambiguous query is that relevant documents with different interpretations probably belong to several different categories . To illustrate this assumption , we project documents into a three dimensional ( 3D ) space and show three example queries in Figure 1 . The coordinates correspond to three categories that a query most likely belongs to . “ Giant ” , as an ambiguous query , may refer to “ giant squid ” in Library category , “ Giant Company Inc . ” in Computing category , and “ Gaint Food supermarket ” in Work&Money category . Figure 1(a ) shows scattered distribution among these three categories . “ Billie Holiday ” is a clear query and Figure 1(c ) shows almost all the documents are gathered in the category of Entertainment . “ Songs ” is a broad query . A pattern of documents between being scattered and gathered is observed in Figure 1(b ) .
12 features are derived to quantify the distribution of D , such as the maximum Euclidean distance between a document vector and the centroid document vector in D . 5 . EXPERIMENTS We conduct the experiments of learning a query ambiguity model on 253 labeled queries . Five fold cross validation is performed . The best classifier in our experiments achieves precision of 85.4 % , recall of 80.9 % , and accuracy of 874 % Such performance verifies that ambiguous queries can be identified automatically . We try to estimate what percentage of queries is ambiguous in a query set sampled from Live Search logs . The set consists of 989 queries . To achieve the goal , our newly learned query ambiguity model is used to do prediction on the query set . When we increase the size of query set for estimation from 1/10 to 10/10 , the percentage first vibrates between 15 % and 18 % and finally stabilizes at around 16 % . Therefore , we estimate that about 16 % of all the queries are ambiguous . 6 . CONCLUSION In this paper , we find people are in general agreement on whether a query is ambiguous or not . Thus we propose a machine learning model based on search results to identify ambiguous queries . The best classifier achieves high accuracy as 87 % . By applying the classifier , we estimate that about 16 % queries are ambiguous in the sampled logs . 7 . REFERENCES [ 1 ] S . Cronen Townsend , Y . Zhou , and W . B . Croft .
