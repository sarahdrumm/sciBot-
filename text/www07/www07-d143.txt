ABSTRACT
Information flows in a network where individuals influence each other . The diffusion rate captures how efficiently the information can diffuse among the users in the network . We propose an information flow model that leverages diffusion rates for : ( 1 ) prediction – identify where information should flow to , and ( 2 ) ranking – identify who will most quickly receive the information . For prediction , we measure how likely information will propagate from a specific sender to a specific receiver during a certain time period . Accordingly a rate based recommendation algorithm is proposed that predicts who will most likely receive the information during a limited time period . For ranking , we estimate the expected time for information diffusion to reach a specific user in a network . Subsequently , a DiffusionRank algorithm is proposed that ranks users based on how quickly information will flow to them . Experiments on two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms the recommendation performance and rank users by the efficiency of information flow .

1 . INTRODUCTION
People constantly influence each other in all facets of life . Social influence describes the phenomenon by which the behavior of an individual is directly or indirectly affected by the thoughts , feelings , and actions of others in a population [ 1][21 ] . Such influence is present when people recommend products or services to one another . Word of mouth communication is a particular type of informational social influence , and plays an important role in shaping the attitudes and behaviors of consumers .
When one needs to choose among various options where he/she has no experience , one will often rely on the opinions of others with such experiences . However , when there are thousands or millions of options , like on the Web , it becomes practically impossible for an individual to identify reliable experts that can Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee ( IW3C2 ) . Distribution of these papers is limited to classroom use , and personal use by others . WWW 2007 , May 8–12 , 2007 , Banff , Alberta , Canada . ACM 978 1 59593 654 7/07/0005 . an individual of
It based infers on like minded users’ opinions . give advice about each of the options . Collaborative Filtering was proposed to automate the process of "word of mouth" [ 2 ] by the leveraging interests/preferences the interests/preferences of people with similar tastes [ 3][4 ] . In Collaborative Filtering , similarity which is a symmetric relationship between users plays a central role . However , it is in fact the inter personal influence an asymmetric relationship that most directly and effectively supports the automation of the word of mouth process . For instance , asymmetric relationships such as employer to employee , teacher to student , and physicianto patient have a much stronger influence on decisions than their reverse relationships . We recently proposed a novel asymmetric recommendation algorithm based on such asymmetric interpersonal relationships [ 5 ] . The algorithm leverages a user ’s explicit or implicit influence over other users , instead of the mere symmetric similarity of users’ interests in Collaborative Filtering . People adopt new technologies at different times . The idea of modeling the adoption behaviors of a group of people as a flow process comes from Rogers’ “ Diffusion of Innovation ” theory [ 6 ] , in which the adoption curve classifies adopters of innovations into five categories based on the fact that certain individuals are inevitably more open to adoption than others in a population . The innovation can be an idea , a practice , or an object . The five adopter categories , ( 1 ) innovators , ( 2 ) early adopters , ( 3 ) early majority , ( 4 ) late majority , and ( 5 ) laggards , follow a standard deviation curve . Innovators and early adopters are usually the social leaders . Early majority , late majority , and laggards are the followers . The perceived novelty of the idea by an individual determines his/her reaction to it . As a result , diffusion is the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a population . The information can be imagined flowing from social leaders to followers . The behavior of followers is directly or indirectly influenced by the actions of social leaders . In this paper , we use terms “ influence ” , “ information flow ” , and “ information diffusion ” interchangeably to represent the same concept .
Figure 1 ( a ) provides an intuitive example of the diffusion of innovation theory on the adoption of VCRs in the 1980s [ 7 ] . As illustrated in Figure 1(a ) , when VCRs enter the market , only around one million users adopt them . From 1980 to 1986 , the number of adoptions keeps increasing , and finally declines after 1986 . Similar diffusion patterns exist on other products and technologies . We may remember how the cell phones are adopted in our family , as shown in Figure 1(b ) . One month after the cool neighbor ( u1 ) purchases a cell phone , the kid ( u2 ) notices it and persuades the family to get him one to contact the friends at school . Then the father(u3 ) also finds that he needs it for work and decides to get another one , following is the mother ( u4 ) . Finally , it takes a long time for the grandmother ( u5 ) to accept the cell phone technology and purchase one .
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Mining in Social Networks191 Diffusion has a time dimension , which Rogers describes as the "innovation decision" process [ 6 ] . The influence of central users tends to spread more rapidly throughout a network than the influence of peripheral users does . Also , it usually takes less time to reach central users than peripheral users when information flows in the network . Information flows in different rates through the network . Our previous model [ 5 ] ignores the fact that the network is not homogeneous in terms of the diffusion rate .
Let us continue the previous example with users u1 to u5 , representing the neighbor , the kid , the father , the mother , and the grandmother respectively as illustrated in Figure 1(b ) . Although the father , the mother , and the grandmother will follow whatever the kid adopts ( ie , the kid influences the father , the mother , and the grandmother in the same amount ) , the father always follows the kid within one day , while it will take more than a year for the grandmother to follow up . Information flows from the kid to the father much faster than to the grandmother . Given the kid adopts one item at time t , it is more likely that the father will adopt it at time t+1 than the grandmother , although the grandmother may eventually be interested in the item and adopt it at a much later stage . Therefore , it attains higher successful rate to recommend the item to the father than to the grandmother at time t+1 .
On the other hand , let us look at the problem of ranking these five users to find out the most efficient receiver of information . As what we have analyzed , the father should be the most efficient receiver in the network . However , by using existing ranking algorithms such as PageRank [ 9 ] or HITS [ 10 ] , which do not take the diffusion rate into account , we can not find the correct answer , and instead , the grandmother is ranked as the most important receiver in the network .

In this section , we review the diffusion of innovation theory , the related work on recommendation algorithms , and the Markov chain based website ranking algorithms . 2.1 Diffusion of Innovation Theory
In [ 6 ] , Everett Rogers describes the different stages of product adoption and indicates that the spread of a new technology depends mainly on two factors ; innovation or imitation . Innovators are driven by their desire to try innovations ; in contrast , imitators are primarily influenced by the behaviors of their peers . The Bass model [ 15 ] quantifies the concept of the introduction of products/technologies by introduction ( innovation ) and acceptance rate variables . The model is widely used in market analysis and demand forecasting of innovation diffusion in various areas . estimating ( imitation )

In this paper , we propose an information flow model with inter personal diffusion rate taken into account to measure how efficiently information diffuses from one user to another in the information flow network . The algorithm is based on ContinuousTime Markov Chain , in which we model both the probability ( how likely ) and the rate ( how fast ) for the information to flow from
( )N t is the cumulative number of adopters by time t ; the where parameter m is the market potential , indicating the total number of people who will eventually adopt the item ; the coefficient p is called the coefficient of innovation , indicating the external influence or advertising effect ; the coefficient q is called the coefficient of imitation , indicating internal influence or word ofmouth effect .
However , the Bass model ignores the network structure , which could significantly influence the diffusion process , and only takes the global diffusion rate into consideration .
Identifying how information is propagated in a network is important in various applications . Network based marketing refers to a collection of marketing techniques that take advantage of links between consumers to increase sales [ 16 ] . [ 17 19 ] attempt to model influence among consumers and understand how this influence propagates in the networks . The problem they address is : suppose that we have data on a potential network of consumers with estimation of the extent to which individuals influence one
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Mining in Social Networks192 another , if we are given a new product and a marketing budget , how can we maximize the adoption of the new product through customers ? The threshold model and the cascade model have been considered in [ 19 ] . Information propagation through blogosphere is also recently studied [ 20 ] . These models ignore the interpersonal diffusion the information propagates in the network . 2.2 Recommendation Algorithms rate , which describes how
Various Collaborative Filtering algorithms have been designed to identify users of similar interests [ 3 ] . The similarity metrics include cosine distance , correlation , and mean squared difference . [ 8 ] utilizes the average commute time in a network to calculate the distance of a pair of users . rapidly
However , as we demonstrate in [ 5 ] , symmetric similarity is not as direct and effective as asymmetric inter personal influence between people for recommendation . We observe people intentionally or unintentionally influence and inspire each other , thus creating an interest in retrieving or getting a specific kind of information or product . Therefore , we model the information adoption behaviors of a group of people as an information flow process . This process captures the amount and direction in which information is propagated in a network to predict where the information may flow to . Effective recommendations are generated as the result .
However , our previous information flow model ignores the diffusion rate , which describes how efficiently information flows from one user to another in the network . 2.3 Ranking Algorithms
Markov Chain based models have been proven successful in ranking web pages ( [9 11] ) . The PageRank algorithm [ 9][10 ] computes the “ importance ” of web pages through a stochastic ergodic Markov transition matrix , which is constructed from all hyperlinks between web pages . The HITS algorithm [ 11 ] forms both an authority matrix and a hub matrix from the hyperlink adjacency matrix , rather than one Markov chain . As a result , HITS returns both authority and hub scores for each web page .
The research discussed above has focused on using static properties , such as the connectivity of the nodes in a network and the average node distances , to represent the complex structure . However , networks evolve over time . Dynamic factors in the context of the web are essential and could not be ignored . Based on the fact that users are not only interested in the pages with high authority scores , but also the recent information , [ 12 ] proposes TRank to take into account the temporal aspects such as freshness and update activity of pages and links when computing the importance of a page . [ 13 ] proposes a Markov centrality based on the mean first passage time to measure the relative importance in networks . IRank [ 14 ] utilizes the timing ordering of the blogs to infer implicit links between blogs and rank the blogs according to those implicit links .
However , to the best of our knowledge , the diffusion rate , which shows how long it takes for a node in the network , such as a webpage or a user , to be aware of other nodes and make an explicit or implicit link , is ignored in previous research . 3 . PROBLEM FORMULATION
The central problem we address in this paper is the efficiency of information flow . On the inter personal level , we measure how likely information goes from a specific sender to a specific receiver during a limited time period . On the individual level , we estimate the expected rate that information diffuses to a particular

(
Assume we have a network node starting from an arbitrary node in the network . Thus , prediction of users’ preferences of information , and ranking users by the efficiency of information flow can be formulated as follows . G n w τ containing a set of nodes n with a size of N , where edges between nodes represent the information flow paths , w denotes the weights on the edges to represent the amount of information flow from one node to another , and τ denotes the time delay on information flow paths . 3.1 Recommendation
0t and { , }u z
For the problem of prediction of users’ preferences of information , the question we address is how likely for information to go from a specific sender to a specific receiver within a certain n⊂ , where u represents time period . Given time those who have adopted the item , and z represents those who have not , we calculate the likelihood that users z will follow users u to adopt the item before time t . We denote this likelihood as 3.2 Ranking
( L z u t ,
For ranking problem , the question we address is what the expected time is for a user to receive information in a network . We calculate on average , how efficient for the information flowing from other users to a particular user i , and rank users ( )R i based on the diffusion “ efficiency ” , which is denoted as 4 . INFORMATION FLOW MODEL BY LEVERAGING DIFFUSION RATE
In this section , we review some related background on Continuous Time Markov Chain . We then propose our rate based information flow model based on the foundation of ContinuousTime Markov Chain . Afterwards we discuss how to utilize the model for generating recommendations and ranking users . 4.1 Continuous Time Markov Chain

A Continuous Time Markov Chain satisfies the Markov property and takes value from a discrete state space . The Markov property 0 + > > , the conditional probability states that at any times distribution of the process at time t s+ given the whole history of the process up to and including time t , depends only on the state of the process at time t [ 28 ] . In this paper , we assume the transition probabilities are independent from the initial time t , which means the chain is time homogeneous and we denote ijP s as the transition probability from i to j over s time period .

In a summary , in a CTMC , the process makes a transition from one state to another , after it has spent an amount of time – state staying time , on the state it starts from . This state staying time is exponentially distributed with some rate . When the process leaves one state , it will next enter another state with some probability independent of the time spent at the previous state . Similar as for the “ cell phone adoption ” example , the rate and the transition probability are essential and well captured factors in the CTMC . In this paper , we propose a rate based information flow model based on the CTMC framework . 4.2 Rate based Information Flow Model
In this subsection , we propose a rate based information flow G n w τ based on the CTMC , in which model on a network each node is a state , the weight is represented as the transition probability , and the delay is represented as the staying time in each state . Figure 2 illustrates an example of our model . We assume that the information stays in a node i for a certain time period iT before making a transition to others . Then information flows transition probabilities ijP , to other nodes ikP , and ilP . l according j , k , and to

4.3 Recommendation Algorithm
Assume we have user adoption data on N users and M items . We model user adoption behaviors by our proposed rate based

Specifically , given the detailed log data , including the timestamp of each adoption , for each pair of users , we calculate the out state rate and transition probability by comparing their adoption timestamps on the same items . Following the steps listed in Figure 3 , we generate a rate based information flow model for the user adoption data .
For the recommendation problem , given at time t=0 , user i adopts an item , then the information starts to flow from this user to others in the network . We predict users’ preferences of information by estimating who will most likely adopt the item by time t τ= , in other words , information will flow to them . To predict users’ preferences by time t τ= , we estimate the probability that the information flows from user i to others as the ]0,τ ) i probability that transition → ) i τ , which is the ( j th element in ,i | , as ττ = ∫ ( ) transition probability matrix with

Similarly we assume we are given the user adoption data as described in Section 43 For the ranking problem , we pose the problem as if an arbitrary user j ( adopts an item at t=0 , when will be the average time in which user i adopts it ?

In this section , we first describe the datasets used to evaluate our algorithms . We observe how information flow model captures user adoption patterns . Following that , we analyze the diffusion time from global and structural perspectives . Afterwards , we demonstrate the experimental results on both recommendation and ranking .
5.1 Experiment Set Up
We demonstrate our proposed algorithms on two datasets . The first dataset is collected from NEC ’s “ EigyoRyoku 21 ” ( denoted as ER and stands for Sales Force in Japanese ) system . The ER system is a knowledgebase to support sales staffs with registered documents that include articles , slides , etc . We collected a thirtymonth period of clickstream log files from April 1 2004 to September 19 2006 covering 3,528 users and 31,379 documents . Nine user actions are identified : {"Login" , "Register_Feedback" , "Preview" , "Search" , "Register" , "Update" , "Delete"} . The clickstream log is partitioned into sessions that start with “ login ” followed by a sequence of user actions . The timestamps of users’ actions as well as the disclosure of the documents are included in the dataset . In this paper , we assume if a user accesses a document ( including "Preview" , "Abstract" or "Download" ) , he or she has adopted it .
"Document Download" ,
"Abstract" ,
The second dataset is MovieLens dataset [ 4 ] , which consists of 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies made by 6,040 MovieLens users who joined MovieLens in 2000 . Each user has rated at least 20 movies . We assume the user has adopted the movie as long as this user ever provided a rate on the movie . 5.2 User Adoption Patterns
Based on ER dataset , we simulate the user adoption process to illustrate user adoption patterns . Figure 6 illustrates the adoption process on one document . We first cluster users into five groups according to Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory [ 1 ] ( the user clusters from the left to the right are innovators , early adopters , early majority , late majority and laggards respectively ) according to how early their adoptions are in the dataset . These user groups are illustrated as half rings in the figure . Each node represents a user , with user ID as the label . When a document is disclosed and users start to adopt it , we mark the nodes of these users as red shaded boxes accordingly based on the user ’s relative adoption time . We do observe consistent sequential patterns from user adoption data , which confirm that information flows from innovators to early adopters , early majority , late majority , until laggards .
Figure 6 : Visualization on user adoption patterns . This series captures the fact that after one document being disclosed ( the small rectangular on the left side ) , how users adopt it over time . Each node represents a user , with user ID as the label . The nodes are marked by red shaded boxes when the corresponding users adopt the document
5.3 Diffusion Time : Case Study
To analyze how the information flows in different rates in these two datasets , we study the distributions of global diffusion time , and structural diffusion time .
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Mining in Social Networks196 531 Global Diffusion Time
We define the global diffusion time as how long it takes that information spreads through the population . This concept is in the inverse proportion of the global diffusion rate which has been captured in diffusion of innovation theory [ 6 ] and Bass model [ 15 ] .
For both datasets , we ranked the user adoption behaviors by the adoption time . The global diffusion time is calculated as the difference of the disclosure time and the adoption time , keeping the relative position unchanged . Intuitively , we expect there are a larger amount of adoptions at the beginning and followed with decay because the value of the items decays over time . Figures 7(a ) and ( b ) illustrate how the number of adoptions of the items changes over time . It does confirm our expectation . A large amount of adoptions take place at the early stage when the items are just disclosed , rapidly decaying afterwards for both datasets . To illustrate the decay rate , we fit the data to an exponential function ,
( 26 ) b X ⋅ exp
Y
= a
(
)
As indicated by the coefficient of exponential fit , the decay rate in the ER dataset ( b = 0.0018 ) is similar as that in the MovieLens dataset ( b = 00019 )
To further analyze how the information diffuses over time , we utilize the Bass model [ 15 ] , which quantifies the adoption of innovations by estimating the introduction and acceptance rate variables . Figures 7 ( c ) and ( d ) illustrate how the Bass model fits two datasets by using Equation ( 1 ) . Comparing the innovation coefficients of these two cases , ( p = 0.2748 for ER and p = 0.0756 for MovieLens ) , we can tell that ER system has higher percentage of innovators than MovieLens system , which is reasonable because the documents in ER system are more timesensitive than the movies in MovieLens system . we still have no clue on how the information flows to different nodes in the network without looking into the structural level . 532 Structural Diffusion Time
We define the structural diffusion times as those diffusion times which take the network structure into account . The structural diffusion times include inter personal diffusion time , which we define as how long it takes that information spreads from one node to another , and state staying time , which is defined in Section 41 In this paper , we make the same assumption as we did in [ 5 ] : the fact that two users access the same item sequentially is modeled as an information flow process : the information is flowing from early adopters to late adopters .
For both datasets , we calculate the difference of adoption time of each pair of users on the same item as the inter personal diffusion time . For each pair of users , we take the average over the common items both users adopt to indicate how rapidly the information flows from one user to another on average . Figures 8 ( a ) and ( b ) illustrate the distributions of the average inter personal diffusion time in ER and MovieLens datasets . For both datasets , the average inter personal diffusion times vary from several days to several hundred days . We also study the distribution of state staying time at each user . For each user , we calculate the adoption time difference of him/her and others and take the average to indicate how rapidly the information flows out from this node to others . Figures 8 ( c ) and ( d ) illustrate the distributions of the average state staying time in ER and MovieLens datasets . Again , for both datasets , the average state staying times vary from several days to several hundred days . The variety reminds us of the example of “ cell phone adoption ” . In real situations , some users more efficiently influence other users than some others do . Users with similar properties as the “ father ” and “ grandmother ” do exist . How to differentiate them will affect various applications such as recommendation and ranking .

To look closer , Figure 9 provides the individual cases for the state staying time . Figures 9(a ) and ( b ) compare the state staying time for user 3526 and user 2433 on ER dataset . The state staying time for user 3526 ranges from one day to around 80 days ; while
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Mining in Social Networks197 for user 2433 , it ranges from one day to more than 800 days . Thus , on average , user 3526 influences others much more efficiently than user 2433 . The similar conclusion can be drawn by comparing the state staying time of user 2292 and user 2980 on MovieLens dataset as illustrated in Figures 9(c ) and ( d ) . Also we can see that modeling of the state staying time as exponential distribution is reasonable , although not perfect .

5.4 Recommendation Performance
To demonstrate the performance of our recommendation algorithm , for the ER dataset , we first divide both datasets into two sets : the training set and the test set . The data from April 2004 to April 2005 serve as the training data , and the data from May to July 2005 serve as the test data . To exclude casual users who had very few activities , we selected 1170 active users who adopted more than 50 documents in the training period ; and more than 10 documents in the test period in our experiments . In total , there are 23,894 documents involved in this selected dataset . 201,750 adoption actions were recorded . The average number of adoption actions per user is 172 , and the average number of actions per document is 8 . For the MovieLens dataset , we select first 80 % as the training set and later 20 % as the test set .
In the experiments , we simulate the situation of adoption behaviors . There are 586 documents disclosed during the test period from May to July 2005 . The mean value of the number of users who adopted these 586 documents during May to July 2005 is 18 . These documents were first adopted by one or multiple users – innovators . We then predict who else will most likely adopt the documents following these early adopters within 30 days . This strategy is suitable service or advertisement – recommending the items to potential customers according to the choices of innovators . It can also be used in the traditional recommendation scenario by estimating how likely one user will be interested in the documents and recommending those top ranked items to him/her . for online document/product pushing
To evaluate the accuracy of predictions , we measure the average the percentage of them who are actually interested in the item among the recommended users . recommendation accuracy , which represents
In our experiments , we compare the performance of the following algorithms :
1 . Collaborative Filtering based on Cosine Similarity ( baseline )
( denoted as Cosine )
2 . Early adoption based information flow model as proposed in
[ 5 ] ( denoted as EABIF )
3 . Rate based information flow model ( proposed in this paper , and denoted as RIF ) Figure 10 compares the average recommendation accuracy of Collaborative Filtering based on Cosine Similarity ( labeled by CF ) , early adoption based information flow model ( labeled by EABIF ) and rate based information flow model ( labeled by RIF ) on both ER ( (a)–(c ) ) and MovieLens datasets ( (d) (e) ) . We demonstrate the results in the situations when one or multiple users adopted the item within 30 days . In both datasets , RIF beats CF and EABIF . In ER dataset , RIF improves accuracy by 67 % comparing to CF , and 20 % comparing to EABIF . In MovieLens dataset , RIF improves accuracy by 80 % comparing to CF , and 53 % comparing to EABIF . We also find that for MovieLens dataset , given the recommendation time as 30 day , sometimes the EABIF algorithm can not perform as well as CF does . The reason is that EABIF looks for potential users in a much longer duration – sometimes these potential users are laggards ( “ grandma ” in our cell phone adoption example ) . However , the interest of these laggards on the item may have not been triggered yet during a short time period like 30 days .

5.5 Ranking Performance
To demonstrate the performance of our ranking algorithm , we compare the performance of the following algorithms :
1 . PageRank ( with the damping factor as 0.85 ) 2 . HITS 3 . DiffusionRank ( our proposed algorithm )
Table 1 and Table 2 show the top 10 ranked users in ER and MovieLens datasets using these algorithms . To further analyze the result , we illustrate the in node diffusion time for 1st ranked user in PageRank , and DiffusionRank in Figure 11 . We define the in node diffusion time as how long it takes that information flows from other nodes to this particular node . The in node diffusion time is an important indicator which is related to the flow efficiency to a particular node although not the only one . We can see that on average , the in node diffusion time for the 1st ranked user in DiffusionRank ( Figure 11(b ) ) is much smaller than that of the 1st ranked in PageRank and HITS ( Figure 11(a) ) . This demonstrates that the information flows more rapidly to these users who ranked higher in DiffusionRank than to these higher ranked in PageRank and HITS . A similar conclusion can be drawn from the result on MovieLens dataset ( Figures 11(c ) and ( d) ) .

6 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
Social influence is the process whereby people directly or indirectly influence the thoughts , feelings and actions of others . PageRank and HITS use the hyperlink structure of the web pages to determine their “ importance ” . Word of mouth marketing and recommendation is another way of leveraging social influences .
WWW 2007 / Track : Data MiningSession : Mining in Social Networks199 However , none of these approaches take the diffusion rates in the network into account .
In this paper , we propose a novel Information Flow model that captures the diffusion rates of information in a network . By modeling the diffusion of information flow , we can tackle two refined problems in recommendation and ranking . First , we can measure how likely information will flow from a specific sender to a specific receiver within a limited time , and thus predict who will be in a recommendation . Second , we can estimate the expected time for information to diffuse to a particular user in the network , and thus rank users based on how quickly information will travel to them . likely recipients of information the most
Our recommendation and ranking algorithms use the transient transition probability and the mean first passage time in a Continuous Time Markov Chain . Consequently , we can address the diffusion efficiency of information flow on the inter personal and individual levels . ranking of traditional Collaborative Filtering and
In our experiments , the diffusion efficiency of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated for both the prediction of automatic recommendations and influential users . For recommendation , we chose a recommendation period of 30 days . Compared with the uniform diffusion information flow model ( EABIF ) , our ratebased information flow ( RIF ) algorithm improves 67 % and 20 % respectively for recommendation accuracy in the ER dataset . In the MovieLens dataset , RIF improves accuracy by 80 % comparing to CF , and 53 % comparing to EABIF . Furthermore compared with PageRank and HITS algorithms , our proposed DiffusionRank ranks users based on how efficiently information will flow to them in the network .
Ongoing work includes formally defining “ influence ” between users and conducting our proposed algorithms on datasets with explicit links , such as blog datasets , to track the influence flow . Also , some recent evidences demonstrate that heavy tailed statistics happen in some human actions [ 22 25 ] . Thus , another direction is to estimate the state staying time by hyper exponential distribution to fit the heavy tailed distribution . Then we can build the rate based information flow model based on semi Markov process [ 29 ] . 7 . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
