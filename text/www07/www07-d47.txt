ABSTRACT In this paper , we study a new problem of mining causal relation of queries in search engine query logs . Causal relation between two queries means event on one query is the causation of some event on the other . We first detect events in query logs by efficient statistical frequency threshold . Then the causal relation of queries is mined by the geometric features of the events . Finally the Granger Causality Test ( GCT ) is utilized to further re rank the causal relation of queries according to their GCT coefficients . In addition , we develop a 2 dimensional visualization tool to display the detected relationship of events in a more intuitive way . The experimental results on the MSN search engine query logs demonstrate that our approach can accurately detect the events in temporal query logs and the causal relation of queries is detected effectively .

1 . INTRODUCTION Owing to the great potential to improve the performance of search engine and uncover the personal behavior habits of the users , query log analysis has attracted much attention in both academic and industrial area . However , to the best of our knowledge , no work has noticed the fact that a sharp increase of one query ’s submitting frequency may indicate the increase of another query ’s , namely , there may exist causal relation between different queries . In this paper we study a new problem of mining causal relation between different queries based on the time series data extracted from query logs . If a query is submitted much more often than normally , it usually means that a specific event related to this query the underlying causal relationships , we present a system , in which the events are extracted from each query time series ( QTS ) followed by the Event Causality Test ( ECT ) , and then the causal relation is re ranked by Granger Causality Test ( GCT ) . is happening . To uncover

2.1 Causal Relations Causal relation is also referred to as cause and effect relation , which is one of the basic relation types in ontology . If one query ’s change always causes another query ’s change within a time period ,

Definition 1 . A causally precedes B if the following conditions hold : ( 1 ) A and B are in the same process and A was executed before B ; ( 2 ) There exists C such that A causally precedes C and C causally precedes B . And we note this relationship as A Bp .
Granger Causality Test ( GCT ) was first proposed by Clive W . J . Granger in 1969 [ 1 ] and popularized by Sims at [ 2 ] which provided a statistic method to judge if two variables have causal relation . Although GCT may provide causal relations with high confidence , we cannot directly use it due to its high computational complexity . The complexity is
O mn
(

) for building the whole causal relation graph , where m is the length of the time series and n is the query number . In this way , we propose an efficient method called Event Causality Test ( ECT ) method to filter a large number of unrelated queries for a given query , which calculates the causal relation coefficient between queries by the queries associated with events .
2.2 Event Model of Queries The sharply increasing of query frequency in time series means that some events happened . For instance , after Microsoft released Windows Vista , the query “ Vista ” is used much more frequently within a period of time . There appears a peak in the time series of query “ Vista ” . Thus the burst in the query frequency time series is often an intuitive representation of some real events . Mathematically , we define events as :
Definition 2 ( Events ) : an event qe on a query q is a period in which its search frequency is above a given threshold bf , and at least the frequency at one time point during the period is above a given threshold cf . Climaxes of an event are query frequencies that are above cf , and whose values are the maximal within a certain neighborhood . We denote the ith event on q as q ie .
The first threshold bf is a baseline that can determine the event cf is the climax threshold that period , and the second threshold can pick out the periods with large influence . We represent events > , where id is the ID of the event ; as :
=< q e t
, t
,
, ts c c
, id t b e bt and time that climax happens ; and et are the start time and end time of the event ; ct is the ct . is the time period that the event lasts , and cts is the time series value at t− b is a good indicator of the importance of the event .
Thus t e

× ts c

The probability of

3 . EXSPRIMENTS The dataset we used here was collected from MSN search engine ( http://searchmsncom/ ) The dataset is a daily aggregation of users’ submitting frequency for each query , from December 2nd , 2003 to August 8th , 2005 , 625 days in total . To get the overall quality comparison , we sample 150 queries from the dataset , and apply ECT and ECT GCT methods on them . We ask eight people to label the top 100 results ( include the input query ) obtained by the ECT method , and thus we can get the accumulated precision graph as in Figure 2 . The x coordinate of Figure 2 means the top k position , where k is from 1 to 99 ( the input query is excluded , for we can’t apply GCT to the totally the same two time series as this will cause singular matrix ) . The y coordinate is the accumulated precision calculated top k as : #(label as 1 in top results ) position , which at is a k k

4 . CONCLUSION In this paper , we studied a new problem of detecting causal relation between queries based on query time series data extracted from search engine query logs . An effective and efficient method was proposed to solve this problem by using the event information involved in each query time series . To further improve the precision of the causal relation , GCT was implemented to re rank the top k results . The experimental results show that the integrated ECT GCT approach provided encouraging results , and it greatly outperformed ECT with a reasonably higher complexity .

Step 1 . Finding : using 3σ rule of Gaussian distribution to detect a group of event candidates based on the Definition 2 . Step 2 . Merging : if they share the same appearing period , we will combine them . Step 3 . Splitting : if the frequency at 0t between two climaxes below a threshold sf , the ending time of the first event will be 0t and the second event ’s beginning time will also be set as set as 0t .
