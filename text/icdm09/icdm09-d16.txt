1 Introduction
In this paper , we propose a framework for knowledge discovery from unstructured text based on the synergistic combination of two visually appealing discovery techniques known as , Formal Concept Analysis ( FCA ) [ 10 , 11 ] and Emergent Self Organizing Maps ( ESOM ) [ 2 , 5 ] . The framework recognizes the important role of the domain expert in mining real world enterprise applications and makes efficient use of specific domain knowledge , including human intelligence and domain specific constraints .
FCA arose twenty five years ago as a mathematical theory [ 10 , 15 ] and has over the years grown into a powerful tool for data analysis , data visualization and information retrieval [ 12 , 13 ] . We complement the knowledge discovery based on FCA with a special type of topographic map known as ESOM . The ESOM functions as a catalyst for the FCA based discovery . A key contribution of this paper is that we ground the knowledge discovery approach based on FCA and ESOM in the theoretical foundation of C K theory . C K theory is used to give a clear structure to the discovery process based on FCA and ESOM .
We apply the presented framework to a real life case study using data from the Amsterdam Amstelland police . The case zooms in on the problem of distilling concepts for domestic violence from the unstructured text in police reports . These concepts are used to iteratively enrich the actionable knowledge available to police officers for recognizing cases of domestic violence . Domestic violence is one of the top priorities of the Amsterdam Amstelland police force [ 19 ] . Unfortunately , in the past intensive audits of the police databases related to filed reports established that many police reports tended to be wrongly labelled as domestic or as non domestic violence cases .
In this paper , we demonstrate that by applying the discovery framework to the unstructured text in police reports we can obtain essential knowledge for upgrading the definition and understanding of the domestic violence phenomenon , and for improving its management . In addition , we show how early detection of domestic violence could be automated .
The remainder of this paper is composed as follows . In section 2 , we introduce the data exploration techniques of FCA and ESOM . In section 3 , we discuss the dataset . In section 4 , we elaborate on the knowledge discovery process , apply it to the data set at hand , and report results . Section 5 concludes the paper .
2 . Exploration techniques
According to RS Brachman and T . Anand [ 17 ] much attention and effort has been focused on the development of data mining techniques , but only minor effort has been devoted to the development of tools that support the analyst in the overall discovery task . The authors argue for a more human centered approach . Human centered KDD refers to the constitutive character of human interpretation for the discovery of knowledge , and stresses the complex , interactive process of KDD as being led by human thought . This can only be achieved by tools that offer highly interactive user interfaces that continuously engage human control over the information seeking process [ 16 ] . According to Brachman et al . [ 18 ] this is best embedded into a knowledge discovery support environment . FCA and ESOM are particularly suited for exploratory data analysis because of their human centeredness . FCA and ESOM offer the user intuitive visual displays of different types of structures available in the dataset and guide the user in its exploration .
2.1 Formal Concept Analysis
The starting point of the analysis is a database table consisting of rows M ( ie objects ) , columns F ( ie attributes ) and crosses T M F ( ie relationships between objects and attributes ) . The mathematical structure used to reference such a cross table is called a formal context ( M , F , T ) . In our case , reports of domestic violence ( ie the objects ) are related ( ie the crosses ) to a number of terms ( ie the attributes ) ; here a report is related to a term if the report contains this term . Given a formal context , FCA then derives all concepts from this context and orders them according to a subconcept superconcept relation . This results in a line diagram ( aka lattice ) .
⊆
×
The notion of concept is central to FCA . The way FCA looks at concepts is in line with the international standard ISO 704 , that formulates the following definition : A concept is considered to be a unit of thought constituted of two parts : its extension and its intension , [ 10 , 11 ] . The extension consists of all objects belonging to the concept , while the intension comprises all attributes shared by those objects . For a set of objects O M⊆
, the common features can be identified , written

Take the attributes that describe a report from the dataset used in this paper , for example . By collecting all reports of this context that share these attributes , we get to a set O M⊆ consisting of reports . This set O of objects is closely connected to set A consisting of attributes = ∈ i M f

In other words , O is the set of all objects sharing all attributes of A , and A is the set of all attributes that are valid descriptions for all the objects contained in O . Each such pair ( O , A ) is called a formal concept ( or concept ) of the given context . The set is called the extent of the concept ( O , A is called the intent , while

There is a natural hierarchical ordering relation between the concepts of a given is context that is called the subconcept superconcept relation . A concept d

( or equivalently , e is called a superconcept of a concept d ) if and only if the extent of d is a subset of the extent of e ( or equivalently , if and only if the intent of d is a superset of the intent of e ) , or

( The set of all concepts of a formal context combined with the subconceptsuperconcept relation defined for these concepts gives rise to the mathematical structure of a complete lattice , called the concept lattice of the context . The latter is made accessible to human reasoning by using the representation of a ( labelled ) line diagram .
In section 4 of this paper , a line diagram is displayed . We use the following conventions . The circles or nodes in the line diagram represent the formal concepts . The diagram displays only concepts that describe objects and is therefore a subpart of the concept lattice . The shaded boxes ( upward ) linked to a node represent the attributes used to name the concept . The non shaded boxes ( downward ) linked to the node represent the objects used to name the concept . The information contained in the concept lattice can be distilled from the line diagram by applying the following reading rule : An object “ g ” is described by an attribute “ m ” if and only if there is an ascending path from the node named by “ g ” to the node named by “ m ” .
Retrieving the extension of a formal concept from a line diagram implies collecting all objects on all paths leading down from the corresponding node . To retrieve the intension of a formal concept one traces all paths leading up from the corresponding node in order to collect all attributes . The top and bottom concepts in the lattice are special . The top concept contains all objects in its extension . The bottom concept contains all attributes in its intension . A concept is a subconcept of all concepts that can be reached by travelling upward . This concept will inherit all attributes associated with these superconcepts .
2.2 Emergent Self Organizing Map
Emergent Self Organizing Maps ( ESOM ) [ 2 ] are a special class of topographic maps [ 7 ] . ESOM is argued to be especially useful for visualizing sparse , high dimensional datasets , yielding an intuitive overview of its structure [ 6 ] . Topographic maps perform a non linear mapping of the high dimensional data space to a low dimensional one , usually a two dimensional space , which enables the visualization and exploration of the data [ 4 ] . ESOM is a more recent type of topographic map . According to Ultsch [ 5 ] , “ emergence is the ability of a system to produce a phenomenon on a new , higher level ” . In order to achieve emergence , the existence and cooperation of a large number of elementary processes is necessary . An emergent SOM differs from a traditional SOM in that a very large number of neurons ( at least a few thousands ) are used [ 3 ] . In the traditional SOM , the number of nodes is too small to show emergence .
The ESOM map is composed of a set of neurons I , arranged in a hex grid map iw W∈ and iw p consisting of a weight vector
I∈ is a tuple ( structure . A neuron i

, i a position ip

The produced map maintains the neighborhood relationships that are present in the input space and can be used to visually detect clusters . It also provides the analyst with an idea of the complexity of the dataset , the distribution of the dataset ( eg spherical ) , and the amount of overlap between different classes of objects . Finally , only a minimal amount of expert knowledge is required for an analyst to start use it effectively for exploratory data analysis . An additional advantage of an ESOM is that it can be trained directly on the available dataset without first having to perform a feature selection procedure [ 5 ] . ESOM maps can be created and used for data analysis by means of the publicly available Databionics ESOM Tool [ 8 ] .
3 . Dataset
Our dataset consists of a selection of 4814 police reports describing a whole range of violent incidents from the year 2007 . All domestic violence cases from that period are a subset of this dataset . The selection came about amongst others by filtering out police reports that did not contain the reporting of a crime by a victim , which is necessary for establishing domestic violence . This happens , for example , when a police officer is sent to investigate an incident , afterwards writes a report in which he/she mentions his/her findings , but the victim ends up never making an official statement to the police . The follow up reports referring to previous cases were also removed . Of those 4814 reports , 1657 were classified by police officers as domestic violence .
We also used a validation data set for our experiment . It consists of a selection of 4738 cases describing a whole range of violent incidents from the year 2006 where the victim made a statement to the police . Again , the follow up reports were removed . 1734 of these 4738 cases were classified as domestic violence by police officers .
4 . Iterative knowledge discovery with FCA and ESOM
In this section , we elaborate on the applied process for knowledge discovery based on the synergistic combination of the visually appealing discovery techniques presented in section 2 . In this setup , FCA is used as a concept generation engine , distilling formal concepts from the unstructured text documents described in section 3 . We complement this knowledge discovery with the capabilities of ESOM , which functions as a catalyst for the FCA based knowledge extraction . To frame our approach to knowledge discovery we make use of C K theory .
C K theory is a unified design theory that defines design reasoning dynamics as a joint expansion of the Concept ( C ) and Knowledge ( K ) spaces through a series of continuous transformations within and between the two spaces [ 1 ] . The theory makes a formal distinction between concepts and knowledge : the K space consists of propositions with logical status ( ie either true or false ) for a designer , and the C space consists of propositions without logical status in the knowledge space . According to Hatchuel et al . [ 1 ] , concepts are candidates to be transformed into propositions of K but are not themselves elements of K .
From the point of knowledge discovery in data , the K space could be viewed as composed of actionable information . It contains the existing knowledge used to operate and steer in the action environment . The C space , on the other hand , is considered as the design space . Whereas K is used as the basis for action and decision making , C puts this actionability under scrutiny for potential improvement and learning . The transformations within and between the C and K spaces are accomplished by the application of four transformation operators : C → K , K → C , C → C , and K → K . These transformations form what is referred to as the design square , which fundamentally provides structure to the design process . At the basis of the knowledge discovery process are iterations through the design square . The knowledge discovery documented in this paper was driven by a data analyst and a domain expert , who collaborated intensely and continuously interacted with the visual exploration tools . They immersed themselves in a process of iterating through the transformation operators of the design square . This process is summarized in Figure 1 .
Fig 1 . Design square in action
In this case , the process in Figure 1 works as follows :
• The process starts with the data analyst constructing an initial FCA lattice and ESOM map using the police reports contained in the dataset , and the terms contained in a thesaurus ( ie K → C ) . The thesaurus was refined after each iteration of re indexing the reports and visualizing and analyzing the data with the FCA lattice and ESOM maps .
• The FCA lattice and the ESOM map provide a reduced search space to the domain expert , who then visually inspects and analyses the lattice and map ( ie C → C ) . In other words , the FCA lattice and ESOM map are used in the capacity of information browser .
• Based on anomalies and counter intuitive elements found by analyzing the lattice , or using ESOM to pinpoint outliers , clusters and areas of the map containing a mixtures of case types , police reports can be selected for in depth manual inspection ( ie C → K ) .
• These police reports are in turn used , for example , to discover new referential terms to improve the thesaurus , to enrich and validate prior domain knowledge , to discover new classification rules , and for operational validation ( ie K → K ) .
The obtained results , together with the relevant prior knowledge of the domain expert are then incorporated into the existing visual representation , resulting in a new lattice and ESOM map ( ie K → C ) for starting a new iteration of the design square .
In the remainder of this section we limit ourselves to illustrating how ESOM and FCA help to operationalise the four design cube operators that constitute the knowledge discovery process .
4.1 Transforming : K C
The definition of domestic violence employed by the police organization of the Netherlands is as follows : “ Domestic violence can be characterized as serious acts of violence committed by someone in the domestic sphere of the victim . Violence includes all forms of physical assault . The domestic sphere includes all partners , expartners , family members , relatives and family friends of the victim . The notion of family friend includes persons that have a friendly relationship with the victim and ( regularly ) meet with the victim in his/her home [ 16 ] . ”
The lattice structure in Figure 2 was fundamentally influenced by this domestic violence definition . Prior to the analysis with FCA , certain terms were clustered in term clusters based on this definition and added to a thesaurus . For example , to verify whether a criminal offence has occurred , reports were searched for terms such as “ hit ” , “ stab ” and “ kick ” . These terms were grouped into the term cluster “ acts of violence ” . Another term cluster , for example , verified whether a person from the domestic sphere of the victim was involved in the crime . In this case , reports were searched for terms such as “ my dad ” , “ my ex boyfriend ” , and “ my uncle ” . These terms were grouped into the term cluster “ persons of domestic sphere ” .
Using the reference definition of domestic violence employed by the police was but one way to come up with term clusters to structure the lattice in Figure 2 . Term clusters also emerged from in depth scanning of certain reports highlighted during a knowledge iteration cycle . This is the way , for example , in which the term cluster
“ relational problems ” was created . Terms in that cluster made reference to a broken relationship . In depth scanning of reports is also the way in which we found that many cases did not have a formally labelled suspect . Thus , we incorporated the attribute “ no suspect ” into the lattice . Reports that were assigned the label “ domestic violence ” had been classified as such by police officers . The remaining reports were classified as non domestic violence .
Fig 2 . Lattice based on the police reports from 2007
Some 123 elements were collected into an initial thesaurus . This gathering process was not only influenced by the above domestic violence definition , but also incorporated information from other prior knowledge sources such as expert advice . Indexing the set of 4814 reports from 2007 with this thesaurus resulted in a data set ( ie reports are objects and thesaurus elements are object attributes ) for training a toroidal ESOM map . The latter is presented in Figure 3 . The green squares refer to neurons that dominantly contain non domestic violence cases , while the red squares refer to neurons that dominantly contain domestic violence cases .

4.2 Expanding : C C
The notion of expansion plays a key role in C K theory . An analysts ability to recognize an expansion opportunity depends on his sensitivity to these opportunities , his training , and the knowledge at his disposal . We argue here that FCA and ESOM help analysts recognize and exploit these opportunities . Basically , C space expansion is driven by the analyst spotting and investigating anomalies , outliers and concept gaps from these visual exploration tools . For example , the FCA lattice in Figure 2 allowed us to make some interesting observations associated with the data at hand . We use the numbers in Table 1 to illustrate .
Table 1 . Interesting observations from the lattice in Figure 2

128 63
863

60 18
72
365
From Table 1 it is clear that a total of 60 domestic violence cases did not contain a term from the “ acts of violence ” term cluster . Of these 60 cases , 18 contained a term from the cluster containing terms referring to a person in the domestic sphere of the victim . Interestingly , some 28 % ( ie 863 ) of the non domestic violence reports only contain terms from the “ acts of violence ” cluster , while there are only 72 domestic violence reports in the dataset that share that characteristic . Apparently , some cases that were labelled as domestic violence did not fit with the definition of domestic violence that was used to start this discovery exercise in the first place . The associated reports were therefore selected for in depth investigation .
Zooming in onto the term cluster “ relational problems ” we observed some more interesting facts . Apparently , only 58 non domestic violence reports contained one or more terms from that cluster . We concluded that the presence of at least one of the terms from this cluster in a police report seemed to be a strong indication for domestic violence . This was enough evidence to warrant manual inspection of these 58 police reports .
Visual inspection of the patterns laid down by the ESOM map in Figure 3 also allowed us to make interesting observations . For example , using colour coding made it easy to spot outlying observations , that is , red squares located in the middle of a large group of green squares , and vice versa . For inspection we made use of the ESOM tool ’s functionality to select neurons for displaying the cases that had these neurons as best match . We thought that these neurons were associated with cases that might have been wrongly classified by police officers .
4.3 Transforming : C K
The C → K operator transforms concepts in C into logical questions in K . An answer to such a question is in our case found by manually inspecting selected police reports . We refer to this manual analysis as the validation of concept gaps , giving rise to multiple types of discoveries : confusing situations , new referential terms , faulty case labellings , niche cases , and data quality problems .
For example , and with reference to Table 1 , the 18 domestic violence cases that contained a term from the cluster “ persons of domestic sphere ” but no violence term were selected for manual investigation . In depth analysis showed that these reports contained violence related terms , such as “ abduction ” , “ strangle ” and “ deprivation of liberty ” , that were originally lacking from the initial thesaurus . Another example , are the 42 cases that did not contain a violence term or a term referring to a person of the domestic sphere . These cases turned out to be wrongly classified as domestic violence .
Table 1 also indicates that there were 58 police reports that were classified as nondomestic violence while containing a term from the “ relational problems ” cluster . Investigation revealed that a startling 95 % of these cases had been wrongly labelled as non domestic violence . Moreover , about 70 % of these cases had in common that a third person made a statement to the police for someone else . Moreover , analysis of the remaining 30 % led to the discovery of an important new concept that turned out to be lacking from the domain expert ’s initial understanding of domestic violence . Many of the reports included expressions such as “ I was attacked by the ex boyfriend of my girlfriend ” and “ I was maltreated by the ex girlfriend of my boyfriend ” . This gave rise to a term cluster “ attack by ex person against new friend ” that would be added to the thesaurus .
We also went after novel and potentially interesting classification attributes . The fact of not making mention of a suspect in a report is such an attribute . This can be inferred from the FCA lattice in Figure 2 . It shows how some 34 % of the reports ( 1623 cases ) did not mention a suspect . However , going back to our original definition of domestic violence , which talked about a perpetrator belonging to the domestic sphere of the victim , an offender thus had to be known for a valid labelling of domestic violence . However , the lattice in Figure 1 shows that 181 of these “ no suspect ” cases were actually labelled as domestic violence , which led us to further investigate these reports .
Some of the ESOM outliers also helped us to enrich the K space . Inspection of these outlier cases helped us to enrich the thesaurus . Some of the features that constituted this enrichment are mentioned in Table 2 .
Table 2 . Thesaurus features discovered by exploring ESOM outliers pepper spray homosexual relationship , lesbian relationship sexual abuse , incest alternative spelling of some words ( eg ex boyfriend , exboyfriend , ex boyfriend ) weapons lacking in the thesaurus : belt , kitchen knife , baseball bat , etc . terms referring to persons : partner , fiancée , mistress , concubine , man next door , etc . terms referring to relationships : love affair , marriage problems , divorce proceedings , etc . reception centers : woman ’s refuge center , home for battered woman , etc . gender of the perpetrator : mostly male gender of the victim : mostly female age of the perpetrator : mostly older than 18 years and younger than 45 years age of the victim : mostly older than 18 years and younger than 45 years terms referring to an extra marital affair : I have an another man , lover , I am unfaithful , etc .
Many of the reports also contained confusing situations that upon disclosure were used to refine the notion of domestic violence .
4.4 Expanding : K K
This expansion of the K space constitutes validation or testing of the proposed expansion with the ultimate goal of producing actionable intelligence . K validation of a concept comes down to a confrontation of the output from the C K transformation with a selection of knowledge sources available to the K space ( eg cross checking with other databases , setting up field experiments , soliciting expert advice ) .
For example , analysis of the misclassified reports of which we made mention in the previous section showed that apparently , for some unknown reason , police officers regularly misclassified burglary , car theft , bicycle theft and street robbery cases as domestic violence . To consolidate the agreement on this kind of mistake a new term cluster was introduced that would not only influence subsequent iterating through the design square , but police reporting itself by addressing it during police training . The latter would also elaborate on what seemed to be confusing situations to police officers in terms of labelling cases correctly ( eg when third persons make statements for someone else ) .
In the previous section , we also described how the analysis of police reports revealed interesting cases in which the ex boyfriend attacked the new boyfriend . We presented these doubtful cases to the board members responsible for the domestic violence policy . Police officers and policy makers confirmed that this type of situation was indeed to be seen as domestic violence , mainly because the perpetrator often aims at emotionally hurting the ex partner . Consequently , the expectation was for the terms contained in this cluster to relatively frequently occur in cases labelled as domestic violence reports . However , this assumption turned out to be incorrect when scrutinizing the data . Police officers clearly had trouble allocating a correct label to these kind of cases , which anew gave rise to a need for training
The ” no suspect ” cases were yet another example of the potential for knowledge expansion . Remember that some of the cases that were labelled as domestic violence by police officers did not make mention of a suspect , which was weird . Studying the way in which police officers registered victim reports helped us uncover some haphazard behaviour in the process . Apparently , while some officers immediately registered a suspect at the moment the victim mentioned this person as a suspect , others preferred to first interrogate these people before casting the label of suspect . In the latter cases , the person that was mentioned would then be added to the list of persons who were said to be involved in or to have witnessed the crime . These lists tended to account for a rather diverse and extensive set of people . Suspects easily got lost in these lists . When we inquired about the proper policy regarding the labelling of suspects , we were told there simply was none . This analysis made a strong case for such a policy .
In the process of digging up evidence and confronting the different stakeholders with that evidence we exposed a serious mismatch between the management ’s conception of domestic violence and that of police officers . We found that management employed a much broader definition of domestic violence than most police officers .
4.5 Actionable intelligence
Several iterations through the design cube resulted in truly valuable upgrades of the K space from the point of improving action in the field , that is , on the street . Some of the most important achievements of our work are the following :
• We were able to upgrade the definition for domestic violence that would act as a principle guideline for labelling cases .
• Several types of niche cases were identified as valid exceptions to the general definition , and advice , grounded in evidence , was formulated for policy redesign .
• We ended up extracting a set of 22 domestic violence and 15 non domestic violence classification rules . Using these rules , 75 % of cases from the year 2007 could be labelled automatically and correctly as either domestic or nondomestic violence . Validation of these results by applying these rules to the police reports from the year 2006 allowed us to obtain a similar performance at 72 % . These rules have been incorporated in an early case filter to identifying cases that warrant in depth manual inspection . Before , all claims had to be manually checked .
• The set of identified classification rules did not just allow the police to classify newly incoming cases . The rules could also be usefully employed to reclassify cases from the past to provide for more correct performance management and reporting over time . Domestic violence cases that were not recognized as such in the past might also be re opened for investigation .
5 . Conclusion
In this paper , we proposed an approach to knowledge discovery from unstructured text using FCA and ESOM . The approach was framed and illustrated with reference to C K theory ( ie the design square ) to provide for a deep understanding of the nature of the exploration ; an exploration that essentially is human centered . With this paper we argued for the discovery capabilities of FCA and ESOM , acting as information browsers in the hands of human analysts . The tools were shown to help analysts progress with knowledge expansion by progressively looping through the design square in an effective way . We showcased the framework using a real life case study with data from the Amsterdam Amstelland police . The case zoomed in on the problem of distilling concepts for domestic violence from the unstructured text in police reports . The data exploration for this case study resulted in several improvements related to the operational reporting on and the handling of domestic violence cases . This included the implementation of an effective early case filter to identify cases that truly warrant in depth manual inspection .
