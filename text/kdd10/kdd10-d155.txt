ABSTRACT Identifying hot spots of moving vehicles in an urban area is essential to many smart city applications . The practical research on hot spots in smart city presents many unique features , such as highly mobile environments , supremely limited size of sample objects , and the non uniform , biased samples . All these features have raised new challenges that make the traditional density based clustering algorithms fail to capture the real clustering property of objects , making the results less meaningful . In this paper we propose a novel , non density based approach called mobility based clustering . The key idea is that sample objects are employed as “ sensors ” to perceive the vehicle crowdedness in nearby areas using their instant mobility , rather than the “ object representatives ” . As such the mobility of samples is naturally incorporated . Several key factors beyond the vehicle crowdedness have been identified and techniques to compensate these effects are proposed . We evaluate the performance of mobility based clustering based on real traffic situations . Experimental results show that using 0.3 % of vehicles as the samples , mobility based clustering can accurately identify hot spots which can hardly be obtained by the latest representative algorithm UMicro .

INTRODUCTION
Identifying hot spots of moving vehicles in an urban area is essential to many smart city applications [ 1 ] . Informally , hot spots of vehicles can be described as areas of high crowdedness of vehicles . The hot spots with extremely high crowdedness are usually the sites of traffic congestions . An immediate application for hot spot study is that we can predict vehicle speeds based on the crowdedness distribution . Indeed , hot spots are often the potential sites of interests due to the higher likelihood of the events and opportunities ( eg , traffic jam , exhibitions , and commercial promotions ) .
In this work , we study the hot spot related issues using taxi ’s statistics as the sample data . We obtained the raw dataset from the City Traffic Bureau of a major city in China [ 1 , 27 ] . The ultimate goal of this research is to have a better understanding of the city traffic via a quantitative research on hot spots . To do so we have several key tasks to accomplish : 1 ) to define and quantify the vehicle crowdedness of an area ; 2 ) to picture the crowdedness distribution of the city and identify the hot spots ; and 3 ) to investigate the evolution of hot spots .
Given the dynamic temporal and spatial information of moving vehicles , hot spots can be considered as a general case of object clustering in mobile environments . Clustering for static objects is a well studied topic ( eg , DBSCAN [ 21 ] , BIRCH [ 26 ] , R trees , CLARANS [ 10 , 19] ) . Many interesting algorithms have been proposed and exciting achievements have been made . In recent years , web related clustering , evolutionary clustering in low mobility environments and uncertain data streams have also drawn a lot attention ( eg , micro clustering [ 16 , 24 ] , evolutionary clustering [ 6 ] , UMicro [ 2 , 3 , 11] ) . In our application scenarios , however , some new unique features make previous well designed algorithms fail to capture the real clustering property of moving vehicles .
The first major challenge is incomplete information . Existing algorithms ( for static or mobile ) are all density based approaches that use inter node distances as a critical measure . They depend on the location information of target objects to exploit the clustering property . However , in many practical applications , it is unlikely
919 and investigation results show that several top hot spots are quite locality consistent over time , while more hot spots present more locality variations .
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we provides preliminary information . Section 3 is the foundation of vehicle crowdedness , focusing on an appropriate function of spot crowdedness . In Section 4 , we discuss the hot spot issues in more practical environments , including spot characterization , vehicle profiling , and spatial temporal hot spots . Section 5 discusses hot spots and hot regions . We validate the mobility based clustering through field study which is presented in Section 6 . In Section 7 , we give an overview of the related work . At last , we conclude the paper and outline the directions for future work in Section 8 .
2 . PRELIMINARIES
In this section , we first present characteristics of the raw dataset used in our work . Moreover , we introduce road network grid . At last , we present the main observations and design principles of mobility based clustering . 2.1 Raw dataset characteristics
The dataset is originated from the City Traffic Bureau . It contains real traces from 5631 taxis that have been equipped with GPS receivers ( one for each ) . The GPS receivers periodically report their current states to a data center via GPRS links . The reports include the instant speed , the geographic location and the status of occupied or unoccupied ( by guest ) of the taxi . In the remainder of this paper , we use the terms “ sample ” and “ taxi ” interchangeably , as well as the terms “ location ” and “ spot ” if not otherwise stated . The term “ vehicle ” is used to represent the general vehicles including taxi samples , taxis not sampled , buses , and private cars .
The GPS system that we use is installed for civic applications . Due to the low cost of these applications , the data reports mainly have the following limitations . First , the data set is incomplete . Though the dataset contains statistics of over 5631 taxis , it accounts for no more than 0.3 % of the two million vehicles in the city . Moreover , the statistics of samples may not be complete . Notable amount of reports were missing due to weak GPRS signals ( via which taxis are connected to the system ) or limited bandwidth of GPRS wireless channels . The error will be significant if we use this tiny sample to represent the large number of general vehicles . Moreover , all sample objects are taxis which are only one specific type of vehicles . Taxis are highly incentive oriented that have strong preferences on some desired locations . They would like to aggregate on sites of high customer flows , such as business areas , train stations , and traffic reconnections . Such preferences make it a bad option to employ this one type of vehicles as the representative of others .
Second , it is known that the reported GPS data may not be accurate due to blocked GPS signals ( eg , taxis in tunnel or surrounded by high buildings ) . Since GPRS is a paid communication service , it is costly to frequently report their current status information . In the city , taxis are allowed to report their data at an arbitrary time , with a desired 5 second period . In 5 seconds a vehicle can drive 150 meters at 100 kmph speed . Concerning all these factors , the location errors of vehicles are on the order of hundreds of meters . It becomes impractical to apply the traditional density based approaches which are critically relied on the accurate locations .
Third , the data is biased in temporal and spatial spaces . For example , 90 % roads have no data for more than 80 % of the time in a day , and 50 % have no data in 12 continuous hours . To the opposite , 80 % of the reports are collected from 20 % of roads . How to mine meaningful information from the biased samples is another great
Figure 1 : Vehicle crowdedness distribution and instant locations of sample taxis at 14:00PM on 12th Dec . , 2006 to obtain such information from the total population of vehicles . It greatly degrades the effectiveness of density based algorithms . Second , the sample object set is a specific type of vehicles . It has very limited generality to represent general vehicles . Besides these , there are also some practical concerns such as drastic dynamism , and high object mobility .
To deal with these challenges , we propose a novel , non densitybased approach called mobility based clustering . Mobility based clustering is based on a simple observation that usually vehicles are intended to have high mobility ( speed ) . A vehicle of high mobility can largely indicate a low crowdedness and vice versa . By this , the sample vehicles are not simply used as objects but employed as “ sensors ” to perceive the vehicle crowdedness in nearby areas . The main advantages of mobility based clustering are several folds . First , mobility based clustering is less sensitive to the size of the sample object set , though a larger sample set can produce more precise readings of the crowdedness sensing . Second , mobility based clustering does not require accurate location information and thus is robust to the location inaccuracy . Third , mobility based clustering naturally incorporates the mobility of vehicles . It is therefore particularly suitable for high mobility environments .
Because of these advantages , mobility based clustering greatly outperforms existing density based clustering algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy of vehicle density . Figure 1 illustrates the th Dec . , 2006 . vehicle crowdedness in the city at 14:00PM on 12 The crowdedness situations are represented by the color density . The red dots indicate the instant locations of the sample taxis with passengers , and the black dots indicate the instant locations of the sample taxis without passengers . It is clear that the density based clustering using taxis as samples will generate a quite deviated result . Such a deviation , which is mainly due to the inherent limitation of density based approaches , is our main motivation for this work .
In this paper , we make contributions along following aspects . First , we propose a novel mobility based model to quantify the crowdedness of certain areas , fully taking the mobility and object dynamism as an advantage . This is , to the best of our knowledge , the first attempt of non density based object clustering in literature . Second , several key factors , which have the great impact on the accuracy of the vehicle crowdedness measurements , are identified and investigated . Effective techniques to compensate the negative effects have been developed .
Third , we study the hot spots of top vehicle crowdedness values
920 challenge . Motivated by these new challenges , we propose a novel , mobility based clustering method . 2.2 Road network grid
For ease of computation , we discretize the time dimension in the unit of second . The time instance t = 0 is the initial time . The time instances t and t+1 are consecutive time instances . We discretize the physical space by dynamically partition the whole area into a number of rectangle grids . The size of each grid depends on the intensity of the reports at the area , ranging from 10 meters for report rich areas to 90 meters for report scarce areas . We believe this granularity is sufficient for most applications . Each grid is represented by its center location so that all spots in the grid will be treated the same as that of the grid center . A 2 tuple ι = ( x , y ) represents one grid where x is the index of the grid along the longitude and y is that along the latitude .
We especially introduce domain knowledge and establish road network to amend the grids and retrieve much more accurate spot locations . Because the road topology and type will impact the vehicle , not only the speed , but also the drive pattern , hence we study the following problems based on road network grid . 2.3 Observations and design principles
Different from traditional density based approaches , mobilitybased approach is based on two simple observations . The first one is that vehicles prefer high mobility in a sparse region . To the opposite , for security concerns vehicles will drive slowly when the nearby area is crowded . Motivated by it , we employ vehicles as sensors using their instant speed to sense the vehicle crowdedness of vicinity . The second one is that the reported locations can be erroneous , while the reported speeds are usually quite accurate because they are directly obtained from the speedometers installed on taxis . In addition , for safety concerns sudden changes of speeds are rare . Therefore the speed errors coming from the unsynchronized reports are also small .
Roughly speaking , in mobility based clustering we collect statistics of taxi speeds at each spot . The spot crowdedness is then a relative measurement concerning the instant speed , the maximum speed , and the minimum speed . Though a higher crowdedness usually leads to a smaller mobility , a smaller mobility is not always caused by high crowdedness . Besides the spot crowdedness , there are many other factors having similar effects on taxi mobility .
Firstly , one fact is that drivers may have various driving styles and habits . In particular , due to incentive oriented nature , occupied taxis ( by guests ) often have higher speeds than unoccupied taxis which may be looking for guests ( a typical driving behavior in China ) . Profiling these different drivers will help to interpret taxi motility more precisely .
Secondly , mobility of vehicles is environment dependent . Some roads are designed for high speed traffic , while others are mainly for connection purposes . Traffic lights clearly slow down vehicles , which is not due to the high crowdedness of the spots . We should characterize spots so that to reduce these negative effects .
Thirdly , spot crowdedness may have spatial and temporal correlations . Adjacent spots may have strong connections in between . A crowded spot is very likely to be crowded again in the next time stamp . Hot spots may evolve over both time and spatial dimensions . To well capture the crowdedness of spots , we should take all these factors into account so that the derived crowdedness values can adequately reflect the real crowdedness of spots .
3 . SPOT CROWDEDNESS FUNDAMENTAL In this section , we give an overview of the spot crowdedness .

We first present the assumptions and notations we will use in this paper , and then give two crowdedness functions which can be used to measure the crowdedness of a spot . 3.1 Assumptions and notations
Intuitively , the crowdedness of a spot reflects how crowded a spot is . It becomes difficult when the distribution of the vehicle set is unknown . In order to quantify the crowdedness of unknown object set at a spot , we propose a mobility based model . We assume a set N of vehicles deployed in a two dimensional city plane A . Among these N vehicles , a small subset Ns ⊆ N , |Ns| fi |N| , is the sensor set that we have the completed knowledge . We , however , have no knowledge of the rest part N\Ns . Our task is to use reports of Ns to infer the status of objects in the remainder part N\Ns , especially their spatial properties .
Assume the city A is a given area . Sensory objects in Ns move arbitrarily . Their mobility provides a means of sensing the crowded conditions of vicinity of A unintentionally . These sensors are supposed to report their current states periodically in every five seconds in an asynchronous manner . The report is in a form of 6tuple φ = ( m , x , y , v , β , t ) where m ∈ Nsis an object identifier to uniquely identify the sensor associated with the report , ( x , y ) ∈ A is m ’s current location , v represents m ’s instant speed , β is a binary value to indicate whether m is occupied by guest or not , and t is the reporting time . It is also written as φ(t ) m ) if there is no confusion . As the reports are sent back every five seconds , every second we will have the reports from one fifth of the sensors in average . These reports are called sensing reports . To increase the granularity of our sample dataset , besides these real sensing reports we estimate the states of vehicles during the nonreporting time by applying a linear interpolation method . m = ( x(t ) m , β(t ) m , v(t ) m , y(t )
More specifically , two sensing reports of a sensor are said to be consecutive if there is no sensing report in between along the time dimension . Given two consecutive sensing report φ(t1 ) m and φ(t2 ) m , m at time instant t ∈ [ t1 , t2 ] t2 ≥ t1 , an interpolation report φ(t ) m − x(t1 ) can be calculated by x(t ) m . Those for other variables y(t ) m = β(t1 ) m . Such reports generated by applying interpolation method are called interpolation report . In this work we do not differentiate the sensing report and interpolation report , using both as input for our study m are similar . We assume β(t ) t−t1 t2−t1 ( x(t2 ) m = m , v(t ) m ) + x(t1 )

Figure 4 : Frequency of a spot speed distribution derived by FT and simply call them reports . We denote the set of all reports as m |∀t ∈ [ 0 , +∞ ) , ∀m ∈ Ns} . Note that interpolation Φ = {φ(t ) report is an estimation of the vehicle ’s mobility and therefore may introduce errors . These errors will finally propagate to the measurement and prediction of the crowdedness . Better estimation schemes are left for future work .
Table 1 lists some of the notations used in this work . In the next we define the crowdedness functions which are used to quantify the degree of spot crowdedness . 3.2 A simple linear crowdedness function
A simple way to quantify the crowdedness of a spot is applying a linear function of the instant speed , the maximal and minimal speeds of the spot .
DEFINITION 1 . Given a physical location ι =(x,y ) and the reΦ ( ι ) is the set of all the reported port set Φ , the speed spectrum V ( t ) speeds ( of vehicles ) at time t in location ι in Φ , ie ,
Φ ( ι ) = {v|∃φ(t ) V ( t ) m ∈ Φ , ( x(t ) m , y(t ) m , v(t ) m ) = ( x , y , v)}
The speed spectrum at all time instances is also written as VΦ(ι ) = Φ ( ι ) . Since the time is discrete , Φ contains a finite
∪t∈[0,+∞ ] V ( t ) number of reports and thus the speed spectrum is finite as well .
DEFINITION 2 . The spot speed v(t ) of the speed spectrum in location ι at t ,
Φ ( ι ) is defined as the average
. v(t ) Φ ( ι ) =
1 |V ( t )
Φ ( ι)| vm∈V ( t )
Φ ( ι ) vm
DEFINITION 3 . The linear crowdedness H
( t ) L ( ι ) of a given spot ι is defined as an exponential moving average of the complementary relative ratio of the instant speed over the speed spectrum , vmax(ι)−v(t ) Φ ( ι ) vmax(ι)−vmin(ι )

( ι ) + ( 1 − αι )

( t ) where vmax(ι ) and vmin(ι ) are maximal and minimal speeds of ι , and αι and τι are two parameters to capture the dynamism of ι .
3.3 A statistical crowdedness function
The linear crowdedness function H
( t ) L ( x , y ) is based on an implicit assumption that speeds of vehicles are uniformly distributed in the speed spectrum , which is not necessarily accurate in practice . Figure 2 depicts the speed spectrum of four different spots on 18th Dec . , 2006 . It is a cumulated distribution function ( CDF ) of speeds . Apparently the distributions are not uniform and different spots present various distributions . For Spot 3 , though the maximal speed is as large as 120 kmph , over 80 % of speeds are no more than 25 kmph . In order to well capture the effect of this un uniform speed distribution on the crowdedness measurement , we propose a statistical crowdedness function .
DEFINITION 4 . The statistical crowdedness H
( t ) S ( ι ) of a given spot ι = ( x , y ) is defined as an exponential moving average of the complementary cumulative distribution function ( CCDF ) of the instant speed over the speed spectrum , ie ,

Φ ( ι) ) )
The statistical model is a more general form as the linear model can be considered as a special case with a linear CDF . To calcu(t ) S ( ι ) , we maintain the spot history information for six late the H months . As the computation is carried out at a data center in a centralized manner , the computational and storage cost is acceptable . We validate the two models in Section 6.1 , and conclude that the statistical crowdedness function produces a much better fit crowdedness distribution . Accordingly , in later of this paper we will use the statistical crowdedness function to measure the spot crowdedness . In the following section , we study the methods to improve the statistical model to investigate the mobility .
4 . SPOT CROWDEDNESS IN PRACTICE
In practice , many other factors influence the mobility of nearby vehicles , making mobility based model fail to accurately capture the spot crowdedness property . In this section , we investigate the significance of these factors and present techniques to compensate these effects . 4.1 Characterizing spots
Apparently the vehicle mobility is highly environmental dependent . The mobility ( of vehicles ) at different spots is not necessary to be identical . In this subsection , we unveil the various characteristics of the spot mobility , focusing our major attentions on the system parameters αι and τι which are used to capture the distinctive property of the spot crowdedness .
The parameter αι is a smoothing factor of exponential moving average in Hs . It is used to capture the degree of dynamism of the spot mobility . In general , a smaller αι indicates a higher dynamism and vice versa . The parameter τι is the interval between

Figure 5 : The mean speed grouped by taxis IDs at four different spots
Figure 6 : The difference between the occupied and unoccupied taxis
Figure 7 : Correlation coefficients of spot crowdedness for all spots two moving averages . It reflects the periodic property of the spot crowdedness .
In Section 6.1 we set parameters as αι = 0.5 and τι = 1 for validation convenience . This setting may not be adequate in practice . Indeed , different spots will present distinctive mobility behaviors , resulting in various settings . As shown in Figure 2 , Spot 1 presents a speed spectrum of nearly a step function . Spot 2 and Spot 3 are similar that the major portion of 60 % of speeds are around 20 kmph . Spot 4 has a mimic trend of Spot 2 but the major part is around 40 kmph . Figure 3 gives a more detailed outlook of speed distribution of Spot 1 over one day on 16th Dec . , 2006 . We hope to extract useful information from this deviated speed series and bring insight into the dynamism of the vehicle mobility in the location .
In order to systematically study the speed distribution , we apply Fourier Transformation ( FT ) . FT can transform the function from time domain to frequency domain , revealing inherent periodic property of original function as well as the amplitude of the corresponding frequency . Specifically , given the speed distribution function over time v(t )
( ι ) at a spot ι , its FT can be calculated by , fi +∞
ˆf ( ξ ) =
−∞ v(t )
( l)e−2πitξdt where t is the variable . Figure 4 depicts the FT function ˆf ( ξ ) over the frequency domain of the speed distribution in Figure 3 . We can clearly identify several periods of Spot 1 . Among them , the dominating one is at the frequency of 0.15 ( per minute ) with the amplitude of ˆf ( 0.15 ) = 086 Noticing that in this area the interval between traffic lights are 5 minutes , which is consistent to the period of the second largest amplitude with the frequency of 02 We therefore believe this second period does not reflect the innate periodic property of the spot . As no other periods are comparable to the dominating period in terms of the amplitude , we set the two parameters according to the dominating period given by
' ff
αι = max( ˆf ( ξ ) ) = 0.86 τι = 1 arg maxξ( ˆf ( ξ ) ) = 6.67 minutes
The two derived parameters αι and τι are called dominating average weight and dominating period of the spot . They will be computed and associated with each spot .
The evaluation of this approach is reported in Section 61 The error of the speed predicting is reduced by 14 % . 4.2 Profiling sensor object
Intuitively , vehicle mobility also depends on drivers’ driving styles .
A younger driver may drive more aggressively with higher speeds ,
Ls(t ) while an older driver may be more prudent to drive slowly . In particular , taxis are supremely incentive oriented . They prefer to high mobility with the guest , and deliver the guest as soon as possible , while low mobility when empty to look for a new guest .
The data shows that the reality is , however , not always consistent with these intuitions . Figure 5 depicts the CDF of mean speeds of individual taxis at four different spots . Results of other spots are similar . It shows that though different spots present different mobility , the majority of taxis have a similar behavior at the same spot . Their mean speeds do not differ too much . For instance , at spot NanJing Road , more than 40 % have the mean speed between 20 and 30 kmph , and 30 % are between 30 and 40 kmph , though the mean speed ranges from 0.5 kmph to 100 kmph . At spot YanAn Road , 50 % taxis have the mean speed between 20 and 30 kmph . As other factors have the more influences on the spot mobility , we ignore the impacts of various drivers , assuming that different drivers have the similar behavior at the same spot .
We , however , find that the states of occupied/unoccupied have the more significant impact on the taxi mobility . Figure 6 depicts the differences of mean speeds when taxis are occupied and unoccupied . The CDF of the differences at four different spots are pictured . At NanPu Bridge , 76 % taxis have the differences between 4 and 12 kmph . At YanAn Road , 55 % taxis have the differences between 4 and 11.5 kmph . As the difference is common for each spot , its impact can be hardly ignored . For this we use a simple approach to calibrate the spot mobility according to the state of the reported taxis , whether it is occupied/unoccupied . We use occupied taxis as the base line which are considered as normal . An unoccupied taxi will be calibrated to have more mobility than the reported speed when we compute the spot mobility . The degree of calibration is determined by the spot based on its differences of mean speeds when taxis are occupied and unoccupied . We evaluate this approach in Section 61 5 . HOT SPOTS AND HOT REGIONS
Intuitively the crowdedness of a spot is correlated along the time dimension . In this subsection we investigate hot spots of top crowdedness values . 5.1 Definitions

It is , however , not straightforward to study the temporal property of hot spots directly . One major reason is that hot spots depend on the crowdedness of nearby spots . One hot spot may disappear because of a minor change of the nearby spot crowdedness , and then reappear soon due to the same reason . From the application point of view , these two changes may be too minor to be taken into consideration . To facilitate the investigation on hot spots , we define hot regions and top k hot regions .
DEFINITION 6 . Given the crowdedness distribution H a threshold ζth , the hot regions Rs(t ) the crowdedness value being more than ζth , ie ,
( t ) S ( ι ) and ( ζth ) are the set of spots with
Rs(t )
( ζth ) = {ι|ι ∈ A , H
( t ) s ( ι ) ≥ ζth} .
Apparently there is a one on one mapping between a threshold ζth and a hot region . Given ζth , the derived hot region can be continuous or the union of a set of disjointed sub regions , depending ( t ) S ( ι ) and ζth . Each sub region contains at least one hot spot , on H though not all hot spots are necessary to be contained in hot regions . We are interested in the top hot spots ( eg , top 10 hot spots ) and the hot regions containing these hot spots .
DEFINITION 7 . Top k hot region Rs(t ) k is the hot region with
ζth set as the k th largest spot crowdedness of all hot spots , ie ,
Rs(t ) k = {Rs(t )
( ζth)}
ζth is the k th largest crowdedness in Ls(t )
THEOREM 1 . Rs(t ) k is the smallest ( in area ) hot region that contains the top k hot spots in the area .
We omit the proof due to the space limitation .

A higher correlation indicates more consistency and the upper limit of the correlation is one which happens only when the two time series are linearly dependent .
For each spot , we compute correlation coefficients between its crowdedness of a day and that of the day before . We make the computation for statistics over one month and compute the mean correlation coefficient for each spot . The CDF of mean of correlation coefficients are plotted in Figure 7 . There are mainly three types of spots . About 15 % spots have low temporal correlation around 02 About 45 % spots have middle correlation ranging from 0.4 to 05 And the other 40 % spots presents high temporal properties with coefficients around 0.8 , indicating clear self similarity of spot crowdedness over days . For this third type of spots , we can leverage this high temporal correlation to infer unexpected events . As a case study , Figure 8 pictures the spot crowdedness as a function of time at Jiangwan Stadium on 22nd and 23rd Dec . , 2006 . Their differences over the time are also plotted . We can find that in most the time the two crowdedness curves are very similar . Dramatic deviation appears from 18:00PM , implying some unexpected events happened . Actually , there was a big show then and audiences were trying to aggregate in the stadium .
5.3 Evolutionary hot regions
Let A(Rs ) denote area of a hot region . We quantify spatial correlations of hot regions by area difference ratio θ . Given two hot regions Rs1 and Rs2 , their area difference ratio is calculated by
θRs1,Rs2 = 1 − A(Rs1 ∩ Rs2 ) A(Rs1 ∪ Rs2 )
. k
Figure 9 depicts area difference ratio between Rs(t )
A small ratio indicates more spatial correlations and a large ratio implies more spatial drift of the region . k and Rs(t−1 ) over one day with varying k=2 , 4 , 10 , 20 . We can find that the top2 hot region , which mainly characterizes the top 1 hot spot , does not vary dramatically over the whole day . The maximal difference is no more than 1 % which happens during noon from 12:00PM to 18:00PM . The top 4 hot region presents more variations during the day time . The difference begins to arise at the morning peak time , maintains stable during working hours , and drops quickly during the afternoon peak time . This is similar for top 10 and top 20 hot region but having even earlier arising time and later dropping time . These results reveal that the single top hot spot is fairly stable , while

Figure 11 : Workflow of the crowdedness function verification the several top hot spots have much larger dynamism . For top 20 hot spots , there spatial drifts are up to 80 % over a day .
In order to study the vehicle crowdedness in a region , we define region crowdedness as the average of spot crowdedness over all spots in the region . It is calculated by
.
( t ) s ( Rs ) =
H
( t ) s ( ι )
ι∈Rs H |Rs|
Given two regions Rs1 and Rs2 , their crowdedness difference ratio is defined as
ϑRs1,Rs2 =

H
( t ) s ( Rs2 ) and Rs(t−1 ) k
Figure 10 depicts ϑ between Rs(t ) over one day with varying k=2 , 4 , 20 . As expected , after the morning traffic peak time , the crowdedness increases sharply . For k=2 , the crowdedness increases by more than 60 % in three hours , maintains stable during the working hour , while drops even sharply from 21:00PM to 24:00PM . Other spots present a similar trend of changing . k
6 . FIELD STUDY EVALUATION
In this section , first we evaluate the crowdedness function by the real life datasets ( taxi data and bus data ) , and second , to verify the effectiveness of our mobility based clustering , we compare it with the current method on a number of field studies ( field camera records ) and empirical datasets . 6.1 Crowdedness function validation
Our task of validation is to evaluate which of the linear and statistical crowdedness functions produces a better fit crowdedness distribution . We carry out the validation through two approaches . One is by conducting the prediction about vehicle speed . By this we look for an optimal configuration for mobility based clustering . The second validation is to compare the optimal setting mobilitybased clustering with traditional algorithms through field studies .
Figure 11 illustrates basic procedures of the first part of the validation . In this validation we randomly split the original dataset into two subsets based on vehicle IDs . One sub dataset is used as the input set ( sensing report set ) , and the other one is used as the ) . We ensure that input set and test set are test set ( denoted as Φ disjoint .
We apply the two crowdedness functions on the input set to compute the crowdedness distributions . The parameter αι is set as 0.5 , and τι is set to 1 for validation convenience . The impacts of these two parameters are investigated in Section 41 With the crowdedness distribution available , we design a simple mobility prediction ( t ) L ( ι ) , the vehialgorithm . Given the crowdedness measurement H c

That of H where ( H c are used to be the representatives similar . Taxis in the test set Φ of the general vehicles . We evaluate the effectiveness of the derived crowdedness distribution by investigating the error between the predicted speeds and the real speeds , denoted as ε . We measure the Mean Absolute Difference ( MAD ) which is given by
.
M AD(ε ) = 1 N

Φc ( ι)∈V ( t )

ε .
Figure 12 depicts M AD(ε ) with varying sample object sizes Ns = 250 to 2750 . From this figure we can observe that the linear model HL is sensitive to the sample object size . The setting of 250 sample objects ( Ns = 250 ) produces a mean of error up to 28 kmph . Noticing that the average speed in the downtown area is around 30 kmph ( due to space limitation , this is a relative error over 90 % . As Ns increases , the accuracy of the linear model is sharply improved . The setting of Ns = 1200 has the mean(ε ) around 19 kmph with a relative error about 80 % . There are , however , no obvious further improvements when Ns continues to increase . Compared with the linear model , the statistical model is much more robust to the size of the sample set . The mean(ε)is 21 kmph , 23 % better than that of linear model when Ns = 250 . The error keeps decreasing when the sample set increases . When Ns = 2750 , the error mean is only 15 kmph , which is 50 % as the relative error .
To test the robustness , we validate the crowdedness functions using not only the traces of taxis , but also traces of 3108 public buses . It is notable that the bus traces are limited to fixed routes . Buses are a specific type of vehicle with more particular moving patterns . They have regular service routes , periodic moving schedules , and fixed stops . Hence , they are not good enough to help detect hot spots . But they are capable of validating our method . We apply the statistical crowdedness function on both taxi and bus traces , deriving two crowdedness distributions . Results show that these two distributions are fairly consistent . The consistency is measured by correlation coefficient as defined in Section 5 . A higher correlation indicates more consistency and the upper limit of the correlation is one which happens only when the two time series are linearly dependent . We find that the average correlation coefficient is up to 63 % . Over 70 % spots have the correlation coefficient ρ between 0.6 and 0.8 , and about 10 % are more than 08 We also notice that about 20 % spots have very low ρ in between . It is mainly because most of these spots are bus stops and traffic reconnection sites . In these areas bus speeds are mainly determined by the site type and thus provide little information for spot crowdedness .
In Section 4 , we study spot crowdedness in practice . As a consequence , we find two approaches to reduce the error of speed predicting . The first one is to characterize spots , and the second one is to profile sensor objects . In Figure 13 , we report the evaluation of the first approach , and then we evaluate the impact from the characteristics of sensor objects .
Figure 13 plots MAD of HSwith the simple parameter setting αι = 0.5 , τι = 1 and with the advanced settings of dominating average weight and dominating period . We observe that with the improved setting , the error can be further reduced by 10 % when Ns = 600 , and by 14 % when Ns = 2400 . We conclude that the improved setting is more advantaged under low sample set scenarios , while the advantages are largely revoked by the larger sample set . With the state calibration by profiling the sensor objects , the prediction error is further reduced by about 16 % when Ns > 1200 .

6.2 Mobility based clustering validation
In order to verify the effectiveness of our mobility based clustering , we conduct a number of field studies . We setup video cameras at predetermined sites in the city , record the real traffic situations in fields , and then measure the crowdedness of these areas through an off line manner . The results are denoted as “ real situation ” .
On selecting comparison methods , we choose UMicro , one of the latest representative method for clustering uncertain data streams [ 2 ] . For UMicro , we assume each taxi in the sample set represents 80,000 general vehicles , because our dataset has records of 5631 taxis , accounting 0.3 % of the two million of the total vehicle population in the city . For mobility based clustering , the produced crowdedness is a relative value . It needs an appropriate scalar to generate the absolute vehicle densities . To obtain this scalar , we need to collect the real initial state of the spot for calibration . In practice , this calibration usually incurs relatively high cost . We argue , nevertheless , that this calibration is a single run operation such that the high cost can be amortized over a long operation time .
Figure 14 depicts the real vehicle crowdedness , the estimated number by mobility based clustering , and that by UMicro at the spot of Jiangsu Road over two hours on 15th , Jan , 2009 . Recall the definition of correlation coefficient defined in Section 61 It can be used to measure the accuracy of the derived spot crowdedness . Moreover , we utilize precision , recall and F score to give insight into the accuracy . Precision means the percentage of true hot spots in the detected hot spots . Recall means the percentage of detected true hot spots in true hot spots . F score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall [ 4 ] .
Table 2 lists the comparison between mobility based clustering and UMicro approach ( Appr ) We evaluate the results by correlation coefficient ( Corr. ) , precision ( Pre. ) , recall ( Rec. ) , and F score . The data from three locations ( Loc ) It shows that at Jiangsu Road , the results of mobility based clustering are 10 to 20 times better than UMicro under the same scenario . The interesting thing here is that UMicro performs pretty well at Rail Station . We believe this is because the Rail Station is a taxi aggregated area with high customer flows . Therefore , the samples at this spot are much larger than those at other spots , resulting in a much better accuracy by density based approaches .

In the research work [ 16 ] Li et al . discussed the clustering of moving objects and extended the concept of micro cluster . High quality moving microclusters are dynamically maintained which leads to fast and competitive clustering results . Chakrabarti et al . [ 6 ] proposed evolutionary clustering which is able to well deal with the mobile clusters in low dynamic environments . Chen et al . [ 7 ] proposed a framework D Stream to efficiently identify outliers of clusters . Extensive efforts are also devoted to the clustering with uncertain data [ 9,12,23 ] , data streams [ 14 ] , uncertain data streams [ 2,23,24 ] , complex event processing [ 14 , 23 ] , co clustering on large datasets [ 23 ] , ranking queries [ 11 , 20 , 23 ] , and evolutionary clustering [ 6 , 23 ] .
The above existing works are density based approaches . Especially in their study scenario , they all consider the density or quantity of the objects is enough to cluster . Thus when the density or quantity of the objects is not that good enough for special application scenarios , they will fail . In our application scenario , these methods do not work due to the new arising features , such as extreme less samples and notable data point location errors .
Traffic data analysis : Another category of related work focuses on the analysis of mobile traffic object data . They are mainly interested in the detecting areas of high traffic load . For instance , Gaffney et al . [ 8 ] studied the problem of clustering trajectories and proposed to use short data sequences as object movements . Liu et al . [ 17 ] studied the trajectory patterns for activity monitoring . Li et al . [ 15 ] studied traffic flow patterns in road networks and proposed a density based algorithm called FlowScan . Kriegel et al . [ 13 ] introduced a statistical approach to describe the likelihood of any given individual in road networks to be located at a certain position and time . These works mainly focused on how to accurately measure and predict vehicle speeds while showing very limited insight into mobile vehicle clustering . Other proposals suggested to use dedicated sensors deployed on roads to perceive vehicle crowdedness . Coifman [ 5 ] studied how to detect freeway inci
926 dents by traffic detectors on roads . Some utilize vehicles equipped with GPS and/or a cellular positioning system as probes . Hollmén et al . [ 22 ] studied spatio temporal road condition forecasting by Markov chains and artificial neural networks . Mo et al . [ 18 ] proposed the sustainable sensing in the forest . Yoon et al . [ 25 ] tried to detect traffic conditions on surface streets given location traces collected from on road vehicles , such as GPS location data , and infrequent low bandwidth cellular updates .
The current work assumed that the dedicated sensor devices had been deployed so that the collection of vehicle crowdedness becomes straightforward . In our work , we do not have dedicated sensors but employ mobile objects as “ sensors ” to perceive the crowdedness .
8 . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper , we proposed mobility based clustering , a novel approach to identify hot spots and hot regions in a highly mobile environment with extremely limited and biased samples . The unique feature of mobility based clustering is to use the speed information to infer the crowdedness of moving objects . We evaluated the performance of mobility based clustering based on real taxi data collected in the city through field studies . With 0.3 % sample object set the mobility based clustering can measure the spot crowdedness with an accuracy of 61.3 % at a certain site , compared with that of 3.3 % under the same scenario by the traditional density based approach UMicro . We also studied spatial and temporal properties of hot spots and hot regions .
The future work can be conducted along following directions . First , in mobility based clustering the speed information is critical . Due to the small sample dataset , we used a simple approach to estimate the mobility of vehicles at the spot of no data . Better mobility estimation can produce better crowdedness values . Second , there are many factors besides the spot crowdedness that will have impact on the vehicle mobility , such as traffic lights and car accidents . We leave them for future work . Third , we need more field studies , though labor intensive , to further verify the effectiveness of the mobility based approach . Forth , the better road network griding method is needed for retrieving much more precious locations . Finally , our proposed mobility based clustering is one approach to cluster mobile objects . Depending on other characteristics of moving objects , other non density based clustering may be worth further investigations .
