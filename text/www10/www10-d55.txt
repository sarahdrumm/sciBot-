ABSTRACT With the growing amount of information on users’ desktops and increasing scale and complexity of intranets , Enterprise and Desktop Search are becoming two increasingly important Information Retrieval applications . While the challenges arising there are not completely different from those that the web community has faced for years , advanced web search solutions are often unable to address them properly . In this tutorial we give a research prospective on distinctive features of both Enterprise and Desktop Search , explain typical search scenarios , and review existing ranking techniques and algorithms .

1 . ENTERPRIZE SEARCH
In [ 14 ] it is estimated that Enterprise Search industry is growing at 20 % per year , and is expected to reach 2.55B by 2010 . Despite its increasing practical importance , until now Enterprise Search has received relatively little attention from the web research community . Distinctive features of Enterprise Search stem from the fact that the social forces driving creation of content on the Web are different from those in the Enterprise . For example , analysis of the structure of the Enterprise Web [ 15 ] indicates that it is quite different from the well known bow tie structure of the public Web and PageRank is not as effective in the Enterprise Search setting . This and other differences result in unique challenges for crawling , indexing , and ranking components of a search engine . While the difficulty of Enterprise Search is a well acknowledged fact , there are relatively few research papers that attempt to study specific features that work and do not work in this area . In this part of the tutorial we highlight differences between Web and Enterprise Search and summarize existing approaches to deal with the Enterprise specific search problems .

1.1 User Feedback
While there are many problems that make Enterprise Search more difficult than Web Search , there are also some advantages . One such advantage is that there is typically no spam in the Enterprise . In fact , users are often inclined to cooperate with the search engine by providing their feedback and are not so concerned about privacy . Due to more manageable scale of the data , it is also much easier to utilize such feedback in the Enterprise setting than in the Web setting . This part of the tutorial is devoted to search algorithms which utilize explicit and implicit user annotations [ 10 , 6 ] , user browsing traces [ 4 ] , query session analysis and eye tracking [ 5 ] . 1.2 Exploratory Search
Since the quality of Enterprise Search is rather limited [ 22 ] , exploratory and interactive user interfaces are necessary to acquire more feedback from users and eventually satisfy their information needs . While stressing on the need to summarize the search results to support exploratory search , we demonstrate the most representative approaches to visualize result summaries [ 16 ] and review techniques to stimulate interaction with the user . When explaining the utility of structured metadata for facets discovery , we put a special focus on the need to avoid information overload and present various methods for facet ranking and selection [ 24 , 3 ] . Further , we describe methods to transform unstructured metadata ( tags and tag clouds ) into facet/value hierarchies using information extraction techniques and knowledge bases , such as Wordnet or Wikipedia . We also discuss the ways to structure search results and facilitate faceted browsing for documents with no metadata . 1.3 Expert Search
In the Enterprise people often search not only for relevant documents , but also for their colleagues that know something on the topic of their information need [ 17 ] . Expert finding is one of the most rapidly developing sub domains in the Enterprise search world . We demonstrate typical use cases of expert finding problem and existing applications [ 21 ] . We continue with the introduction into the state of the art expert finding techniques : profile based [ 2 ] and document centric [ 1 ] methods . We also show how to take into account the exploratory behavior of the real world search for experts and utilize the expertise evidence coming from indirectly related documents , social contacts [ 26 ] and sources available outside of the Enterprise , such as regional web pages , news and blogs [ 25 ] .

While Enterprise Search spans activities of thousands of users across the intranet , a single user activity mostly occurs on a single desktop . Recent progress in Desktop Search technology allows any knowledge worker to have a personal search engine on top of his/her local documents . In this part of the tutorial we discuss Desktop Search goals and challenges , considering both industrial Desktop Search solutions and research prototypes . We also survey approaches to context detection , their application to ranking and evaluation strategies for Desktop Search . 2.1 Desktop Search in Industry and Academia In this part of the tutorial we review several commercial systems , such as Yahoo , Copernic , Archivarius , Google , and Windows [ 20 ] . Later , we look at the systems that have been developed by researchers in industry and academia to support Personal Information Management . Relevant systems are either centered around tasks [ 11 ] or focused on advanced navigation and search functionality [ 12 , 8 ] . 2.2 User Context
The important feature of Desktop Search is that the user context is readily available . Such context can be represented by location , activity , time , season , emotional state , etc . Modern machine learning methods allow to recognize complex user activities and classify them into high level tasks [ 23 ] . They use signals coming from the user ’s interaction with local files and switches between application windows and web page visits . In this part of the tutorial we show how being informed about the current user activities , a search engine is able to predict which desktop ranking algorithm is the most appropriate for the user at the query time [ 9 ] . We present the evaluation of these systems against industrial solutions and discuss open problems . 2.3 Evaluation
Experimental evaluation is a long standing challenge in
Desktop Search . The traditional Cranfield evaluation methodology , as adopted by TREC , cannot be directly applied to Desktop Search . It is highly complicated by privacy concerns for personal data , idiosyncratic user behavior , different levels of computer literacy , variety of information tasks , and non repeatability of the experiments . In the last part of the tutorial we discuss ideas for Desktop Search evaluation [ 18 , 13 , 7 , 19 ] . We conclude the tutorial with the summary of open questions and promising research directions in Enterprise and Desktop Search .
