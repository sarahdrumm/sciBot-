ABSTRACT
In this paper we study the community structure of endorsement networks , ie , social networks in which a directed edge u → v is asserting an action of support from user u to user v . Examples include scenarios in which a user u is favoring a photo , liking a post , or following the microblog of user v . Starting from the hypothesis that the footprint of a community in an endorsement network is a bipartite directed clique from a set of followers to a set of leaders , we apply frequent itemset mining techniques to discover such bicliques . Our analysis of real networks discovers that an interesting phenomenon is taking place : the leaders of a community are endorsing each other forming a very dense nucleus .

INTRODUCTION
Understanding the viral spread of information in social media , modeling how information propagation relates to the underlying community structure , and identifying influential users , are all related tasks and important challenges with potential high returns . As a step in the direction of understanding information propagation and identifying influential users , in this paper we study the community structure of endorsement networks , ie , networks in which a directed edge u → v is asserting a unit of support from user u to user v . For instance in Flickr , a user u may comment or favor a photo of another user v . It might also be the case that u admires v ’s photos and wants to be updated on v ’s future posts : in this case u may add v as a contact . Indeed in Flickr contacts are unilateral , not necessarily symmetric , and they represent endorsement , not friendship . On the other hand , when a user u declares another user v as friend or family , the reason is that u wants to share her photos with v , and therefore this link represents social affinity rather than endorsement . As another example , in microblogging services such as Twitter , users post short messages which are displayed on their profile page and delivered to the author ’s subscribers who are known as followers . Being a follower is an explicit form of endorsement . In some cases a user

Analyzing endorsement networks and understanding their community structure , can lead to deeper insights in the leaders followers relationship , and ultimately , to mastering how information and user generated content is propagating . The applications are various , ranging from marketing and surveying , to politics and campaigning .
We start from the hypothesis that the footprint of a community in a social endorsement network is a biclique from a set of followers to a set of leaders . Recall that , for a bipartite subgraph formed by node sets A and B to be a biclique , every possible link from nodes in A to nodes in B must be present . Trough our analysis of real world endorsement networks we achieve two important insights .
Large cores : endorsement networks contain large bi cliques from a set of followers to a set of leaders .
Very dense nuclei : the set of leaders ( nucleus ) of a core almost always exhibits an extremely high internal density .
2 . CORES , NUCLEI AND THEIR DENSITY We denote the endorsement network by G = ( V , E ) , where V is a set of nodes and E is a set of directed edges . A directed edge ( u , v ) ∈ E indicates an action of endorsement from node u to node v . A core C = ( L , F ) of the network G consists of two disjoint subsets of V , ie , L , F ⊆ V with L ∩ F = ∅ , so that for each u ∈ F and v ∈ L it is ( u , v ) ∈ E . The set L represents the leaders of the core , and set F represents the followers of the core . The set of leaders L is also called the nucleus of the core . Given a core C = ( L , F ) , we define the size of the core s(C ) to be the size of the leader set L , ie , s(C ) = |L| , and the support of the core σ(C ) to be the size of the follower set F , ie , σ(C ) = |F | .
Given an endorsement network G , a threshold value s0 on core size , and a threshold value σ0 on core support , we seek to find all cores C in G that have size s(C ) ≥ s0 and support σ(C ) ≥ σ0 . It is almost immediate that this is an instance of frequent itemset mining [ 1 ] . Among the various strategies to deal with the patterns explosion problem , an interesting one is to consider only maximal frequent itemsets [ 2 ] . A maximal frequent itemset is simply an itemset which is frequent and has no frequent superset . In our context this means that given σ0 we are not interested in a core where the nucleus of leaders is X , if the nucleus X ∪{v} has still enough followers . The benefit of extracting only the maximal nuclei is twofold : ( i ) fewer and more interesting cores , and ( ii ) more efficient computation .
Given a core C = ( L , F ) , we define the leader leader density of the core δLL(C ) to be the internal density of the leader set L , that is the fraction of the number of all edges between

Table 2 : For various values of s0 and σ0 : numbers of cores found ( column 3 ) ; total number of nodes which are follower ( respectively , leader ) in at least one core , ie , F = {v | ∃C = ( F , L ) ∧ v ∈ F } , and L = {v | ∃C = ( F , L ) ∧ v ∈ L} ; number of nodes that are leader in one core and follower in another one ; average leader leader and follower follower density . user v as favorite or if s/he has made at least one comment in a photo of v . Our second endorsement network is Jaiku ( Jaiku ) , a micro blogging social network . Here we have a directed edge from user u to user v whenever user u is following user v . The Flickr social network ( Flickr S ) , use the same sample of users as in the case of Flickr E , but in this case a directed edge from users u to user v indicates that user u has marked user v to be their “ friend ” or “ family ” . The second social network we use is Yahoo! 360 ( Y!360 ) , an undirected network that indicates friendship relationship among users . This is the unique undirected network we use , but we can make it directed by considering for each edge the two links in both directions . The basic characteristics and statistics of our datasets are reported in Table 1 . Notice that the Jaiku network is significantly smaller than the other three , on the other hand , the Y!360 network is the sparsest of all . Note that although the networks Flickr E and Flickr S are defined over the same base of users , they have different number of nodes due to the removal of singleton nodes .
We next report the empirical evidence of our findings , namely that large cores can be found in endorsement networks and that these cores have a very dense leadership nucleus . Indeed , our results ( reported in Table 2 ) clearly show that δLL is usually very large for endorsement networks , while it is always smaller for friendship based social networks . In both endorsement and social networks , the average density of links among the followers ( ie , δFF ) is always much lower than the nucleus density ( ie , δLL ) . This clearly shows the presence of a strong directionality of the links : mainly from the followers to the leaders . Recall that δFL(C ) = 1 by definition , or in other terms , in a core all followers point to all leaders . It is worth mentioning that we can not use the same settings of the parameters s0 and σ0 in all the networks , as they have different sizes and different densities : what is a reasonable settings for one network could result in too few cores in another network .
Using the method of swap randomization we confirm that the structure of the cores that we report in this paper is statistical significant .
Finally , as it is usually the case when mining any form of frequent patterns , our method produces many similar , overlapping , redundant cores , which presumably are different footprints of the same community . This indicates the need to devise clustering technique in order to coalesce similar cores into meaningful communities , having a very large followers base , while still maintaining a very high density in their leadership nucleus .

Similarly we define the follower follower density δFF(C ) to be the internal density of the follower set F .
