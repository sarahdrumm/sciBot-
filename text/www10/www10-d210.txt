ABSTRACT When a Web user ’s underlying information need is not clearly specified from the initial query , an effective approach is to diversify the results retrieved for this query . In this paper , we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for Web search result diversification , which explicitly accounts for the various aspects associated to an underspecified query . In particular , we diversify a document ranking by estimating how well a given document satisfies each uncovered aspect and the extent to which different aspects are satisfied by the ranking as a whole . We thoroughly evaluate our framework in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web track . Moreover , we exploit query reformulations provided by three major Web search engines ( WSEs ) as a means to uncover different query aspects . The results attest the effectiveness of our framework when compared to state of the art diversification approaches in the literature . Additionally , by simulating an upper bound query reformulation mechanism from official TREC data , we draw useful insights regarding the effectiveness of the query reformulations generated by the different WSEs in promoting diversity .

INTRODUCTION
As inherently underspecified representations of more complex information needs , queries submitted to a Web search engine are often ambiguous [ 29 ] . Such ambiguity is manifested in different ways . For instance , a query may not express a clearly defined sense ( eg , ‘java’ ) , or it can represent a genuine need for a broader coverage of a clearly defined sense ( eg , ‘java programming language’ ) . In the first case , the query is open to different interpretations ( eg , programming language , coffee , island ) , whereas in the second case , Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee ( IW3C2 ) . Distribution of these papers is limited to classroom use , and personal use by others . WWW 2010 , April 26–30 , 2010 , Raleigh , North Carolina , USA . ACM 978 1 60558 799 8/10/04 . the user might be interested in different aspects underlying the query ( eg , development kit download , courses , books , language specifications , tutorials ) [ 11 ] .
Whatever the level of ambiguity associated to a query , a search engine has to tackle it . The simplest approach could be to completely ignore any sort of ambiguity and treat the query as representing a single , well defined information need . This could result in satisfying the user ’s need only by chance . A different approach could be to infer the most plausible meaning underlying the query ( eg , the most popular ) , and to focus the retrieval process on results satisfying that particular meaning . This , in turn , could represent a risky choice , as a wrong guess could leave the user unsatisfied . Another alternative could be to explicitly ask the user for feedback on the correct meaning underlying the query . This has been one of the approaches taken by many Web search engines , in which a user is presented with different reformulations of the original query . However , one cannot expect that the users will always be willing to tell the search engine what they mean exactly [ 16 ] and , even if they would , their underlying need might still be for multiple aspects related to the specified meaning . In such a scenario , where a ( usually short ) query is the only evidence of the user ’s information need available to the search engine , a more sensible approach is to diversify the results retrieved for this query , in the hope that at least one of them will satisfy the user [ 1 ] . Diversifying search results usually involves a departure from the independent document relevance assumption underlying the well known probability ranking principle in information retrieval ( IR ) [ 12 , 24 ] . it is arguable whether users will still find a given document relevant to their information need once other documents already satisfying this need have been observed . Therefore , a search engine should consider not only the relevance of each individual document , but also how relevant the document is in light of the other retrieved documents [ 13 ] . By doing so , the retrieved documents should provide the maximum coverage and minimum redundancy with respect to the possible aspects underlying a query [ 10 ] . Ideally , the covered aspects should also reflect their relative importance , as perceived by the user population [ 1 ] . In its general form , this is an NP hard problem [ 1 , 6 ] . Most previous approaches to this problem are based on a greedy approximation algorithm , inspired by the notion of maximal marginal relevance [ 5 ] . In common , they seek to promote diversity by directly comparing the documents retrieved for a given query to one another , in order to iteratively select those that are the most relevant to the query while being the most dissimilar to the
Indeed , documents already selected . Therefore , these approaches implicitly assume that similar documents will cover similar interpretations or aspects underlying the query , and should hence be demoted , in order to achieve a diversified ranking . Alternatively , the broad topic underlying an ambiguous or underspecified query can be usually decomposed into its constituent sub topics . Hence , we can explicitly account for different aspects of the query , in order to produce a diverse ranking of results . In this paper , we introduce a novel framework for search result diversification that exploits this intuition . In particular , our framework uncovers different aspects underlying the original query in the form of subqueries , and estimates the relevance of the retrieved documents to each identified sub query . As a consequence , we can take into account both the variety of aspects covered by a single document , as well as its novelty in face of the aspects already covered by other retrieved documents . Moreover , the relative importance of each identified sub query can be directly incorporated within our framework , so as to bias the diversification process towards more plausible aspects of the initial query . In a thorough experimentation , we evaluate the effectiveness of our framework using a large Web test collection , in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web track [ 9 ] . In addition , to demonstrate its applicability in a real setting , we investigate two different strategies for sub query generation , based on query reformulations provided by three major Web search engines . The results attest the effectiveness of our framework when compared to current state of the art diversification approaches .
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows . Section 2 overviews related work on search result diversification . Section 3 further details our main contributions . Section 4 introduces our proposed framework for the diversification problem , its probabilistic derivation and the estimation of its components . Sections 5 and 6 describe the experimental setup and the evaluation of our proposed framework , respectively , in the context of the TREC 2009 Web track . Lastly , Section 7 presents our concluding remarks .
2 . RELATED WORK
Search result diversification can be characterised as a bicriterion optimisation problem , in which one seeks to maximise the overall relevance of a document ranking to multiple query aspects , while minimising its redundancy with respect to these aspects [ 14 ] . In its general form , this problem is an instance of the maximum coverage problem [ 18 ] , which makes it NP hard . Indeed , if we consider a query q as comprising a set of aspects A , and each document d from an initial ranking R as comprising a subset of the aspects in A , then the problem is to find a subset S ⊆ R , with |S| ≤ τ , such that | ∪di∈S di| is maximised for a given τ [ 1 ] .
In practice , most previous works on search result diversification are based on a greedy approximation to this problem . Given a ranking R for an ambiguous query , a re ranking S is produced by iteratively selecting a ‘local best’ document from R \ S . This document should provide the maximum coverage of the aspects underlying the initial query , and the minimum redundancy with respect to the aspects covered by the documents already in S ( ie , the documents selected in previous iterations ) . The existing approaches differ mostly in how they account for the different query aspects . In particular , these approaches can be categorised as either implicit or explicit [ 27 ] . Implicit approaches assume that sim ilar documents will cover similar aspects , and should hence be demoted in the final ranking , so as to reduce its overall redundancy . In turn , explicit approaches directly model the query aspects , actively seeking to maximise the coverage of their selected documents with respect to these aspects .
Among the implicit diversification approaches in the literature , the maximal marginal relevance ( MMR ) method of Carbonell and Goldstein [ 5 ] is the canonical example . At each iteration , the MMR method selects a document that has the highest combination of a similarity score with respect to a query and a dissimilarity score with respect to the documents selected at earlier ranks . Subsequent approaches inspired by MMR differ mainly in how the similarity between documents is computed . For instance , whereas Carbonell and Goldstein suggested using any content based similarity function ( eg , cosine ) , Zhai and Lafferty [ 33 ] proposed to model relevance and redundancy within the language modelling framework . In particular , they devised several methods based on the Kullback Leibler divergence measure and a simple mixture model . Chen and Karger [ 8 ] proposed a probabilistic approach to the related problem of retrieving one relevant document for a given query . By assuming that the previously selected documents are not relevant , they achieved an unplanned effect of diversification . More recently , Wang and Zhu [ 30 ] employed the correlation between documents as a measure of their similarity . Their work also showed that , by minimising this correlation , the overall variance of a document ranking is reduced , as well as the associated risk of overestimating its relevance .
Instead of accounting for the aspects covered by each document only implicitly , a promising direction is to explicitly model these aspects within the diversification approach . For instance , Agrawal et al . [ 1 ] investigated the diversification problem by employing a taxonomy for both queries and documents . In their work , two documents retrieved for a query are considered similar if they are confidently classified into one or more common categories covered by the query . Hence , documents classified into many categories are favoured , while those classified into already well represented categories are penalised . Similarly , Carterette and Chandar [ 7 ] proposed a probabilistic model to maximise the coverage of a document ranking with respect to the aspects of a query , represented as topics or relevance models estimated from the top ranked documents . A different approach was investigated by Radlinski and Dumais [ 23 ] . They proposed to filter the ranking produced for a given query , so as to have a more even distribution of documents satisfying each aspect of this query . In particular , they uncovered query aspects from the query log of a commercial search engine .
Our approach also accounts for the aspects of a query in an explicit way . However , differently from the aforementioned approaches , we do not simply filter out documents satisfying an already well satisfied aspect . Moreover , we do not require that these aspects be estimated with respect to a predefined taxonomy , or using the top retrieved documents for the initial query . Instead , by representing the several query aspects as a set of sub queries , we recognise the multiplicity behind an ambiguous query , without making any limiting assumption regarding the generation of these subqueries . Furthermore , by estimating the relevance of each retrieved document to every identified sub query , as well as the importance of each sub query itself , we address the diversification problem in a principled and effective manner .

4 . EXPLICIT QUERY ASPECT
DIVERSIFICATION
The diversification problem can be naturally stated as a tradeoff between finding relevant and novel information :
Given an initial ranking R for a query q , find a re ranking S that has the maximum coverage and the minimum redundancy with respect to the different aspects underlying q .
As discussed in Section 2 , in its general form , this bicriterion optimisation problem can be reduced from the maximum coverage problem [ 18 ] , which makes it NP hard [ 1 ] . Fortunately , there is a well known approximation to this problem [ 5 ] , which works well in practice [ 6 ] , and is at the heart of most of the approaches to search result diversification presented in Section 2 . However , most of these approaches seek to achieve the objective of diversification at the high expense of directly comparing documents to one another . On the other hand , the approaches that somehow explicitly account for the aspects associated to the initial query have their own limitations . For instance , they rely on filtering heuristics [ 23 ] , or on the estimation of query aspects based on a predefined taxonomy [ 1 ] or on the documents retrieved for the initial query [ 7 ] . Instead , in this work , we propose to model the aspects associated to a query in a principled yet practical manner . In particular , we consider an ambiguous query as a compound rather than a single representation of an underlying information need . We then model this query as a set of sub queries , which can be estimated in a variety of ways . In this work , we experiment with sub queries derived from query reformulations provided by major Web search engines , as discussed in Section 422 4.1 The xQuAD Framework
In this section , we introduce xQuAD ( eXplicit Query Aspect Diversification ) , a novel probabilistic framework for search result diversification , which explicitly models an ambiguous query as a set of sub queries . Sub queries associated to an initial query can be effectively uncovered using mechanisms available to most modern Web search engines , eg , query reformulations based on previous user interactions [ 3 ] . Moreover , probability theory provides xQuAD with an appropriate groundwork for handling the uncertainty incurred by the underspecification of information needs as queries . In particular , we derive our framework in light of the aforementioned approximation of the general diversification problem , as described in Section 2 . The working scheme of xQuAD is described in Algorithm 1 .

Algorithm 1 : The xQuAD framework .
Given an ambiguous query q and an initial ranking R produced for this query , we build a new ranking S by iteratively selecting the τ highest scored documents from R , according to the following probability mixture model : ( 1 − λ ) P(d|q ) + λ P(d , ¯S|q ) ,
( 1 ) where P(d|q ) is the likelihood of document d being observed given the initial query q , and P(d , ¯S|q ) is the likelihood of observing this document but not the documents already in S , which were selected in previous iterations of the algorithm . In particular , these two probabilities can be regarded as modelling relevance and diversity , respectively , with a mixing parameter λ controlling the tradeoff between the two .
In order to derive P(d , ¯S|q ) , we explicitly consider the possibly several aspects underlying the initial query q as a set of sub queries , generated by some mechanism Q , such that Q = {q1 , · · · , qk} . By enforcing Pqi∈Q P(qi|q ) = 1 , we can marginalise P(d , ¯S|q ) across multiple sub queries :
P(d , ¯S|q ) = X qi∈Q
P(qi|q ) P(d , ¯S|qi ) ,
( 2 ) where P(qi|q ) can be seen as a measure of the relative importance of the sub query qi with respect to the other subqueries associated to q . For instance , this probability could reflect the fraction of the user population that is interested in the aspect represented by the sub query qi more so than in other aspects of q . Next , assuming that the observation of the document d is independent of the documents already in S for a given sub query qi ( since the documents in S are fixed at a given iteration ) , we break down P(d , ¯S|qi ) as :
P(d , ¯S|qi ) = P(d|qi ) P( ¯S|qi ) ,
( 3 ) where P(d|qi ) is a measure of the coverage of document d with respect to the sub query qi . In turn , P( ¯S|qi ) provides a measure of novelty , as the probability of qi not being satisfied by any of the documents already selected in S .
The independence assumption in Equation ( 3 ) has a subtle but important implication : it turns the computation of novelty from a direct comparison between documents into an estimation of the marginal utility of the sub queries satisfied by a document . In other words , instead of comparing a document d to all documents already selected in S , as implicit diversification approaches would do , we estimate the utility of any document satisfying the sub query qi , given how well it is already satisfied by the documents in S . Although we achieve the same objective of promoting novelty , we do so in a much more efficient way . In particular , our approach does not require looking up the terms contained in all documents from the initial ranking R , so as to enable their direct comparison . Instead , we just update the novelty estimation of a given sub query , based on the estimated relevance of each document in S to this sub query . In contrast to implicit approaches , this only incurs a few additional inverted file lookups for the documents matching the sub query terms .
In order to derive P( ¯S|qi ) , we further assume that the relevance of a document dj in S to a given sub query qi is independent of the relevance of other documents in S to the same sub query . Since our goal is to estimate the likelihood of the ranking S ( as an entire set of documents ) not satisfying the sub query qi , this constitutes a plausible assumption . Under this assumption , we have :
P( ¯S|qi ) = P(d1 , · · · , dn−1|qi )
= Y dj ∈S
( 1 − P(dj|qi) ) .
( 4 )
Finally , by replacing Equations ( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) into Equa tion ( 1 ) , we have the final score computed by xQuAD :
( 1 − λ ) P(d|q ) + λ X hP(qi|q ) P(d|qi ) Y qi∈Q dj ∈S
( 1 − P(dj|qi))i .

4.2 Components Estimation
Within the xQuAD framework , several dimensions of the diversification problem are naturally modelled as individual probabilities . In practice , we estimate each of these probabilities as a separate component of the framework . Along with the sub query generation mechanism , these components can be summarised as follows :
1 . document relevance , P(d|q ) ,
2 . document diversity , P(d , ¯S|q ) :
( a ) sub query generation , Q ,
( b ) sub query importance , P(qi|q ) , ( c ) document coverage , Pqi∈Q P(d|qi ) , ( d ) document novelty , Pqi∈Q| P(d|qi)>0 P( ¯S|qi ) .
In the remainder of this section , we propose suitable alternatives for estimating these components . In Section 6 , the impact of each of these components on the diversification performance of xQuAD is thoroughly investigated .
421 Document Relevance , Coverage , and Novelty The document relevance , coverage , and novelty components of the xQuAD framework are based on estimations of relevance . In particular , the document relevance component estimates the relevance of a document to the initial query , while the coverage and novelty components are based on relevance estimations with respect to sub queries . In practice , any probabilistic retrieval approach can be used to produce these estimations , eg , language modelling [ 17 ] . Moreover , different approaches can be deployed to produce the relevance estimation for each individual component .
In Section 6 , we experiment with three effective document weighting models , from different families of probabilistic models , in order to estimate these components . In practice , we produce a document ranking for both the initial query , as well as each of the generated sub queries . For the sake of clarity , a ranking produced for the initial query is denoted a baseline ranking , while those generated for subqueries are denoted sub rankings .
422 Sub Query Generation
Sub queries play a fundamental role within our proposed diversification framework . Indeed , the introduction of this component allows us to depart from the usually inefficient approach of directly comparing the retrieved documents to one another . More importantly , we diverge from the implicit assumption that similar documents will cover similar aspects underlying a query . Instead , by explicitly modelling these aspects in the form of sub queries , we claim that a more effective search result diversification can be attained .
Several techniques can be used for generating keywordbased representations of query aspects in the form of subqueries . For instance , using the target document collection itself , one could apply traditional query expansion techniques [ 26 ] in order to generate ‘expanded sub queries’ from the top retrieved documents in a baseline ranking , or from different document clusters identified in this ranking [ 27 , 32 ] . Alternatively , using external resources , such as a query log , one could mine sub queries related to the initial query , by analysing patterns of query reformulations , or their distance to the initial query in a bipartite click through graph [ 3 , 31 ] . For instance , one could observe that documents clicked for the query ‘java’ are also likely to be clicked for the query ‘sun microsystems’ . Another observation could be that users frequently reformulate the query ‘java’ into ‘java development kit’ , and less frequently so into ‘java indonesia tourism’ .
In this work , we investigate the effectiveness of using query reformulations provided by three major Web search engines ( WSEs ) as the sub query generation mechanism Q of our diversification framework . To preserve anonymity , we refer to these search engines as A , B , and C . As further detailed in Section 5 , for each of these WSEs and each of the 50 TREC 2009 Web track queries used in our investigation , we derive two sets of sub queries , extracted in late July 2009 :
• related sub queries , as displayed alongside the results for the initial query , in the WSEs’ interface ,
• suggested sub queries , as displayed in a dropdown list , as the initial query is typed in the WSEs’ search box .
Table 1 shows the main statistics of the generated subqueries : the average number of sub queries per initial query , h|Q|i , the average length of the generated sub queries , h|qi|i , and the average number of results associated to each subquery according to the Google WSE,1 hnw(qi)i .

Table 1 : Statistics of the generated sub queries .
From Table 1 , we can observe that the three WSEs provide roughly the same number of sub queries on average , evenly distributed between related and suggested sub queries . The exception is WSE C , which provides almost double the number of related sub queries when compared to the other WSEs . 1For the sake of uniformity , we choose Google as a single source to derive result set statistics for the sub queries generated from the three considered WSEs .
The average sub query length is also very similar across the different WSEs , with the short sub queries resembling typical Web queries [ 19 ] . However , these sub queries are overall longer than the 50 queries considered in our experiments . Indeed , the TREC 2009 Web track queries have an average length of 2.1 terms . This observation suggests that the generated sub queries are likely to correspond to alternative specialisations of the initial queries [ 4 ] . Finally , the estimated result set size of the average sub query also shows a high similarity across WSEs , with the related sub queries yielding a consistently bigger size when compared to the suggested ones .
Although the precise mechanisms used by these WSEs for producing query reformulations are not publicly known , these mechanisms can be arguably regarded as delivering state of the art query log mining , even if only on the basis that the WSEs have a wealth of click data available . Moreover , by evaluating them as black box implementations of the sub query generation component of xQuAD , we can draw useful insights regarding their effectiveness in providing a diverse coverage of the aspects of an initial query .
423 Sub Query Importance
In order to favour sub queries more likely to represent aspects of interest to the user population , we propose three different ways of estimating the sub query importance component , P(qi|q ) , within our framework . The first of these can be seen as a baseline estimation mechanism , which considers all sub queries as being equally important : a given query , CRCS builds a centralised ranking of documents sampled from the different collections . The rank of each candidate collection is then computed based on its estimated size and the rank of its documents in the centralised ranking . Inspired by CRCS , we devise our third and final sub query importance estimation mechanism as : ic(qi|q ) = nc(qi ) maxqi∈Q nc(qi )
1
ˆnc(qi ) X d| P(d|qi)>0
τ − j(d , q ) ,
( 8 ) where nc(qi ) is the total number of results retrieved for qi in the local corpus , ˆnc(qi ) corresponds to the number of results associated to the sub query qi that are among the top τ ranked results for the initial query q , with j(d , q ) giving the ranking position of the document d with respect to q . Finally , the estimator ic(qi|q ) is further normalised to yield a probability distribution :
Pc(qi|q ) = ic(qi|q )
Pqj ∈Q ic(qj|q )
.

5 . EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
In this section , we describe the experimental setup that supports the evaluation of our proposed framework , which is reported in Section 6 . In particular , our experimentation aims to answer three main research questions :
1 . Does explicitly modelling the aspects of a query help in diversifying the results for this query ?
Pu(qi|q ) =
1 |Q|
,
( 6 )
2 . Are query suggestions provided by Web search engines an effective resource for explicit diversification ? where , as before , Q represents the set of sub queries generated with respect to the initial query q .
However , the relative importance of the sub queries generated from an initial query should ideally reflect the interest of information consumers ( ie , the user population ) in the particular aspect represented by each sub query [ 10 ] . This could be estimated , for instance , based on the relative frequency of each sub query in a query log . When no such data is available to estimate the interest of information consumers in a particular aspect , an alternative is to estimate the interest this aspect sparks from information providers . In particular , we propose to estimate the relative importance of each sub query based on how well it is covered by a given collection . Our next importance estimator builds upon this idea and relies once more on information available from all major Web search engines . It is given as :
Pw(qi|q ) = nw(qi )
Pqj ∈Q nw(qj )
,
( 7 ) where nw(qi ) is the estimated number of results retrieved for the sub query qi according to the search engine w . As discussed in Section 422 , we rely on estimates from Google . As an alternative to relying on an external resource , we propose an analogous estimator , which is solely based on a local corpus . In particular , we estimate the relative importance of each generated sub query , by considering the ranking produced for this sub query as a sample of the documents covering this sub query in the local corpus . This estimation mechanism is inspired by the Central Rank based Collection Selection ( CRCS [ 28 ] ) algorithm in distributed information retrieval . To rank distributed collections of documents for
3 . What is the impact of the components of xQuAD on the performance of the whole framework ?
In the following , we detail the document collection , the topics , and the metrics used in our evaluation . Additionally , we describe the baselines to which our approach is compared , including the training procedure to set their parameters , when necessary . The Terrier IR platform2 [ 21 ] is used for both indexing and retrieval , with Porter ’s stemmer and standard English stopwords removal . 5.1 Collection and Topics
Our experiments are conducted in the context of the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web track [ 9 ] . The goal of this task is to produce a ranking of documents for a given query that maximises the coverage of the possible aspects underlying this query , while reducing its overall redundancy with respect to the covered aspects . The test collection used in this task is the new TREC ClueWeb09 dataset.3 In our experiments , we consider a subset of this collection , as used in the TREC 2009 Web track , comprising a total of 50 million English Web documents .
A total of 50 topics were available for this task . Each topic includes from 3 to 8 sub topics , as identified by TREC assessors , with relevance judgements provided at the subtopic level . Figure 1 illustrates an example topic with different fields , including its identified sub topics . In our experiments , the ‘query’ field of a topic is used as the initial query . Besides the sub queries generated based on the 2http://wwwterrierorg 3http://bostonlticscmuedu/Data/clueweb09/

WSEs’ reformulations for each of the considered 50 queries , as discussed in Section 422 , we build an alternative set of sub queries from the provided official sub topics . This provides an upper bound sub query generation mechanism for evaluating the sub queries derived from the considered WSEs . Moreover , by employing this upper bound as a uniform , standard setting , we can focus on evaluating the diversification strategy deployed by our framework compared to that of state of the art diversification approaches . 5.2 Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation results in the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web track are reported according to two official metrics : α NDCG and IA P . The α normalised discounted cumulative gain ( α NDCG [ 10 ] ) metric balances relevance and diversity through the tuning parameter α . The larger the value of α , the more diversity is rewarded . In contrast , when α = 0 , only relevance is rewarded , and this metric is equivalent to the traditional NDCG [ 20 ] .
Besides α NDCG , our evaluation is also based on a generalisation of standard IR metrics that rewards the diversity of a ranking . In particular , we use the intent aware precision ( IA P [ 1 ] ) metric , which extends the traditional notion of precision in order to account for the possible aspects underlying a query and their relative importance .
In our evaluation , both α NDCG and IA P are reported at three different rank cutoffs : 5 , 10 , and 100 . These cutoffs focus on the evaluation at early ranks , which are particularly important in a Web search context [ 19 ] . Both α NDCG and IA P are computed following the standard practice in the TREC 2009 Web track [ 9 ] . In particular , α NDCG is computed with α = 0.5 , in order to give equal weights to both relevance and diversity , and IA P is computed with all query aspects considered equally important . 5.3 Retrieval Baselines
We evaluate the effectiveness of xQuAD at diversifying the search results produced by three effective probabilistic document weighting models : BM25 [ 25 ] , the DPH Divergence From Randomness ( DFR ) model [ 2 ] , and Hiemstra ’s language modelling ( LM ) [ 17 ] . In particular , we employ

As discussed in Section 421 , these weighting models are used to produce both a baseline ranking as well as the sub rankings for different sub queries .
Besides the baseline ranking produced for an initial query , we compare xQuAD to both implicit and explicit diversification approaches , deployed on top of this baseline ranking . To differentiate between these approaches and the baseline ranking , the former are referred to as diversification baselines . These include the approaches of Carbonell and Goldstein [ 5 ] , Radlinski and Dumais [ 23 ] , and Agrawal et al . [ 1 ] , described in Section 2 . In particular , the last two make use of external resources or judgements , such as query logs or a classification taxonomy , which are not available for the test collection at hand . Therefore , we simulate their best case scenario , by considering the official sub topics provided by the collection as input to their diversification models . To simulate the approach of Radlinski and Dumais [ 23 ] , the official Web track sub topics are directly used as a proxy for query log reformulations . As for the approach of Agrawal et al . [ 1 ] , the official sub topics are used as a representation of taxonomy classes . The confidence of the classification of a document to a given class , in turn , is surrogated by the estimated relevance of the document to the sub topic that represents the class . All techniques are applied to re rank the top τ = 1000 documents retrieved by the baseline ranking for each query .

As discussed in Section 4 , the xQuAD framework is based on a mixture of a relevance component and a diversity component , parameterised by λ . In order to illustrate the tradeoff between these two components , Figure 2 shows the performance of xQuAD when varying the parameter λ , with the official TREC sub topics used as sub queries . From Figure 2 , we observe that our framework consistently improves over the baseline ranking ( λ = 0 ) for a range of λ values , with a peak around 0.15 for both BM25 and DPH . For LM , which exhibits a lower performance , a more aggressive diversification approach ( ie , a larger λ ) seems more appropriate . In our experiments , in order to train λ , we perform a 5 fold cross validation over the 50 topics , optimising for α
NDCG@10 , the primary evaluation metric at the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web track . The same approach is used to train a similar interpolation parameter employed by MMR , in order to trade off its relevance and novelty estimations [ 5 ] . Note that the approaches of Radlinski and Dumais [ 23 ] and Agrawal et al . [ 1 ] do not require training under their simulated best case scenario .
6 . EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
In this section , we thoroughly evaluate the xQuAD framework and the impact of its components on a diversification task . In order to answer the main research questions stated in Section 5 , we proceed as follows . In Section 6.1 , we assess the diversification effectiveness of xQuAD , by comparing it to state of the art diversification approaches in their simulated best case scenario , as described in Section 5 . In Section 621 , we investigate the impact of the sub query generation component in our framework , by comparing the performance of xQuAD using related and suggested subqueries provided by major WSEs . In Section 622 , we evaluate the three sub query importance estimation mechanisms introduced in Section 423 Finally , in Section 623 , by attempting to improve the baseline ranking and also the subrankings , we evaluate the impact of the relevance , coverage , and novelty components on the performance of xQuAD . 6.1 Framework Performance
In this experiment , we aim to answer the first of our stated research questions , namely , whether accounting for the aspects underlying a query in an explicit way helps diversifying the results for this query . To investigate this , we evaluate the performance of xQuAD at diversifying the baseline rankings produced by three different weighting models : BM25 , DPH , and LM . Additionally , we compare its performance to that of three diversification baselines . The classical MMR method of Carbonell and Goldstein [ 5 ] is used as a representative of implicit diversification approaches . As explicit diversification baselines , we consider simulated versions of the approaches of Radlinski and Dumais [ 23 ] and Agrawal et al . [ 1 ] , which we refer to as Q Filter and IA Select , respectively . As discussed in Section 5 , in our simulation , we experiment with both xQuAD and these explicit diversification baselines using the official TREC 2009 Web track sub topics . By doing so , we can isolate the impact of the query generation component and focus on comparing the diversification strategies provided by these approaches .
Table 2 shows the results of this evaluation in terms of α NDCG and IA P . The best result per baseline ranking is highlighted in bold . To provide a fair comparison to the diversification baselines , which do not take into account the relative importance of different query aspects , xQuAD is applied with the Pu importance estimator , as given by Equation ( 6 ) . Accordingly , it is denoted xQuADu .
From Table 2 , we first observe that xQuAD markedly outIn performs the diversification baselines in most settings . particular , it is the only approach that consistently improves the initial baseline ranking provided by BM25 , DPH , and LM , with gains of up to 30 % ( BM25 , α NDCG@5 ) . The only exception is IA P for the DPH baseline ranking , in which case the initial ranking itself performs the best , followed closely by the other approaches . However , none of these differences is statistically significant , according to the Wilcoxon signed rank test with p < 005 A further investigation

Table 2 : Diversification performance using the official TREC 2009 Web track diversity sub topics . shows that the considered weighting models underperform for some queries , particularly at earlier ranks , as emphasised by the reported metrics . We hypothesise that improving the relevance estimations produced by these weighting models could result in further improvements . An initial analysis in this direction is conducted in Section 623 Overall , the obtained results attest the effectiveness of the explicit diversification strategy implemented by xQuAD when compared to other diversification approaches . 6.2 Components Performance
In the previous section , we have demonstrated the effectiveness of the xQuAD framework for search result diversification across different baseline rankings , when compared to state of the art diversification approaches . In the remainder of this section , we investigate the performance of alternative implementations for its components , and how they impact the performance of the framework as a whole .
621 Sub Query Generation
Recalling our main research questions , in this experiment , we investigate the effectiveness of using query reformulations provided by three major WSEs for the diversification task . In particular , we resort to the related and suggested subqueries provided by these WSEs in order to implement the sub query generation component of xQuAD . Table 3 shows the performance of xQuAD using the obtained sub queries to re rank the results provided by the same baseline rankings used in the previous experiment , namely , BM25 , DPH , and LM . The best performance with respect to each of these baselines is highlighted in bold . Once again , xQuAD is applied with the Pu sub query importance estimator .
From Table 3 , we first observe that , in general , a lower performance is obtained when compared to the results in Table 2 , which simulate an upper bound query generation mechanism . Nonetheless , improvements over the initial ranking are still obtained in most settings . When we compare the performance of xQuAD using query reformulations provided by the three WSEs , no clear trend can be observed . This suggests that the considered WSEs’ query reformulation mechanisms perform comparably , at least in terms of their effectiveness in covering diverse aspects of an initial query . A distinction can be made , however , between the two types of sub queries derived from the WSEs . In partic

Table 4 : Diversification performance using different sub query importance estimators . ular , the suggested sub queries outperform the related ones in most settings . Looking back at Table 1 , the observation that the suggested sub queries tend to produce considerably smaller result sets might be an indication of their suitability in discriminating between different aspects of a query .
622 Sub Query Importance
Besides generating a quality set of sub queries , we hypothesise that the relative importance given to each sub query might influence the overall diversification performance of our framework . To investigate this , we experiment with xQuAD using three different sub query importance estimators , as introduced in Section 423 In particular , Table 4 shows the performance of xQuAD using two collection based importance estimators when compared to the previously introduced uniform importance estimator , Pu . As discussed in Section 423 , the Pw estimator ( Equation ( 7 ) ) is based on the result set size produced for a given sub query , as estimated by the Google WSE , whereas Pc ( Equation ( 9 ) ) relies on estimates derived from the target collection itself , inspired by a resource selection approach . In Table 4 , the use of these estimators is denoted by their respective subscripts being used by xQuAD ( eg , xQuADu stands for the use of xQuAD with the Pu importance estimator ) . As in the previous experiments , the diversification performance is evaluated across three baseline rankings and measured according to α NDCG and IA P at different cutoffs . The best value for each baseline ranking and each evaluation metric is highlighted in bold .
From Table 4 , we observe that the Pu estimator consistently outperforms the others . Among the collection based estimators ( ie , Pw and Pc ) , Pw generally performs better . As discussed in Section 423 , this estimator is based on a much bigger resource than the ClueWeb09 dataset , namely , the Google index . An exception is the LM baseline , which markedly benefits from our resource selection inspired estimator , Pc , in terms of both α NDCG and IA P . Overall , the best performance attained by the simpler uniform estimator is not totally unexpected , since neither α NDCG nor IA P reward approaches that take non uniform aspect importance distributions into account.4 Nevertheless , we hypothesise that a good importance estimator might be related to features other than the relative popularity of a sub query . For instance , the overlap between the sub rankings produced for different sub queries may have an impact on the performance of xQuAD , as its coverage and novelty components estimate the relevance of a document to multiple sub queries . This investigation , however , is left for future work .
623 Relevance , Coverage , and Novelty
Sections 621 and 622 investigated the impact of different sub query generation and importance estimators , respectively , on the performance of xQuAD . In this section , we investigate the influence of three other important components of our framework . As described in Section 421 , the relevance component is based on relevance estimations with respect to the initial query , while the coverage and novelty components depend on relevance estimations with respect to sub queries . Accordingly , we experiment with xQuAD by improving the document weighting models that have been used so far for estimating these three components .
In this experiment , we apply the pBiL proximity model from the DFR framework [ 22 ] , in order to favour documents in which the query terms appear in close proximity . In particular , variants of this model were shown to improve ad hoc retrieval performance on several TREC collections [ 15 ] . In our investigation , we apply this model to both the baseline ranking ( the relevance component ) as well as the sub rankings generated for the various identi
4Although the IA P metric can account for the relative importance of different query aspects , it is not trivial to derive a ground truth importance distribution for evaluation purposes . Hence , as discussed in Section 5.2 , IA P is computed assuming that all aspects are equally important , in accordance with the TREC 2009 Web track setup .

Table 5 presents the results of this investigation . In the table , ( b ) and ( s ) stand for the application of the pBiL proximity model in order to enhance the baseline ranking and the sub rankings , respectively , whereas ( bs ) account for the application of this technique to both components . For uniformity , once again , xQuAD is applied with the Pu importance estimator . The performance of xQuAD without any enhancement is included as an additional baseline .
From Table 5 , we can observe that the diversification performance of xQuAD can be further improved by improving the baseline ranking ( b ) , the sub rankings ( s ) , or both ( bs ) . Note , however , that these improvements are only consistent when the initially weaker LM baseline is considered . In the case of LM , improvements can be substantial , for both the α NDCG and IA P metrics and across all cutoffs , particularly when all three components are improved ( the ( bs ) variant ) . Nonetheless , for BM25 and DPH , improving the performance of individual components can also harm the diversification performance of xQuAD as a whole . This is likely due to the aforementioned tradeoff between relevance and diversity ( as illustrated in Figure 2 ) , and could probably be overcome by having the xQuAD ’s mixing parameter λ appropriately trained for the enhanced components .
As a final observation , we note that improvements on these components may also impact the performance of other components . To illustrate this effect , Table 6 presents similar results to those presented in Table 5 , however using our resource selection inspired importance estimator ( Pc ) instead of the uniform one ( Pu ) . In particular , as this estimator takes into account how well the documents retrieved for a particular sub query are ranked with respect to the initial query , it can substantially benefit from improvements to both the baseline ranking and the sub rankings .
As shown in Table 6 , improvements can be attained on top of all baselines , and are particularly marked for the LM baseline . Indeed , the performance of xQuAD on top of this relatively weaker baseline is raised to a comparable level as that of our framework using BM25 or DPH . This observation attests the potential benefit of improving the relevance , coverage , and novelty components of xQuAD . Furthermore , it highlights the benefit of handling these components within a unified diversification framework , which allows for different estimation choices to be made in a principled manner .
7 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper , we have introduced a novel probabilistic framework for search result diversification . In particular , the xQuAD ( eXplicit Query Aspect Diversification ) framework explicitly models the aspects underlying an initial query , in the form of sub queries . Instead of comparing documents to one another—which usually demands expensive computations—our approach achieves an effective diversification performance by directly estimating the relevance of the retrieved documents to multiple sub queries . Besides being efficient in practice , the principled formulation of xQuAD naturally models several dimensions of interest in a diversification task , as components within the framework . These include the relevance of a document to an initial query and its multiple aspects , identified as sub queries , as well as the relative importance of each sub query and how novel a document satisfying each sub query is .
We have thoroughly investigated the effectiveness of the xQuAD framework at diversifying Web search results , within the standard experimentation paradigm provided by the diversity task of the TREC 2009 Web track . In particular , by simulating an upper bound sub query generation mechanism , we have shown that our framework outperforms existing implicit and explicit diversification approaches across several settings . By investigating the impact of each of the components of our framework , we have shown that effective sub queries can be generated based on query reformulations provided by major Web search engines . Reformulations provided in the form of suggested queries showed encouraging promise in generating a diverse representation of the aspects underlying an initial query . Moreover , we have experimented with different mechanisms to estimate the relative importance of each uncovered sub query , based on statistics derived from both the local collection and from the index of the Google WSE . Our results have shown that these estimators can bring further performance improvements , particularly when associated with a better estimation of the relevance and coverage components of xQuAD .
In the future , we plan to further improve xQuAD by investigating alternative mechanisms for estimating each of its components . For instance , different query reformulation approaches could be investigated in order to generate effective sub queries , as well as to better estimate their relative importance with respect to other sub queries . In addition , the relevance , coverage , and novelty components could be enhanced by the deployment of more sophisticated document retrieval techniques . A promising direction for investigation is the analysis of the type of each individual sub query ( eg , navigational sub queries are likely to benefit more from the use of link analysis than informational ones ) .
