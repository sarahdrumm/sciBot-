ABSTRACT This paper presents an innovative style wise advertising platform for web page . Web page “ style ” mainly refers to visual effects , such as color and layout . Unlike the most popular ad network such as Google AdSense which needs publishers to change the original structure of their pages and define the position and style of the embedded ads manually , stylewise page advertising aims to automatically deliver styleconsistent ads at proper positions within the web page , without breaking the layout of the original page . Our system is motivated from the fact that almost 90 % web pages contain blank regions without any content . Given a web page with some blank regions , style wise page advertising is able to detect the suitable blank areas for advertising , rank the ads according to the semantic relevance and web page style , and embed relevant ads into these nonintrusive areas . Style wise page advertising represents one of the first attempts towards contextual advertising which enables the publishers to save effort when applying online advertising services .

We have witnessed a fast growing and great potential market of online advertising in recent years . Many existing ad networks such as Google AdSense [ 1 ] have provided contextual advertising services which associates advertisements with an web page . With AdSense , the owners of websites can display contextually relevant , unobtrusive Google ads on their website ’s pages to earn money . However , Adsense ads are located in the fixed corner of the Web page . Moveover , it need the publishers to define the style of the delivered ads to match their own pages . For image ads , Adsense does not consider whether the ad images match the style of the host page . We argue that inserting ads at preserved and fixed positions destroys the visually appealing appearance and structure of the original web page . We also believe that the ads which are relevant to the page style will reduce the intrusiveness of the ads .
It is witnessed that web pages usually have some blank regions without any informative content , as shown in Figure 1(a ) . Table 1 shows the ad formats of Google Adsense . The

40 % size of ad format ranges from about 10,000 to 100,000 pixels . Based on the sizes that Google ads use , we conduct an experiment to investigate if web pages contain blank areas which are suitable for delivering ads . According to Alexa.com ’s traffic statistics , we analyze the top 1,000 web sites’ homepages and find that large percentage of web pages have blank areas which are large enough for inserting ads . Figure 2 shows the results . We believe that there are two benefits of delivering ads on the blank regions of the web page : 1)The blank regions sometimes make the web page unbeautiful . The embedded ads which are consistent with the style of ad landing page will probably complement the blank area and improve the user ’s viewing experience ; 2 ) No predefined ad blocks are to be preserved which enables the publishers to save effort when applying contextual advertising service .
Motivated by the above observations , we demonstrate our novel advertising system in this work . The proposed system , named PageSense , supports contextual web page advertising by associating the most relevant ads to web page content as well as web page style . In order to minimize intrusiveness to the users , the ads should be delivered on the blank areas within the web page so that the ads don’t affect users’ viewing experience . The ad insertion positions are detected based on image analysis . Figure 1(b ) shows a snapshot of the example subscribing our style wise advertising service . It is observed that the relevant ads have been inserted into the blank region within the web page .
2 . RELATED WORK
Many efforts have been devoted to online advertising which can be categorized into two dimensions , ad relevance matching and ad position detection .
Research on ad relevance matching can be further classified into three directions from the perspective of what the ads are matched against : keyword targeted , contenttargeted , and user targeted advertising . Typical keywordtargeted advertising analyzes a web page or query to find prominent keywords , and then match these keywords against the words for which advertisers bid [ 2][3][4 ] . In contenttargeted advertising ( also called “ contextual advertising ” ) , the ads are associated with the web page content rather than the keywords [ 5][6][7][8 ] . In user targeted advertising , the ads are driven based on user profile and demography [ 9 ] , or behavior [ 10][11 ] .
In addition to the relevance , it is important to insert the

Mei et al . proposed how to detect appropriate insertion positions in the video stream [ 12 ] and within the image [ 13 ] to reduce the intrusiveness .
3 . SYSTEM OVERVIEW
Figure 3 illustrates the framework of demonstration system . The system consists of three major components : ( 1 ) ad matching engine , ( 2 ) ad position detection engine , and ( 3 ) ad delivery engine .
The ad matching engine matches the web page with ads based on category relevance , text relevance and style consistence . Ad insertion point detection engine detects the blank area for ad insertion , so that the informative content of the host page will not be occluded and users may not feel intrusive to the inserted advertisement . The ad delivery engine delivers and renders the relevant ads at blank areas within web page .
4 . SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION 4.1 Ad Ranking
Conventional contextual advertising primarily matches ads to web pages based on categories or prominent keywords which are regarded as semantic meaning . Besides the semantic relevance between the ad and ad landing page , the ad should be consistent with the style of web page . Therefore , given a web page P , we introduce the following three relevance items for each ad x .
• Category relevance RC ( P , x ) : It measures if the ad x and ad landing page P belong to the same or compatible categories . The web categorization is based on the SVM classifier on text and web link analysis[14 ] . • Keyword relevance RT ( P , x ) : It measures the relevance between the keywords or named entities extracted from the web page and the text information associated with the ad .
• Style relevance RV ( P , x ) : It measures the style consistency between the ad and the page . The ad is assumed to have similar appearance with the page , so

We fuse the relevance scores from category , keyword and style to give a more reasonable judgment , ie multimodal relevance . It is determined by the following formulation :
R(P , x ) = RC ( P , x ) + RT ( P , x ) + RV ( P , x )
( 1 )
Since our system supports multiple ads on the same web page , The N ads X = {xi}N i=1 with the highest scores of equation ( 1 ) are selected as relevant ads which will be delivered to the web page . N is decided by the publisher and the default value is 10 . 4.2 Ad Position Detection
The process of ad position detection is shown in Figure 4 . First , the web page is crawled and converted into snapshot image . Secondly , the snapshot image is processed and converted into grey scale image . Third , we detect the blank area within the grey scale image based on image analysis . The blank area is the candidate position for delivering ads . Finally , we calculate the ad position relative to the original page . 4.3 Ad Delivery
Publishers only need to insert a piece of HTML codes at the bottom of their own web pages , then relevant ads will emerge on the blank regions of the web page .
The inserted HTML code is able to download a javascript file which handles the ad delivery . First , the current page ’s URL is sent back to a web service in the back end . Second , the web service will crawl the web page and detect the blank areas . Third , the HTML layers embedded with ads will be delivered to the browser and overlay on the blank areas .
According to the size of the insertion position , PageSense can choose one ad or multiple ads arranged in a rectangle . It also supports a variety of rendering effects such as displaying multiple ads which appear in turn like slideshow , fade in/fade out , dissolve in/dissolve out , and so on .
If there is no blank area within the page , the ads will float on the bottom right corner of the browser and only appear for certain duration , so that the users can still see the whole web page .
5 . EXPERIMENTS
We have collected 10,127 real selling products from Amazon.com as ads and top 1,000 websites’ homepages based on Alexa.com ’s traffic statistics , among which 100 randomly selected homepages are used for PageSense evaluations . We also collect 10 pages which subscribe AdSense service for comparison . The evaluation involves 30 human subjects , including 15 males and 15 females . These subjects are university students , teachers , medical people , IT people and finance people . The students and teachers are major in a wide variety of backgrounds , such as aeronautics , mathematics , computer science , business , physics , art , language , law , history , biology and so on . All the subjects’ ages range from 19 to 40 .
In our experiments , we compared each page of PageSense to each page of Google AdSense . As a result , there are 1,000 page pairs . Each pair is judged by three different subjects . The human subjects are asked to give scores ( 1 5 ) to show their satisfactions with respective to the following perspectives :
1 ) Position : How do you feel the position of the advertisement ? ( 5 : very good ; 4 : good to ; 3 : may be ; 2 : not good ; 1 : bad )
2 ) Impression : Does the ad impress you ? ( 5 : very impressive ; 4 : impressive ; 3 : may be ; 2 : not too impressive ; 1 : unimpressive )
3 ) Acceptance : If you own a web page , are you willing to put it on your site ? ( 5 : very willing to ; 4 : willing to ; 3 : may be ; 2 : not too willing to ; 1 : not willing to )
4 ) Overall effectiveness : Is it an effective way to deliver the ad ? How do you think of the overall effectiveness of advertising ? ( 5 : very good ; 4 : good to ; 3 : may be ; 2 : not good ; 1 : bad )
Figure 5 shows the evaluation results . The higher score indicates the higher satisfaction . It is observed that AdSense outperformed PageSense with slight margin in terms of position , while PageSense achieved better satisfactions than AdSense with respect to other perspectives , ie impression , acceptance and overall effectiveness . Because AdSense ’s ad positions are defined manually , while PageSense ’s are detected automatically , it is reasonable to see that AdSense achieved the higher score than PageSense in terms of position . The score of PageSense is indeed closely approaching that of Google AdSense , though the former does not involve

The PageSense delivers the image based ads which support a variety of rendering effects . Moreover , PageSense ads are consistent with the ad landing page ’s color style . Most of the evaluators think PageSense ads are more impressive than AdSense ads .
6 . CONCLUSIONS
We have demonstrated a novel web page advertising platform named PageSense that supports not only “ contextually relevant ” but also “ less intrusive ” online advertising . This platform automatically matches ads to the content and style of web page , delivers relevant ads on the blank area within the page , without breaking the original structure of the web page by only inserting a piece of code .
The future work includes further defining the style consistence , and making the ads user targeted in terms of user behavior and social context .
