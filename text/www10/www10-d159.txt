ABSTRACT Queries on major Web search engines produce complex result pages , primarily composed of two types of information : organic results , that is , short descriptions and links to relevant Web pages , and sponsored search results , the small textual advertisements often displayed above or to the right of the organic results . Strategies for optimizing each type of result in isolation and the consequent user reaction have been extensively studied ; however , the interplay between these two complementary sources of information has been ignored , a situation we aim to change . Our findings indicate that their perceived relative usefulness ( as evidenced by user clicks ) depends on the nature of the query . Specifically , we found that for navigational queries there is a clear competition between ads and organic results , while for nonnavigational queries this competition turns into synergy .
We also investigate the relationship between the perceived usefulness of the ads and their textual similarity to the organic results , and propose a model that formalizes this relationship . To this end , we introduce the notion of responsive ads , which directly address the user ’s information need , and incidental ads , which are only tangentially related to that need . Our findings support the hypothesis that in the case of navigational queries , which are usually fully satisfied by the top organic result , incidental ads are perceived as more valuable than responsive ads , which are likely to be duplicative . On the other hand , in the case of non navigational queries , incidental ads are perceived as less beneficial , possibly because they diverge too far from the actual user need . We hope that our findings and further research in this area will allow search engines to tune ad selection for an increased synergy between organic and sponsored results , leading to both higher user satisfaction and better monetization .

INTRODUCTION
“ in an information rich world , the wealth of information means a dearth of something else : a scarcity of whatever it is that information consumes . What information consumes is rather obvious : it consumes the attention of its recipients . Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention and a need to allocate that attention efficiently among the overabundance of information sources that might consume it . ” – Herbert Simon , “ Designing Organizations for an Information Rich World ” , 1971 .
The development of Web search has led to a paradigm shift in information access , as huge amounts of information became accessible to anyone with a basic Internet connection and minimal search skills ; indeed , users worldwide send hundreds of millions of queries to Web search engines every day . At the same time , the invention of search advertising ( or sponsored search ) turned Web search into an easily monetizable activity , by allowing advertisers to target interested audiences . As a result , the search engine result pages ( SERPs ) today are primarily composed of two types of information : organic results , that is , short descriptions ( “ snippets ” ) and links to relevant Web pages , and sponsored search results , the small textual advertisements displayed alongside the organic results . The two types are clearly separated on the SERP , with the ads being marked as “ sponsored links ” or “ sponsored results ” . Most ads are displayed on the right hand side on the page ( East ads ) , but some ads might be shown above the organic results ( North ads ) .
There are some fundamental differences between the organic results and the ads . First , for every query , organic results aim to satisfy the most likely user intent(s ) as inferred from the query , while ads tend to focus on potential commercial intent(s ) . Second , while organic results are ranked solely based on relevance , ad ranking jointly optimizes relevance and revenue . Lastly , the “ snippets ” associated with organic results are usually computer generated by a summarization algorithm , while most ads are manually crafted , as is the practice in the classic advertising industry . ( In fact , following the same practice , the body of sponsored search ads is called a creative , supposedly produced by an ad agency . )
Nevertheless , both ads and organic results provide information to the user . While several papers considered the interaction of the user with the ads [ 2 , 14 , 13 , 7 , 5 , 8 ] and the Web results [ 16 , 17 , 1 ] in isolation , to the best of our knowledge , no study considered the interplay between these two sources of information . If we take the click rate as evidence of user perceived usefulness , we can conceivably observe three situations :
1 . The clickthrough rates on these two types of results are negatively correlated , possibly indicating that ads and organic results compete for user attention and/or satisfy different intents .
2 . The rates are uncorrelated , possibly indicating that users treat ads and organic results as independent sources of information .
3 . The rates are positively correlated , possibly indicating mutually reinforcing effects or quality similarity .
Clearly the situation depends on the nature of the user ’s query and the user ’s intent , as well as on the characteristics of both types of results . Indeed , we found out that for navigational queries ( in the sense of [ 3 ] ) there is a clear competition between ads and organic results , while for nonnavigational queries , the competition turns into synergy , as the two sources together appear to satisfy the user ’s information need better than either source alone .
To further elucidate these observations , we investigate the relationship between the perceived usefulness of the ads and their textual similarity to the organic results , and propose a model that formalizes this relationship . To this end , we introduce the notion of responsive ads , which directly address the user ’s information need , and incidental ads , which are only tangentially related to that need . Our findings support the hypothesis that in the case of navigational queries , which are usually fully satisfied by the top organic result , incidental ads are perceived as more valuable than responsive ones , which are likely to be duplicative . On the other hand , in the case of informational queries , incidental ads are perceived as less beneficial , possibly because they diverge too far from the actual user need .
The main contributions of this paper are as following . We study the interplay between the two main parts of the search engine results page , namely , the organic results and the ads . We juxtapose the clickthrough rates on these two sources of information to identify when their synergy turns into an explicit competition for users’ attention . We also introduce the notions of responsive and incidental ads , which help us understand when a high degree of topical similarity is desired between the organic results and the ads , and in which cases such similarity turns out to be detrimental . We believe our findings will lead to richer Web search experience , where the increased synergy between the organic and the sponsored results yields higher overall users’ satisfaction .
2 . BACKGROUND : TEXTUAL ADVERTIS
ING ON THE WEB
A large part of the $21 billion Web advertising market consists of textual ads , the ubiquitous short text messages usually marked as “ sponsored links ” . There are two main channels for distributing such ads . a . Sponsored search places ads on the result pages of a Web search engine , where ads are selected to be relevant to the search query ( see [ 10 ] for a brief history of the subject ) . All major Web search engines ( Google ,
Microsoft , Yahoo! ) support sponsored ads and act simultaneously as a Web search engine and an ad search engine . b . Content match ( or contextual advertising ) places ads on third party Web pages .
In this paper we focus on sponsored search , which is an interplay of the following three entities .
1 . The advertiser provides the supply of ads . As in traditional advertising , the goal of the advertisers can be broadly defined as promotion of products or services .
2 . The search engine provides “ real estate ” for placing ads ( ie , allocates space on search results pages ) , and selects ads that are relevant to the user ’s query .
3 . Users visit the Web pages and interact with the ads .
The prevalent pricing model for textual ads is that the advertisers pay a certain amount for every click on the advertisement ( pay per click or PPC ) .
The amount paid by the advertiser for each sponsored search click is usually determined by an auction process [ 9 ] . The advertisers place bids on various search phrases , with the intent that queries matching these bid phrases will trigger the corresponding ads ; when a query triggers multiple ads , their relative position is determined by their bids , as explained below .
Thus , each ad is associated with one or more bid phrases . In addition to bids and bid phrases , each ad must specify a title usually displayed in bold font , a creative , which is the few lines of text forming the body of the ad , and a target URL , which is the result of clicking on the ad .
In the model currently used by all the major search engines , bid phrases serve a dual purpose : they explicitly specify queries that should trigger the ad and simultaneously put a price tag on a click event . Obviously , these price tags could be different for different queries . For example , a flooring contractor advertising his services on the Internet might be willing to pay a small amount of money when his ads are clicked from general queries such as “ home remodeling ” , but higher amounts if the ads are clicked from more focused queries such as “ hardwood floors ” or “ laminate flooring ” .
Most often , ads are shown for queries that are quasiidentical to the bid phrases for the ad , thus resulting in an exact match between the query and the bid phrase . However , it might be difficult ( or even impossible ) for an advertiser to list all the relevant queries ahead of time . Hence , search engines , provide broad ( or advanced ) match , whereby advertisers allow the search engines to decide what queries are suitable for triggering their ads based on the bid phrases already provided .
Given a query q , the revenue from a click can be estimated as
R = Xi=1k
P ( click|q , ai ) · price(ai , i ) , where k is the number of ads displayed on the page with search results for q and price(ai , i ) is the click price of the ad ai at position i . The price depends on the set of ads competing for display on the result page and their respective bids . Several models have been proposed to determine this price , most of them based on generalizations and variants of second price ( GSP ) auctions . For more details , see [ 9 ] and references therein .
Users’ attitude towards search advertising has evolved since the inception of Web search some 15 years ago . While today it is an accepted fact that search engines are supported by advertising on the SERP , the first attempt by AltaVista to combine organic and sponsored search results was met with a huge public outcry [ 19 ] . Even now , although ads are ubiquitous , all major search engines limit the number of ads and their position to mitigate any negative impact on users’ experience .
3 . DATA
We formed a virtual search result page SERPv ( v indicates “ virtual ” ) for each query q as described below . We collected all organic and sponsored search results displayed within one month time frame by a certain set of Yahoo! Search servers for queries issued at least 100 times . In order to mitigate presentation effects , we consider only the North ads , that is , the ads displayed above organic results in a manner relatively similar to the organic ads themselves , within a block marked “ Sponsored Results ” . Furthermore , we discarded all queries for which no North ad was displayed .
All these restrictions aim to reduce the probable causes of observed users’ reactions to differences in displayed content and/or users’ inherent preference for organic vs . ad results . ( A side effect of this selection is that queries included in our dataset might be of more commercial interest than a random sample since only such queries are likely to trigger North ads . ) While North ads may have an advantage over organic results given that they are displayed earlier in the page , note that the average CTR ( click through rate , defined as the ratio between the number of times a result was clicked and the number of times it was shown ) for organic results is still higher than the average CTR for ads . We discuss the non commercial bias , that is , user ’s preference for organic results , in more detail in Section 41
Among the results collected as described , we kept only those that had been shown for at least Nv times . For our investigation , we need to estimate the CTR for each result , be it organic or sponsored . For reliability , we set Nv to 50 for most analyses conducted in the paper ; the only exception is the prediction experiments described in Section 5.4 , where we set Nv = 10 to keep more datapoints . In what follows , we use SERPv to denote the virtual SERP that consists of all organic and North ad results that had been displayed for a given query for at least Nv times .
Next , we picked a pair of sponsored and organic results from each SERPv that were deemed suitable for meaningful comparisons . The first possibility we considered was to pick the topmost results in their respective blocks , since they are the most comparable ones in terms of page position . However , it turned out that the notion of “ topmost ” is not well defined in a SERPv : given the vagaries of the ad marketplace , the order of the ads is highly variable ; in fact , even the order of the organic results is not always consistent . Thus , we constructed the pair by employing the users’ implicit feedback as an indication of which results were the most comparable : for each query qi , we took the most clicked ad ( A∗i ) and the most clicked organic search result ( O∗i ) from its SERPv . We denote the CTR of A∗i and O∗i as ctrAi and ctrOi , respectively . ( We omit the subscript i when referring to the results for a random query q . )
The procedure described above yielded a collection of 63,789
( qi , O∗i , A∗i ) tuples . All our subsequent analyses were con ducted on this dataset , unless specified otherwise . One potential concern was that our observations were specific to our choice of ( O∗i , A∗i ) pairs . To ease such concerns , we also conducted our analyses over all the ads present in SERPv — a total of 332,607 ( qi , O∗i , Ak i ranged over all North ads displayed for qi — and we observed the same qualitative results . Thus , while we do not refer back to this extended dataset in the rest of the paper , it is important to keep in mind that all the following discussions are also valid for this alternate setting . i ) tuples1 where Ak
Note that in order to focus on meaningful observations , all plots in this paper include only the points that represent at least 2 % of the considered tuples . In addition , in order to avoid disclosing commercially sensitive data , we transformed raw CTR values via a linear transformation into relative CTR values .
4 . RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AD AND OR
GANIC CTR
Consider a user who is taken to a search result page after issuing a query . Both organic and sponsored search results are presented on the page , vying for the user ’s attention . Is the user going to click on the organic results or on the ads ? Clearly the answer varies from query to query , depending on the nature of the user ’s information need , as well as the quality of both types of results . Nonetheless , it is interesting to investigate whether there is any interesting signal at the aggregated level .
We start by examining the basic relationship between organic CTR and ad CTR . In particular , we study the relationship between ctrO and ctrA , ie , the highest organic and sponsored search CTR for each query . 4.1 Non commercial bias
Position bias has been shown to play an important part in a user ’s perception of different search results in a SERP [ 15 ] . Similarly there can be a bias based on whether the result is displayed in the organic region and or the sponsored region . Indeed , previous work has suggested that users have a bias against sponsored search results [ 12 ] . This was confirmed by our findings .
In particular , we examined the set of queries for which the target URLs of A∗ and O∗ shared the same domain . There are a significant number of such queries ( in our case 13.5 % of all the queries in our dataset ) , since some advertisers have an interest in holding prominent positions in both ads and organic results . In such cases , we expected A∗ and O∗ to be of almost identical quality , and most likely only one of them would be clicked on by a given user . This set of queries was as close as we could get to an equal quality setting to analyze users’ base preferences . We refer to this set as Qeq hereafter .
Given that all the ads in our dataset were North ads , if position bias was the dominating factor , we should observe that most users clicked on A∗ . As a result , the average ctrA should be much higher than the average ctrO in Qeq . On the other hand , users may prefer the organic results in spite
1Recall that SERPv contained all the North ads that were shown for this query during one month — while there were ( on average ) roughly 5 different North ads in each virtual SERPv , this did not mean that there were 5 North ads per physical SERP .

Figure 2 : Average organic clickthrough for different values of ad clickthrough . Best linear fits are shown for ( b ) and ( c ) in order to emphasize the respective trends . of the position bias . There can be two main reasons :
1 . Some users might not trust ads as much as they trust organic results , knowing that ads were paid to be shown . In the extreme case , some users might be decisively “ ad blind ” and simply ignore the entire block of ads altogether .
2 . Some users might be more likely to click on the organic result because it reinforces the message sent by the top ad .
Our observations supported a slight preference for organic results : for 52 % of the queries in Qeq we observed ctrO > ctrA , and the average ctrA was only 95 % of the average ctrO in Qeq . That is , in this equal quality setting , users did have a bias towards clicking on organic results in spite of their lower position . We refer to this preference as the non commercial bias .
4.2 Correlations ? The overall trend
In this section , we take a closer look at the relationship between ctrA and ctrO . Suppose we have two queries qi and qj , and we know ctrOi > ctrOj , does this tell us anything about ctrAi vs . ctrAj ? In other words , is there a clear pattern of the relationship between ctrA and ctrO ?
One hypothesis is that users’ perception of ads is independent of their perception of organic results , and we should expect no relation whatsoever . That is , the average ctrA for queries with specific ctrO should be relatively constant with respect to the value of ctrO – it would simply be the average ctrA for all queries .
However , we believe that a user has an integrated view of the sponsored and organic search results on a SERP . In particular , we hypothesize that there are two possible underlying forces that can lead to correlations :
• Antagonism : It is natural to assume that a user has limited time and energy to spend on a particular query , and thus she has to chose a selected few results she would click on and explore — in particular , she has to chose between ads and organics .
• Mutual growth : The mechanisms underlying ads retrieval and organic Web retrieval have their differences in most commercial search engines . Still , as queries are better served by the search engine , and the organic and ad results collectively better address the user ’s information need , both ctrO and ctrA can grow together at an aggregated level even as they compete for user ’s attention on each individual SERP .
Would one of these forces be the dominating factor , or would they cancel each other out and lead to no correlation ? In order to answer this question , we examined the average trend in the data we collected .
Let Q(x ) = {qi | ctrOi = x} be the set of queries whose best organic CTR is x , we computed the average ctrA for Q(x ) as avgA(x ) = Pqi∈Q(x ) ctrAi
|Q(x)|
Figure 1(a ) shows the overall trend of how avgA(x ) changes with respect to ctrO . We observe a clear non linear correlation between them , thus ruling out the independence hypothesis . However , neither of the two aforementioned forces explains the trend on its own . For relatively small ctrO values , we observe a mutual growth region , where avgA(x ) and ctrO are positively correlated ( ie , positive slope in the cubic2 fit ) . This is followed by an antagonistic region , where avgA(x ) and ctrO are negatively correlated ( ie , negative slope in the fit ) . It is important to bear in mind that as the points in Figure 1(a ) represent mean values , a positive slope should not be interpreted as ctrA monotonically increasing with ctrO at the individual query level .
Similarly we examined the average ctrO , or avgO(x ) , for different ctrA values ( Figure 2(a) ) . Note that this analysis is complementary to the one summarized in Figure 1(a ) : since the correlation we observe there is non linear , it would be possible for avgO(x ) to remain constant with respect to different ctrA values — for example , a flat line with zero slope in Figure 2(a ) could still be consistent with Figure 1(a ) . However , we can again observe both a a clear antagonistic region ( for lower ctrA ) and a mutual growth region ( for higher ctrA ) . 4.3 Navigational and non navigational queries In order to test whether the observed trend is indeed a result of the interplay between the two forces described in the previous section , we would like to decouple their effects . Ideally , we wish to separate the queries into two sets : one dominated by the antagonistic force , and the other dominated by mutual growth .
Our insight is to exploit the fact that the intensity of the the antagonistic force is dependent on the amount of time and effort a user is willing to spend on a particular query : the more time one invests , the more results one is willing to explore ( in the extreme case , one would click on all sponsored and organic results ) and the less competition there is ; the less time one dedicates to the the query , the less results one is going to explore and thus , a fiercer competition . It 2Piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation . is also natural to assume that the amount of effort invested depends on the type of the information need . In particular , if a user is looking for a particular site , as in the case of a “ Pandora Radio ” query , he might be willing to invest far less exploration time than a user who is looking for “ the meaning of life ” 3 .
Following this insight we separate the queries into navigational and non navigational queries , in accordance with the taxonomy of web search introduced in [ 3]4 . The purpose of navigational queries is to reach a particular site that the user has in mind , and for such queries there is usually only one “ right ” result ( wwwpandoracom in the case of our example ) . We expect users to dedicate less exploration time to navigational queries , and thus for the antagonistic effect to dominate .
We obtained a navigational score for each query in our dataset automatically from an internal classifier trained on manually labeled examples . The value of the navigational score was between 0 and 1 , representing the confidence of the query being navigational . The classifier was reported to yield an F1 score of 0.842 on queries randomly sampled from the most frequent one million queries in Yahoo! query log . To further confirm the accuracy of the navigational scores , we sampled a small set of 45 queries from our dataset , and asked a human annotator to label them into navigational and non navigational queries ( with high and low confidence ) . The following table shows the statistics of the navigational scores of the queries that received the respective manual labels : manual label navig , high confidence navig , low confidence non navig , low confidence non navig , high confidence mean 0.64 0.64 0.54 0.36 std . dev .
0.16 0.22 0.17 0.09
As we can see , the navigational scores are consistent with the human labels . In fact , out of the 36 queries that received high confidence labels , with the exception of two queries , all of the queries labeled as navigational by the annotator received higher navigational scores than those labeled as nonnavigational . Thus , we considered the navigational scores as a reasonable estimate of the likelihood of a query being navigational . We rank all queries by their navigational scores , and refer to the top decile as navigational* queries , and the bottom decile as non navigational* queries . These represent queries classified as navigational and non navigational with high confidence . 4.4 Dissecting the trend
Figure 1(b ) is a breakdown of Figure 1(a ) with respect to navigationality . The relation between avgA(x ) and ctrO for navigational* queries is shown in black ; in contrast , the same relation for non navigational* queries is shown in green ( the relation for the rest of the queries is shown in light blue ) .
We successfully decoupled the effects of the two forces : the antagonistic relationship dominates for navigational* queries , as the best line fit for these queries yields a steep
3Unless the user is just looking for the Monty Python movie . 4This work introduced three main types of queries : navigational , informational , and transactional . For our purposes we grouped the last two types together into the nonnavigational class . and negative slope . In comparison , the positive slope for the non navigational* queries indicates the dominance of mutual growth . Furthermore , as can be seen in Figure 1(c ) , there is a smooth transition between these two extreme cases : as the likelihood of the considered queries being navigational lowers , the slope gradually increases ( decreasing in magnitude ) , eventually turning positive for those least likely to be navigational . A similar decoupling of the antagonistic and mutual growth trends can be observed in Figure 2(b ) and Figure 2(c ) , further strengthening our observations . 4.5 Digression : the relation between the navi gational score and query difficulty
Intuitively , navigational scores can also play surrogate as a measure of the difficulty of queries : highly navigational queries are typically the easier ones for most commercial search engines . r t c e v i t l a e r n a e m

Figure 3 : Average organic / ads clickthrough vs . navigational scores .
Indeed , as we can see from Figure 3 , the average ctrO clearly increases with the navigational scores . In other words , for navigational queries , O∗ better satisfies the user ’s information need . We would like to note that higher ctrO does not necessarily prove the query is easier . Given the definition of navigational queries , it could be that users’ information need is more diverse for non navigational queries and the CTR was spread out more evenly among different search results . Interestingly , as shown in Figure 3 , the average ctrA increases with a much flatter slope with respect to navigational scores . The same “ concentration of CTR ” is not observed for the ads to the same degree .
Nonetheless , both ctrO and ctrA tend to be lower for queries with low navigational scores . Recall that this is the group of queries where mutual growth dominates . In other words , the mutual growth relationship dominates for those queries that were not best satisfied ( collectively ) by the best ad and organic results . 4.6 Ads vs . position two organics
Is this mix of mutual growth and antagonistic relationships something unique between ads and organics ? Or are they more generally applicable to any two items on a SERP ? We examined the relationship between the position one ( O1 ) and position two ( O2 ) organic results . As we can by comparing the plots in Figure 4 , the relationship between O2 CTR and the O1 CTR is to some extent similar to the

Indeed , the antagonistic relationship is in general more prominent between the two organic results . The explanations behind this difference is beyond the scope of this study .
Note also that had position bias dominated user perception , we would expect the relationship between A∗ and O1 to be similar to the relationship between O1 and O2 . Instead , A∗ behaves more like O2 in spite of the fact that it is shown above O1 .
5 . THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING DIFFER
ENT
In the previous section , we examined the interplay between the CTR of sponsored and organic search results . The next interesting question to ask is : in the context of a given set of organic search results , which ad is perceived as more useful ? If users take an integrated view of the entire search result page , what type of ads would they prefer : ads that are more similar to the organic results or those that provide diversity ?
Both hypotheses are plausible . Ads that are similar to the organic results have a higher chance of being relevant to the query ( assuming that the organic results are a reasonable representation of pages relevant to the query ) . Indeed , this idea has been exploited in the computational advertising literature . For instance , organic results have been used to classify queries with respect to a taxonomy designed for ad placement , which was subsequently used to improve search advertising [ 4 ] . In addition , as users tend to “ trust ” the noncommercial organic results , being similar to organic results may be subjectively perceived as evidence for high quality . On the other hand , ads too similar to the organic results can be perceived as redundant information . As we discussed in Section 4.1 , users prefer the organic results when A∗ and O∗ lead to the same site . Thus , being different from the organic results can have its advantage as it offers something not available from the organic results , which can help to overcome user ’s non commercial bias . Indeed , there have been studies showing that user experience can benefit from diversity in the top organic search results [ 11 , 18 , 6 ] . Since ads are an integrated part of a SERP , it is reasonable to hypothesize that users can also benefit from diversity among sponsored and organic search results .
5.1 Data analysis
For each SERPv , we computed the similarity between A∗ and O∗ . User studies have shown that the titles of sponsored and organic results play an important role when users are asked to judge the relevance of the results [ 12 ] . Based on this finding , we focused on a similarity measure computed from the titles of A∗ and O∗ . ( See Section 5.4 for other similarity measures that we considered . ) More specifically , let BA and BO be the set of terms ( ie , Bag of words ) that appeared in the titles of A∗ and O∗ , respectively . The similarity measure , which we refer to as overlap , is defined as the Jaccard similarity coefficient : overlap = |BA ∩ BO| |BA ∪ BO|
For instance , overlap ( “ Free Radio ” , “ Pandora Radio
Listen to Free Internet Radio , Find New Music ” ) = 2 9 .
Figure 6(a ) presents the overall trend of how average ctrA changes when A∗ has different overlap with the corresponding O∗ . What we observed is a non monotonic trend . Neither of the hypotheses we discussed could fully explain the observed data on its own , since both would lead to a monotonic dependency .
To understand this non monotonic trend , we exploit the intuition gained from our analysis in Section 4 : the way ads and organic results are perceived in the context of each other can change dramatically depending on the user ’s information need . Indeed , after dividing the data according to the navigational score ( Figure 6(b ) ) we observed the following dichotomy . For navigational* queries ( ie , queries that are very likely to be navigational ) , ctrA decreases as the overlap increases ( shown in black ) ; that is , the preference for diversity dominates . For non navigational* queries we observe the opposite trend ( shown in green ) : the preference for similarity is salient . Furthermore , as can be seen in Figure 6(c ) , there is a rather smooth transition between these two opposite types of preferences when the likelihood of the considered queries being navigational varies .
5.2 Model
In this section , we describe a simple model that formalizes our observations , in particular , the non monotonic relationship between ctrA and overlap . Let δc denote the event that an ad is clicked , and Ov be its overlap to O∗ , we model the probability of an ad being clicked given Ov : P ( δc|Ov = x ) . Note that what is plotted in Figure 6(a ) is an empirical estimate of this probability5 .
Let QT be the random variable that indicates the type of the query that the ad was shown for : if the query is navigational otherwise
P ( δc , QT = α|Ov = x )
QT = n n
We have :
P ( δc|Ov = x ) = Xα∈{n,n} = Xα∈{n,n}
P ( δc|QT = α , Ov = x)P ( QT = α|Ov = x )
( 1 ) P ( δc|QT = n , Ov = x ) is the probability that an ad is clicked given that the query is navigational and overlap is x . Recall that the black curve in Figure 6(b ) is an empirical estimate of this probability . We observe that it is largely monotonically decreasing with respect to x . For simplicity we approximate it with a linear function
P ( δc|QT = n , Ov = x ) = b1 − c1x with c1 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] , b1 ∈ [ c1 , 1 ] . approximate
Similarly , based on the green curve in Figure 6(b ) , we
P ( δc|QT = n , Ov = x ) = b2 + c2x where c2 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] , b2 ∈ [ 0 , 1 − c2 ] . Next , we consider P ( QT = α|Ov = x ) by examining the trend in our data . Figure 7 shows the fraction of navigational* queries for each overlap value , relative to the set of all navigational* and non navigational* queries . We can observe that this dependency is of a linearly increasing type . Based on this observation we approximate
P ( QT = n|Ov = x ) = b3 + c3x where c3 ∈ ( 0 , 1 ] , b3 ∈ [ 0 , 1 − c3 ] .
Note also that
P ( QT = n|Ov = x ) = 1 − P ( QT = n|Ov = x ) .
Thus , equation ( 1 ) becomes :
P ( δc|Ov = x ) = ( b1 − c1x)(b3 + c3x ) + ( b2 + c2x)(1 − b3 − c3x ) = −Ax2 + Bx + C where
A = c3(c2 + c1 ) B = c3(b1 − b2 ) − b3(c1 + c2 ) + c2

This model formalizes the observations summarized in In particular , since A > 0 , as a Figure 6 and Figure 7 . function of x , P ( δc|Ov = x ) takes its maximum at B 2A . For a wide range of choices of ci and bi , we have 0 ≤ B 2A ≤ 1 , and thus this model explains the bell shaped curve observed in Figure 6(a ) .

5.3 Further investigation
Previously , we discussed how the preference for similarity changes into a preference for diversity , as the users interact with the search engine differently . In particular , for a navigational intent , ads that are similar to the organic results tend to receive lower CTR , whereas the opposite trend is observed for a non navigational intent . This is reflected in the differences between the models for P ( δc|QT = n , Ov = x ) and P ( δc|QT = n , Ov = x ) we proposed in Section 52 In this section , we propose a possible explanation for this dichotomy .
Consider a user who submitted a navigational query like “ pandora radio ” . The desired result is almost always a particular site ( wwwpandoracom in our case ) that would receive the highest CTR among organic results ( ie , O∗ ) . One might expect that the most useful ad would be an ad for “ Pandora Internet Radio ” — after all , this is the result that the user was expecting when she submitted the respective query . However , our findings indicate the opposite : for navigational queries , the ads that are very similar to O∗ tend to receive lower CTR than those that are more different .
To understand the reason behind this seemingly counterintuitive preference , we introduce the notion of responsive and incidental ads . Responsive ads directly address the user ’s information need : a “ Pandora Internet Radio ” ad would be a responsive ad for a navigational query like “ pandora radio ” , or for a non navigational query like “ free online radio ” . Incidental ads do not aim to directly address the user ’s information need . Rather , they are loosely related in that the advertisers expect users who are interested in the query to be also interested in their product . For instance , an ad for “ Discounted Bose Computer Speakers ” would be an incidental ad for both “ pandora radio ” and “ free online radio ” . Indeed , incidental ads would not be considered as reasonable results if presented as organic search results .
Based on the intuition that incidental ads would , in general , not be considered as suitable organic results , we assume that ads that were not similar to the organic results are more likely to be incidental6 . Thus , under this interpretation , our results show that in the case of navigational queries incidental ads are more effective , whereas in the case of a non navigational query , incidental ads tend to receive lower CTR . Recall the non commercial bias we discussed in Section 43 When a user has a navigational intent , a responsive ad would not offer any incentive to overcome this bias , whereas an incidental ad would provide useful information complementary to what was offered by the targeted organic result . More importantly , in the case of navigational queries , the cost of diverting from the original information need is very small : the user could always retrieve the targeted organic result with minimal efforts . In contrast , when the intent of the user is non navigational , this cost would be higher since the goal of the user is not to retrieve a particular known site , but to find out what best satisfy her information need ( for example , the best free online radio ) . As a result , the user would be less willing to interrupt the search for a potentially related need ( eg , a pair of discounted computer speakers ) provided by an incidental ad .
5.4 Predicting relative CTR
In the previous section we examined the interplay between the organic and the sponsored search results at an aggregated level . In this section , we investigate the effects of this interplay at the query level : given a SERPv ( as defined in Section 3 ) , we study whether we can better predict which sponsored search result gets higher clickthrough rate by using the context of the organic search results .
More specifically , we define a prediction task as follows . Let pos(a# ) be the average position in which an ad a# has been shown ( recall that an ad is not necessarily always shown in the same position ) . We say that two ads , a# and a## , are shown at a comparable position if |pos(a# ) − pos(a##)| < 05 For a given query , we identify the most clicked ad A∗ . We then select an ad a shown for the same query at a comparable position that has different CTR , domain and title than A∗ . This pair of ads is then arranged in random order as ( a1 , a2 ) . For each query we consider as many pairs of ads as we could find subject to the above criteria . The prediction task is to see whether we can build a classifier to correctly predict if CT R(a1 ) > CT R(a2 ) .
Our goal is to understand whether by using novel features inspired by our observations above , namely , features that reflect the interaction between the sponsored and organic results , we can achieve better CTR prediction than a system employing only traditional features based on the relation between the query and the content of the ad . The set of the 20 features that we introduce is presented in Table 1 . The first 18 features in the table reflect the similarity of the ads in the pair to the most clicked organic result O∗ ; the last 2 features describe the SERPv from which the respective pair
6One can envision using a more elaborate classifier that distinguishes between these two types of ads to produce more accurate labels . Given the scope of this study , we considered the similarity measure as an approximation and leave the classifier as interesting future work .

We used the Weka7 implementation of the C4.5 decision tree as the classifier . In what follows , we refer to the classifier using only the features described in Table 1 as Org Sim . We compare this classifier against a classifier which ignores the context of the organic results ( Qsim ) , but employs word and phrase features to predict the relevancy of each ad to the query , as described in [ 4 ] .
Table 2 summarizes the performances achieved by these systems on the prediction task . We can see that Org Sim , which uses novel features characterizing the ad organic interaction , outperforms the Qsim system with an improvement in accuracy of almost 2 % . Furthermore , using both types of features in the classifier ( Org Sim + Qsim ) outperformed each system individually . These improvements are all statistically significant ( p < 0.001 according to a paired t test ) . Our results indicate that not only are our proposed features useful for this task , but they also supply complementary information to the conventional feature set .
6 . RELATED WORK
Web search and sponsored search has been an area of active research in the past few years . A few studies have been reported that focus on CTR prediction and analysis of click behavior in sponsored search . Regelson and Fain [ 16 ] analyze sponsored search data by examining the ad CTR based on its position , bid phrase , and bid phrase volume decile . They also show that using clustering of similar bid phrases by features extracted from their text , can improve the CTR prediction compared to other simpler bucketing of bid phrases as for example volume deciles . Richardson et al . [ 17 ] show that features from the ad title , creative , and ad group can further improve the CTR prediction .
In addition to such predictive techniques , Agarwal et al . [ 1 ] report a reactive method for click aggregation on multiple levels of a page and ad taxonomy . While this method has been examined in the context of content match , it can easily be adapted to sponsored search .
Web search click data has also been the focus of examination of the search and information retrieval communities . 7Available at http://wwwcswaikatoacnz/ml/weka/

Two main areas of investigation here have been using clicks for direct improvements in ranking [ 2 , 14 , 13 ] ; and modeling , analysis and prediction of user clicks in web search [ 7 , 5 , 8 ] . To the best of our knowledge , there have been no previous studies that analyzed the interplay between the organic and the sponsored search results in terms of the CTR .
In [ 12 ] Jensen and Resnick report a user study and a survey examining user behavior and perceptions when interacting with the SERP . The first experiment shows that , on average , the users examine the organic results before the ads and that the organic results is perceived as being more relevant and less biased . They also point out that when judging the relevance , the users rely greatly on the titles of the ads and the organic results . While the findings of this study are

7 . CONCLUSIONS
Result pages of major Web search engines routinely include information from multiple sources , where its two most prominent constituents are organic search results and sponsored ads . To the best of our knowledge , no prior study has examined the interaction between these two complementary sources of information , and in this paper we sought to address this issue . Specifically , we used real life click data from a major Web search engine to understand how their competition for user attention can turn into mutual growth of click through rates .
Recent research on query expansion for advertising advocated using Web search results for query augmentation [ 4 ] , essentially assuming that topical similarity between the organic results and the ads is desirable . One of the goals of the present study was to verify this hypothesis , and we ( somewhat unexpectedly ) found that the desired degree of organicto ad similarity depends on the type of query at hand . To explain our observations , we introduced the notions of responsive and incidental ads , which correspond to the narrow and the broad interpretation of the user ’s information need underlying the query .
We believe our findings will allow us to better understand the ways in which different types of queries can be best answered . Our findings also suggest that jointly optimizing the selection of organic and ad results might offer users a more productive Web search experience , as well as enable search engine companies to better monetize this experience .
