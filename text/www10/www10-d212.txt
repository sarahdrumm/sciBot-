ABSTRACT Tag recommendation is a common way to enrich the textual annotation of multimedia contents . However , state of the art recommendation methods are built upon the pair wised tag relevance , which hardly capture the context of the web video , ie , when who are doing what at where . In this paper we propose the contextoriented tag recommendation ( CtextR ) approach , which expands tags for web videos under the context consistent constraint . Given a web video , CtextR first collects the multi form WWW resources describing the same event with the video , which produce an informative and consistent context ; and then , the tag recommendation is conducted based on the obtained context . Experiments on an 80,031 web video collection show CtextR recommends various relevant tags to web videos . Moreover , the enriched tags improve the performance of web video categorization .

INTRODUCTION With the proliferation of web videos available on the WWW , web video tag recommendation – the act of automatically adding relevant tags to web videos – is becoming imperative . As the number of user provided raw tags is limited and they are usually insufficient to characterize the informative web video . Generally , state of the art methods [ 1][2 ] recommend tags using a two step scheme . First , certain kinds of tag relevance ( eg , tag cooccurrence , tag visual relation , etc . ) are mined between each raw tag and potential relevant tag pair ; and then , the obtained tag relevance pairs are fused to determine a list of recommending tags . Although encouraging results are reported on web images ( eg those in [ 1][2] ) , trivially applying the scheme to web videos is cumbersome . For example , Fig 1 gives a video about Pope Bebedict XVI was knocked down by a woman at Christmas mass . By using a method analogous to that in [ 1 ] , the top 5 recommended tags are “ church ” , “ press ” , “ god ” , “ Catholic ” , and “ merry ” , respectively . The five tags are all meaningless to the video . We argue , the above mis recommendation , is attributed to the applied method has not taken into account the context characteris*This work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China ( 973 Program , 2007CB311100 ) , National Nature Science Foundation of China ( 60873165 , 60802028 , 60902090 ) , Beijing New Star Project on Science & Technology ( 2007B071 ) , Co building Program of Beijing Municipal Education Commission .

A web video is generally used to broadcast a dynamic web event , which occurs in a specific context characterized by elements such as who , what , where , when , etc . An isolated raw tag hardly captures such a context , so the tags expanded based on the pair wised tag relevance are not necessarily in accordance with the video event . So for web videos , recommending tags in the video specific event context is essential . But the context consistent resource in datasets of the same form ( eg , YouTube repository ) is limited , which is often insufficient to provide valuable clues for tag expansion . However , the context consistent multi form resources on the web supply us with an opportunity to address this deficiency . In the huge WWW , a same web event is usually covered in many websites in multiple media forms such as videos , news reports , blog articles , etc . For example , the top returned results from Google search include news reports , videos , and user comments from BBS , when using “ Pope Christmas mass ” as the query , as shown in Fig 1 . These resources provide an informative and consistent context for the web event so we call them the same context ( SameCtext ) resources in this paper . Therefore , for a web video , if we can collect its SameCtext resources from the web , then relevant tags can be expanded accordingly ( see Fig 1 and Fig 2 ) . Motivated by the above observations , in this paper we propose the context oriented tag recommendation ( CtextR ) approach to recommend tags for web videos . Given a web video , CtextR focuses on finding its SameCtext resources available on the WWW , and expanding and recommending tags from the textual descriptions contributed by these resources . Experimental results on MCGWEBV [ 3 ] show the CtextR approach expands diverse and relevant tags for web videos , which significantly enrich the completeness of the raw tags . In addition , the enriched tags improve the performance of web video categorization . 2 . THE CTEXTR APPROACH Given a web video , the CtextR approach works as follows . First , a heuristic is employed to construct a query that captures the context of the video . Then , the query is submitted to Google search engine and the SameCtext resources are identified and collected . The textual descriptions of these resources supply an informative and consistent context for the video . Then , a PageRank like graph model is applied on the context to discover and rank the keywords from the resources , where the top but untagged ones are added to the video . The whole flowchart is given in Fig 1 .

Blogs & BBS  2.1 Query Construction Query construction aims at extracting a few keywords from the given video . These keywords characterize the video from several key aspects so they represent the context of the video . We design a heuristic to implement the extraction . First , the part of speech ( POS ) and named entities ( NE ) attributes of the tags and title words are identified , respectively . Then , the Wikipedia longest match criterion is used to determine tag entities . That is , for example , a video tagged with “ Pope , Benedict ” , “ Pope ” and “ Pope Benedict ” are both detected as Wikipedia entities , but only “ Pope Benedict ” is reserved . We assign a tag entity with a certain POS ( NE ) if at least one of its tags belongs to this POS ( NE ) . In the query construction , we give priority to tag entities marked as NE or nouns . To make the query relevant and distinct , each query consists of at least 3 tag entities . For videos containing less than 3 tag entities , the most frequent tag entities in its related videos are added . By this way , query “ Pope , Christmas , mass ” are constructed for the video given in Fig 1 . 2.2 SameCtext Resources Finding We submit the constructed query to Google and collect the top 10 returned results . Among the results , one is regarded as a SameCtext resource if all query tag entities are presented in its Google generated title or abstract . 2.3 Significant Tag Extraction The textual descriptions attached to the SameCtext resources provide an informative and consistent context for the video . Among them , we believe the significant tags are the ones co occurred with the query tag entities in multiple resources , so we employ a graph model to discover them . The textual description of the i th
SameCtext resource is denoted as ( cid:1856 ) , which is obtained by comprocess to ( cid:1856 ) , where the POS filtering and the Wikipedia longest entities are reserved . Then we construct an graph ( cid:1833)(cid:4666)(cid:1848),(cid:1831)(cid:4667 ) , where ( cid:1848 ) is the set of vertices and each vertex is a reserved tag entity , ( cid:1831 ) is the set of edges and its element ( cid:1857 ) , is the relation between tag entities ( cid:1861 ) and designed as ( cid:1857),∑ ( cid:1846)(cid:3031)(cid:3286)(cid:4666)(cid:1861),(cid:4667 ) where ( cid:1830 ) is the textual description collection . If tag entities ( cid:1861 ) and ( cid:3031)(cid:3286)(cid:1488)(cid:3005 ) both appear in ( cid:1856)(cid:3038 ) , then ( cid:1846)(cid:3031)(cid:3286)(cid:4666)(cid:1861),(cid:4667)1 , and ( cid:1846)(cid:3031)(cid:3286)(cid:4666)(cid:1861),(cid:4667)0 otherwise . Based on the obtained graph ( cid:1833 ) , the significant score of each tag entity can be deduced . Denoted by ( cid:3038)(cid:4666)(cid:1861)(cid:4667 ) the significant score of tag entity ( cid:1861 ) at iteration ( cid:1863 ) , the graph model can be formulated as ( cid:1819)(cid:3038)(cid:2009)(cid:1779)(cid:3560)·(cid:1819)(cid:3038)(cid:3397)(cid:4666)(cid:3080)(cid:4667 ) |(cid:1819)| ( cid:1805 ) ( 2 ) where ( cid:1819)(cid:3038)(cid:4670)(cid:3038)(cid:4666)(cid:1861)(cid:4667)(cid:4671)|(cid:1819)|(cid:3400 ) , ( cid:1779)(cid:3560 ) is the row normalized edge matrix , ( cid:1805 ) is a vector with all elements equal to 1 . ( cid:2009 ) is the damping factor set the ( cid:1819)(cid:3038 ) in Eq 2 will converge to ( cid:1819)(cid:3095 ) , the stationary tag entity signif to 0.85 , as in the Google PageRank algorithm . Eq 2 has exactly the same form as the PageRank algorithm . So bining its Google generated title and abstract . Since not all words are good candidates as the tag , we first apply a syntactic filtering match are both employed , only the noun , adjective and verb tag
( 1 ) icant vector , which gives large scores to the tag entities closely linked with many others .

2.4 Tag Recommendation We rank the tag entities in descending order according to their significant scores , which generates an enriched tag list for the web video . In the list , the ones ranked on the top but not in raw tags are treated as the recommended tags and added to the video . 3 . EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We conduct the CtextR approach on MCG WEBV [ 3 ] , a dataset containing 80,031 representative YouTube videos . We construct queries for 79,043 videos , from which 789,598 resources are collected and 461,768 of them are judged as relevant . We heuristically classify the resources into six forms , according to whether certain pieces appear in their hyperlinks . The result is given in Tab . 1 . As shown in Tab . 1 , the queries collect SameCtext resources of multiple media forms , which provide many valuable clues to expand tags for the web videos . Some recommendation examples are given in Fig 2 . From the examples , we can see that the proposed approach recommends various tags to web videos at a relatively low noisy rate . We perform a tag based web video categorization experiment on MCG WEBV to compare the raw tags with the enriched tags . We use the vector space model to build the feature for each video . The raw video category label is used as the ground truth , which assigns each video with one of the 15 YouTube provided categories . Two SVM classifiers are separately trained and predicted on the two tag sets . The MAP of the enriched tags ( 0.569 ) is higher than that of the raw tags ( 0.521 ) , indicating that tag related applications have benefit from the proposed CtextR approach . 4 . CONCLUSION This paper proposes the CtextR approach to do web video tag recommendation . By leveraging multi form WWW resources , CtextR successfully recommends relevant tags to web videos . Experimental results on web video categorization demonstrate the feasibility of the context oriented recommendation idea . In the future , we will incorporate visual features to design a more robust query construction method , which can steadily extract key tag entities no matter how noisy or limited the raw tags are . 5 .
