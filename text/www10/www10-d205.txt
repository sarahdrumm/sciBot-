ABSTRACT With the explosive growth of digital cameras and online media , it has become crucial to design efficient methods that help users browse and search large image collections . The recent VisualRank algorithm [ 4 ] employs visual similarity to represent the link structure in a graph so that the classic PageRank algorithm can be applied to select the most relevant images . However , measuring visual similarity is difficult when there exist diversified semantics in the image collection , and the results from VisualRank cannot supply good visual summarization with diversity . This paper proposes to rank the images in a structural fashion , which aims to discover the diverse structure embedded in photo collections , and rank the images according to their similarity among local neighborhoods instead of across the entire photo collection . We design a novel algorithm named RankCompete , which generalizes the PageRank algorithm for the task of simultaneous ranking and clustering . The experimental results show that RankCompete outperforms VisualRank and provides an efficient but effective tool for organizing web photos .

INTRODUCTION
The popularity of digital cameras , camera phones and high capacity memory cards has led to an explosion of digital images on the web , especially in online photo sharing communities . The common approach used in web image search is based on textual information ( eg , image file name and surrounding text ) . However , such an approach cannot handle images where the related textual information is missing or inconsistent with the visual content . The current image search techniques are also ineffective for browsing the photo albums in the online sharing communities ( eg , Flickr , Facebook ) . When reviewing photos from friends or from the community , users often have to click the images page by page , with many irrelevant images or duplicates .

Jing and Baluja proposed VisualRank [ 4 ] , which identifies the authority of images on a similarity graph based on visual similarity . VisualRank is motivated by the recent success of the PageRank algorithm [ 6 ] . Unlike the classical PageRank and HITS that build an adjacent matrix based on the hyperlinks between web documents , VisualRank treats images as web documents and their similarities as “ visual ” links . Such visual links will not suffer from malicious hyperlinks from web spammers . Based on such visual links , a PageRank score is estimated for each image , based on which images are ordered for retrieval systems .
Despite its success in product image search , VisualRank is still not perfect for tasks such as browsing and organizing large collection of images in several aspects . First , VisualRank does not consider the visual diversity of the retrieval results and cannot handle the ambiguity of user queries . If two images look similar , they will share similar hyperlinks with others . As a result , if an image is ranked high by VisualRank , its duplicate or near duplicate images will also be ranked high , giving the user a subset of images with rather limited visual diversity . Moreover , it is difficult for users to explore the searching results provided by VisualRank due to the lack of structure . A user often have to scroll or click through many pages of image results to find the object of interest .
We propose a new algorithm named RankCompete that generalizes the PageRank algorithm for the task of simultaneous ranking and clustering . Our contribution is a scheme that performs the tasks of ranking and clustering in a mutually enhancing fashion : ( 1 ) the ranking results make more sense when comparing only the images with similar semantics . ( 2 ) the clustering results can also be improved using ranking information since relevant documents are more similar to each other than the irrelevant documents . 2 . ALGORITHM
Following the work in VisualRank [ 4 ] , this work models visual similarity using the matched SIFT features [ 5 ] from a pair of images , which are 128 dimensional vectors describing the image gradient orientation histograms for local patches . Given two images , VisualRank [ 4 ] computes their similarity as the number of local features shared between them . However , computing pairwise similarity is expensive . To accelerate the computation , we quantize SIFT descriptors into salient visual words and compute the image similarity as the number of shared visual words between the two images . Thus the images form a graph where the column normalized similarity matrix S corresponds to an adjacency matrix .
To make the presentation simple , we first consider the
Algorithm 1 : The RankCompete Algorithm
1 : Initialize p1 and p2 satisfying P u pk(u ) = 1 for k = 1 , 2 .
2 : Update until convergence 3 : 4 : 5 : Obtain two clusters D1 and D2 with the corresponding nor do ranking step using ( 1 ) do competing step using ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . malization factors ρ1 and ρ2 . 6 : if ρk > T hreshold , k = {1 , 2} 7 : 8 : Output all clusters with corresponding ranking scores . do RankCompete on subgraph Dk two class clustering and introduce two groups of two random walks in the similarity graph . We define two measures p1 and p2 to represent the probability for each random walk to visit each image node u with the constraint Pu pk(u ) =
1 , k = {1 , 2} . We also assume that one node can only host one walk , so that p1 and p2 will compete with each other on every node .
The RankCompete algorithm can be viewed as a two step process . In the ranking step , we update pk in a way similar to PageRank : pk = S∗pk
( 1 )
Then in the competing step , two random walks p1 and p2 will compete on each node by pk(u ) = fl pk(u ) ,
0 , if pk(u ) = maxk′ pk′ ( u ) otherwise
( 2 )
To guarantee that p1 and p2 satisfy the constraint of random walk , we use a normalization process of pk(u ) = pk(u)/ρk
( 3 ) where ρk = Pu pk(u ) is called a normalization factor .
RankCompete initializes p1 and p2 by two random vectors or from two selected images , and then iteratively update them based on Eqs . ( 1)(2 ) ( 3 ) until p1 and p2 no longer change or iterations exceed a threshold ( 50 in our experiment)1 . Based on p1 , p2 , we can obtain two clusters D1 and D2.The ranking score of each node u is also obtained simultaneously as p1(u ) or p2(u ) . Note that RankCompete can be easily generalized to multiple class clustering by performing hierarchical clustering in a top down manner . Algorithm 2 outlines the procedure of general random compete algorithm . More details can be found in [ 2 ] . 3 . EXPERIMENTS
We first use an example to show how our RankCompete algorithm produces a structured view of the search results . We download images from Flickr using the query of “ Raleigh ” and apply the RankCompete algorithm to these images . The top three clusters in Figure 1 show that our algorithm can effectively summarize the diversified images and help find the most relevant images more effectively .
To further evaluate our algorithm , we employ two public datasets to compare the performance of VisualRank and RankCompete . We first employ the dataset from ImageCLEF’08 [ 1 ] , which provides labels for 39 topics and each topic is composed with multiple clusters ( 2 ∼ 23 ) . Our use of the dataset is different from the original intention since we are not working on the annotation such as titles , descriptions , and locations . In contrast , we fuse the ground
1It can be proven that the converged pk coincides with the PageRank score in the sub graph within the cluster [ 2 ] .

Average Precision Average S Recall

0.578 0.612 truth images of each topic with 40 % randomly selected other images . To evaluate our algorithm , we compare the top 20 images returned by VisualRank and RankCompete algorithms for each topic . The second dataset comes from the WIDE Data set [ 3 ] , which is the largest labeled visual dataset available at present . For each topic , we collect 1000 images with ground truth concepts or with the same tags . For each topic , we evaluate the top 50 images returned by VisualRank and RankCompete algorithms . To evaluate the performance , we employ two measures : precision ( the percentage of relevant images in the retrieved list ) and S recall ( the percentage of different clusters found by the ranking algorithms ) . Table 1 compares the average precision and S recalls across 39 topics on the ImageCLEF dataset . Our method can improve both the accuracy and diversity of the retrieval results . Since there are no cluster tags associated with each topic in NUS WIDE , we can only compare the precision but not S recall . Our RankCompete algorithm again outperforms VisualRank ( precision 0.894 vs . 0872 ) 4 . CONCLUSION
We present a new algorithm named RankCompete , which is a generalization of the PageRank algorithm to the scenario of simultaneous ranking and clustering . The results shows that RankCompete works well for the task of simultaneous ranking and clustering of web photos , and outperforms VisualRank on two challenging datasets . 5 . ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
