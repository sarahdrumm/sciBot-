ABSTRACT
With the phenomenal success of networking sites ( eg , Facebook , Twitter and LinkedIn ) , social networks have drawn substantial attention . On online social networking sites , link recommendation is a critical task that not only helps improve user experience but also plays an essential role in network growth . In this paper we propose several link recommendation criteria , based on both user attributes and graph structure . To discover the candidates that satisfy these criteria , link relevance is estimated using a random walk algorithm on an augmented social graph with both attribute and structure information . The global and local influence of the attributes is leveraged in the framework as well . Besides link recommendation , our framework can also rank attributes in a social network . Experiments on DBLP and IMDB data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms state of the art methods based on network structure and node attribute information for link recommendation .

INTRODUCTION
Social networking sites , such as Facebook , Twitter , and LinkedIn , are increasingly popular . Facebook reports that it has 300 million active users , 50 % of whom login every day on average . Worldwide , more than 8 billion minutes are spent on Facebook per day . They use the social network sites not only to maintain contacts with old friends , but also to find new friends with similar interests and for business networking . It is reported that an average user has 130 friends on Facebook . Since the linkage among people is the underlying key concept for online social network sites , it is not surprising that link recommendation is an essential link mining task [ 1 ] .
In this paper , we propose a framework using both attribute and structural properties to recommend potential linkages in social networks . To compute accurate link recommendations in social networks , we propose a list of desired criteria . A random walk framework on an augmented social graph using both attribute and structural properties is further proposed , which satisfies all the criteria .

We also discuss different methods for setting edge weights in the augmented social graph which considers both global and local characteristics of the attributes . The experiments on two real data sets show that our methods outperform the state of the art methods .
2 . PROBLEM FORMULATION
Given a social graph G(V , E ) , where V is the set of nodes and E the set of edges , each node in V represents a person in the network , and each edge in E represents a link between two person nodes . Besides the links , each person has his/her own attributes .
The link recommendation task can be expressed as follows : Given node v in V , provide a ranked list of nodes in V other than the existing linked nodes of v as the potential links ranked by link relevance . The following presents some intuition based desiderata for link relevance : ( 1 ) homophily : two persons who share more attributes are more likely to be linked than those who share fewer attributes ; ( 2 ) rarity : the rare attributes are likely to be more important , whereas the common attributes are less important ; ( 3 ) social influence : the attributes shared by a large percentage of friends of a particular person are important for predicting potential links for that person ; ( 4 ) common friendship : the more friends two persons share , the more likely they are to be linked together ; ( 5 ) social closeness : the potential friends are likely to be located close to each other in the social graph ; and ( 6 ) preferential attachment : a person is more likely to link to a popular person rather than to a person with few friends .
A good link candidate should satisfy the above criteria in social networks . In other words , the link relevance should be estimated by considering these intuitive rules .
3 . LINKREC FRAMEWORK
In order to recommend potential links , we augment the original social graph with attribute nodes . To discover link candidates based on the criteria in Section 2 , we design a random walk based algorithm on the augmented graph and use it to compute the link relevance . For each given person node , we rank all the candidates by link relevance , and suggest the top few for link recommendation . Given the original social graph G(V , E ) , we construct a new augmented graph G0(V 0 , E 0 ) . Specifically , for each node in graph G , we create a corresponding node in G0 , called person node . For each edge in E in graph G , we create a corresponding edge in G0 . For each attribute a , we create an additional node in G0 , called attribute node . For every attribute of a person , we create a corresponding edge between the person node and the attribute node . The edge weights from attribute nodes to person nodes are defined in a uniform way . The edges starting from person nodes can point to either person nodes or attribute nodes ; parameter λ controls the tradeoff of the weights between these two types . The larger the λ is , the more the algorithm uses attribute properties for link recommendation . For the edges from person nodes to attribute nodes , we have several weighting options : ( 1 ) weight all the attributes equally for each person ; ( 2 ) attach more weight to the more globally important attributes , where the global importance of attribute measures the percentage of existing links among all the possible person pairs with that attribute ; ( 3 ) attach more weight to the more locally important attributes , ie , the more the number of friends that share the attribute , the more important the attribute is for the person ; and ( 4 ) mix global and local importance together by linear interpolation or multiplication .
In order to calculate the link relevance based on these criteria , we propose a random walk based algorithm on the newly constructed graph to simulate the friendship hunting behavior . We calculate the link relevance with regard to a particular person by using random walk with restart [ 3 ] . Random walk process on the newly constructed graph satisfies the desiderata for link relevance in the following ways : ( 1 ) homophily : if two persons share more attributes , it is more likely to walk from one person to the other ; ( 2 ) rarity : if one attribute is rare , there are fewer outlinks for the corresponding attribute node , because the weight of each outlink is larger , so the probability of a random walk originating from a person via this attribute node is larger ; ( 3 ) social influence : if one attribute is shared by many of the existing linked persons of the given person , the random walk is more likely to pass through the existing linked person nodes to this attribute node ; ( 4 ) common friendship : if two persons share many friends , it is more likely to walk from one person to the other ; ( 5 ) social closeness : if two persons are close to each other in the graph , the random walk probability from one to the other is likely to be larger than if they are far away from each other ; and ( 6 ) preferential attachment : if a person is very popular , there are many inlinks to the person node in the graph , and for a random person node in the graph , it is easier to access a node with more inlinks .
Besides link recommendation , we can rank attributes with respect to a specific person by using the proposed framework . Attribute ranking can have many potential applications . For example , advertisements can be targeted more accurately if we know a person ’s interests more precisely . In the augmented graph , all the nodes including the attribute nodes have the random walk probability , so we can rank attribute nodes based on the random walk probability . The attributes with high ranks in our framework are those that can be easily accessed by not just the given person but also the existing friends and the potential friends .
Besides link recommendation for a single person , we can also recommend links for a community by restarting the random walk from nodes belongs to one community instead of a single one . Similarly , we can also rank the attributes for a cluster of person nodes .
4 . EXPERIMENTS
We conduct our experiments on two real data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework . For DBLP1 , we use the authors in the W W W conferences from 2001 to 2008 as persons and terms in their paper titles as attributes . Each person has ∼93 attributes and ∼7 links on average . Co authorship prediction is considered as link recommendation problem for DBLP . For IMDB2 , we take all the actors/actresses who have performed in more than 10 movies since 2005 and consider movie locations as their attributes . There are 6750 persons and 9851 attributes . Each person has ∼29 attributes and ∼97 links on average . Co staring prediction is considered as link recommendation problem for IMDB .
In order to test and compare different methods , we remove some edges in the graph and recommend the links based on the pruned graph . Four fold cross validation is used . To test the results quanti

Precision , recall and mean reciprocal rank ( MRR ) are reported in Tables 1 and 2 . LINKREC is compared with other methods based on the attribute and structure . SimAttr is to recommend links using attribute similarity . CommonNeighbors , Jaccard , Adamic/Adar and Katz are methods based on graph structure in [ 2 ] . SVM refers to Support Vector Machine on the combination of attribute and structure features . LINKREC(G ) , LINKREC(L ) and LINKREC(M ) denote the variants of our methods using global , local attribute weighting and mixed weighting schema . Our methods outperform all the baseline methods consistently in all the measures . Among the variants of our method , LINKREC(M ) has the best precision , whereas the basic LINKREC performs the best in recall .
For the parameter setting in our framework , we obtain the best values by performing a grid search over ranges of values for these parameters and measuring accuracy on the validation set . λ controls the tradeoff between attribute and structural properties . Optimal λ is achieved at 0.6 in DBLP and 0.2 in IMDB , and the combination of attribute and structural features is much better than using attribute or structure properties individually . For the restart probability of random walks , it is interesting to find that a larger one is preferred and we set it as 0.9 in LINKREC . In other applications such as personalized search and query suggestion , random walks are used to discover relevant entities spread out in the entire graph , so a small restart probability is favorable in these cases . However , in link recommendation , we are more focused on the local neighborhood information , so a larger value is preferred . 5 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we proposed a framework for link recommendation based on attribute and structural properties in social networks . We presented several desired criteria for link recommendation and proposed a random walk algorithm on an augmented graph with both user attribute and graph structure to satisfy those criteria . 6 .
