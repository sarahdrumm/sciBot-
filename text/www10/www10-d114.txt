ABSTRACT Suppose you buy a new laptop and , simply because you like it so much , you recommend it to friends , encouraging them to purchase it as well . What would be an adequate price for the vendor of the laptop to pay for your recommendation ? Personal recommendations like this are of considerable commercial interest , but unlike in sponsored search auctions there can be no truthful prices . Despite this “ lack of truthfulness ” the vendor of the product might still decide to pay you for recommendation eg because she wants to ( i ) provide you with an additional incentive to actually recommend her or to ( ii ) increase your satisfaction and/or brand loyalty . This leads us to investigate a pricing scheme based on the Shapley value [ 5 ] that satisfies certain “ axioms of fairness ” . We find that it is vulnerable to manipulations and show how to overcome these difficulties using the anonymity proof Shapley value of [ 4 ] .

INTRODUCTION & RELATED WORK
Personal recommendation , or “ word of mouth ” , is recognized as a highly effective marketing tool [ 2 ] . But despite its relevance the problem of determining the worth of a recommendation , and hence a “ right ” price for it has not been tackled yet . We present a simple model and show that ( i ) there can be no truthful pricing scheme unless the prices are all zero . We then ( ii ) use the Shapley value [ 5 ] to compute provably “ fair ” prices , but also find that ( iii ) these prices are vulnerable to manipulations unless we base our computations on the anonymity proof Shapley value [ 4 ] .
The work that is most closely related to our paper is [ 1 ] . There the authors study the sales price of an object as part of a viral marketing campaign , but they do not consider ∗This work was conducted as part of a EURYI scheme award . See http://wwwesforg/euryi/ for details .

In fact , they mention the problem of finding optimal “ cashbacks ” in settings where the nodes behave strategically as an open problem . It should be clear that we are not addressing the problem of what to recommend , a problem typically encountered by stores such as Amazon and usually solved using “ collaborative filtering ” techniques [ 3 ] . 2 . A CLASSIFICATION SCHEME
To highlight the differences between different advertising schemes we present a simple classification scheme :
• Addressing : Personal vs . general . • Trust : High vs . low . • Intention : Altruistic vs . commercial . To demonstrate the general applicability of this scheme , we use it to classify a number of different advertising scenarios : A ( 1 ) billboard campaign , eg for a chain of pizza restaurants , is not targeted , has low trust , and a commercial background . A web search engine showing ( 2 ) sponsored search results along with “ organic ” search results uses personal addressing , has low trust , and commercial intentions . If you write a ( 3 ) testimonial on Amazon to convince other customers to buy a book that you liked , then the addressing is general , the trust is high , and the intention is altruistic . If a friend asks you for advice on which laptop to buy and you ( 4 ) recommend the model which you believe is best for her , then this is personal , highly trusted , and altruistic .

3 . THE COOPERATIVE MODEL
We model the pricing problem as a coalitional game with transferable payoff hN , vi , where N is a finite set ( the set of players ) and v is a function that associates with every nonempty subset S of N ( a coalition ) a real number v(S ) ( the worth of S ) . We use s to denote the seller , who is paying for

We assume that neither the product nor the buyer belong to the set N , but we implicitly model the buyer ’s influence on the worth of a coalition by the purchase probability . For each coalition S the number v(S ) is the total payoff that is available for division among the members of S . We use δ ≥ 0 to denote the seller ’s margin or gain from selling the product , ie the sales price minus the production cost . We distinguish two scenarios for v : • Linear . Without any recommendation the product is sold with probability p ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . The recommendation of the ith recommender increases this probability by qi ∈ [ 0 , 1 − Pj6=i qj ] . If the recommenders R ⊆ {r1 , , rn} recommend the product , then the probability is p + Pi:ri∈R qi .
• Threshold . If less than k recommenders recommend the product , then the product is sold with probability p ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] . If at least k recommenders recommend the product , then it is sold with probability p + q where q ∈ [ 0 , 1 − p ] . We refer to these scenarios as hN , vi ( Linear ) and hN , vi ( Threshold ) . Our goal is to find a “ fair ” payoff vector x = ( xs , xr1 , . . . xrn ) , where xs denotes the expected payoff to the seller and xri denotes the expected payoff to the i th recommender , ie the amount she is paid by the seller . Since such a payoff vector gives only expected payoffs , it can be translated into a pricing scheme in two ways : 1 . Pay per Recommendation : The recommender gets paid by the seller for every recommendation ; successful or not . That is , on every recommendation the seller s pays the i th recommender ri the money equivalent of xri .
2 . Pay per Sale : The recommender gets paid by the seller for successful recommendations only . That is , on every successful recommendation the seller s pays the i th recommender ri the money equivalent of xri /(p+f ( {s}∪R) ) , where R is the set of recommenders .
In practice , the Pay per Sale approach might be preferable as , on a successful recommendation , one could reasonably assume p + f ( {s} ∪ R ) = 1 , sidestepping the problem of estimating f ( {s} ∪ R ) with very little or no data . Note that the prior probability p is easier to estimate using the seller ’s sales record and click through or conversion rates . 4 . TRUTHFULNESS & FAIR PRICES
A payoff vector x is truthful wrt the seller s , who holds the private information on p , f , and δ , if it gives her the incentive to reveal her information truthfully . Our first result is that any truthful payoff vector must have Pi xri = 0 , ie , none of the recommenders gets paid . Intuitively , this is because the seller can always pretend to have benefited less from the recommendations then she actually did .
Theorem 1 . There can be no truthful payoff vector x =
( xs , xr1 , . . . , xrn ) that has Pi xri 6= 0 . To ensure high market share and long term revenue it might still be beneficial for the seller to pay a “ fair ” price . The Shapley value is the unique value satisfying a certain number of “ axioms of fairness ” [ 5 ] . It is defined as follows : φi(v ) = PS⊆N\{i}(|S|!(|N | − 1 − |S|)!)/(|N |! ) · ( v(S ∪ {i} ) − v(S) ) . Applying it to our model yields our second result .
Theorem 2 . The Shapley value for the games ( a ) hN , vi
( Linear ) and ( b ) hN , vi ( Threshold ) is given by
( n+1)! qδ .
2 qiδ , and
2 Pi qiδ and φri ( v ) = 1
( a ) φs(v ) = pδ + 1 ( b ) φs(v ) = pδ+ “ 1 − n k!(n−k)!
( n+1)! ” qδ and φri ( v ) = k!(n−k)! Thus , according to the Shapley value , each individual recommender in the game hN , vi ( Linear ) should receive a share of exactly one half of her contribution to the expected “ extra profit ” of the recommender . In the game hN , vi ( Threshold ) the fraction k!(n−k)!/(n+1)! is exactly the fraction of times where this recommender ’s recommendation “ makes a difference ” . These payoffs are fair in the sense that the payoff to each recommender is proportional to the recommender ’s contribution to the “ extra profit ” the seller can expect . 5 . AN ISSUE & A WAY OUT
What would be a “ fair ” payoff vector if each recommendation was a collection of arguments ? A straightforward approach would be to compute the Shapley value on the basis of arguments and to redeem recommender ri with Pa∈Si φa(v ) , where a is an argument from the set of arguments A and Si is the set of arguments that recommender ri possesses . The problem with this approach , however , is that it might be beneficial for a recommender to withhold some of her arguments : • Example 1 . Let A = {a , b , c} , v({a , b} ) = v({a , c} ) = v({a , b , c} ) = 1 , and v({a} ) = v({b} ) = v({c} ) = v({b , c} ) = 0 . Let S1 = {a} and S2 = {b , c} . Then r1 gets φa(v ) = 1 2 and r2 gets φb(v ) + φc(v ) = 1
6 + 1
6 = 1 3 .
2 , r2 gets φb(v ) = 1
• Example 2 . Let A′ = {a , b} , v({a , b} ) = 1 , and v({a} ) = v({b} ) = 0 . Let S1 = {a} and S2 = {b} . Then r1 gets φa(v ) = 1 2 , and r2 would be better off . The anonymity proof Shapley value [ 4 ] cannot be “ tricked ” It is defined as follows : For any set A′ ⊆ A in this way . of declared arguments the anonymity proof Shapley value ψa(v ) for a ∈ A′ is : ψa(v ) = ( φa(v))/(Pa′∈A′ φa′ ( v))v(A′ ) . And so it would be better to ( i ) compute the value ψa(v ) for each argument a ∈ A′ and to ( ii ) give each recommender Pa∈Si ψa(v ) . With this approach r1 and r2 would get ψa = 3/5 and ψb(v ) + ψc(v ) = 2/5 in Example 1 and ψa = 3/4 and ψb(v ) = 1/4 < 2/5 in Example 2 . 6 . FUTURE WORK
An interesting direction for future work would be to analyze the effect of pricing mechanisms such as the ones discussed here on the strategic behavior of recommenders .
