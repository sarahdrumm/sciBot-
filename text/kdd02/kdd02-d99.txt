ABSTRACT
Understanding and learning the subjective aspect of humans in Content Based Image Retrieval has been an active research field during the past few years . However , how to effectively discover users’ concept patterns when there are multiple visual features existing in the retrieval system still remains a big issue . In this paper , we propose a multimedia data mining framework that incorporates Multiple Instance Learning into the user relevance feedback in a seamless way to discover the concept patterns of users , especially where the user ’s most interested region and how to map the local feature vector of that region to the high level concept pattern of users . This underlying mapping can be progressively discovered through the feedback and learning procedure .

1 . INTRODUCTION
Recently , many efforts have been made to Content Based Image Retrieval ( CBIR ) in order to personalize the retrieval engine . The subjectivity of human perception of visual content plays an important role in the CBIR systems . It is very often that the retrieval results are not very satisfactory especially when the level of satisfaction is closely related to user ’s subjectivity . For example , given a query image with a tiger lying on the grass , one user may want to retrieve those images with the tiger objects in them , while another user may find the green grass background more interesting . User subjectivity in image retrieval is a very complex issue and difficult to explain . Therefore , a CBIR system needs to have the capability to discover the users’ concept patterns and adapt to them .
In this paper , we propose a multimedia data mining framework that can dynamically discovering the concept patterns of a specific user to allow the retrieval of images by the user ’s most interested region . The discovering and adapting process aims to find out the mapping between the local low level features of the images and the concept patterns of the user with respect to how he/she feels about the images . The proposed multimedia data mining framework seamlessly integrates several data mining techniques . First , it takes advantages of the user feedback during the retrieval process . The users interact with the system by choosing the positive and negative samples from the retrieved images based on their own concepts . The user feedback is then fed into the retrieval system and triggers the modification of the query criteria to best match the users’ concepts [ 14 ] . Second , in order to identify the user ’s most interested region within the image , the Multiple Instance Learning [ 16 , 18 ] and neural network techniques are integrated into the query refining process . The Multiple Instance Learning technique is originally used in categorization of molecules in the context of drug design . Each molecule is represented by a bag of possible conformations ( instances ) . In image retrieval , each image is viewed as a bag of image regions ( instances ) . In fact , the user feedback guides the system mining through the positive and negative examples , and tells the system to shift its focus of attention to the region of interest . Compared with other Multiple Instance Learning methods used in CBIR , our methodology has the following advantages : 1 ) Instead of manually dividing each picture into many overlapping regions [ 16 ] , we adopt the image segmentation method in [ 5 ] to partition the images in a more natural way ; 2 ) In
( bag ) other Multiple Instance Learning based image retrieval systems such as [ 18 ] , the users are usually asked to provide the positive and negative samples by looking through a huge amount of images in the database . While in our framework , user feedback is used in the image retrieval process , which makes the process more efficient and precise . It is more efficient since it is easy for the user to find some positive samples among the initial retrieved results . It is more precise since among the retrieved images , the user can select the negative samples based on his/her subjective perception . The reason is that the selected negative ones have similar features/contents with the query image but they have different focuses of attention from the user ’s point of view . By selecting them as negative samples , the system can better distinguish the real needs of the users from the “ noisy ” or unrelated information via Multiple Instance Learning . As a result , the system can discover which feature vector related to a region in each image best represents the user's concept , and furthermore , it can determines which dimensions of the feature vector are important by adaptively reweighing them through the neural network technique .
This paper is organized as follows . Section 2 briefly introduces the related work in Relevance Feedback and Multiple Instance Learning . Section 3 introduces the details of the Multiple Instance Learning and neural network techniques used in our framework . The proposed multimedia data mining framework for content based image retrieval using user feedback and Multiple Instance Learning is described in Section 4 . The experimental results are analyzed in Section 5 . Section 6 gives the conclusion and future work .
2 . RELATED WORK
2.1 Retrieval Using Relevance Feedback While lots of research efforts establish the base of CBIR , most of them relatively ignore two distinct characteristics of the CBIR systems : ( 1 ) the gap between high level concepts and low level features , and ( 2 ) the subjectivity of human perception of visual content . To overcome these shortcomings , the concept of relevance feedback ( RF ) associated with CBIR was proposed in [ 13 ] . Relevance feedback is an interactive process in which the user judges the quality of the retrieval performed by the system by marking those images that the user perceives as truly relevant among the images retrieved by the system . This information is then used to refine the original query . This process iterates until a satisfactory result is obtained for the user .
In the past few years , the RF approach to image retrieval has been an active research field . This powerful technique has been proved successful in many application areas . Various ad hoc parameter estimation techniques have been proposed for the RF approaches . The method of RF is based on the most popular vector model [ 4 ] used in information retrieval . The RF techniques do not require a user to provide accurate initial queries , but rather estimate the user ’s ideal query by using positive and negative examples ( training samples ) provided by the user . The fundamental goal of these techniques is to estimate the ideal query parameters ( both the query vectors and the associated weights ) accurately and robustly . Most of the previous RF researches [ 1][6 ] are based on the low level image features such as color , texture and shape and can be classified into two approaches : query point movement and re weighting techniques [ 8 ] . More recently , the new trend towards taking advantages of the semantic contents of the images in addition to the low level features has appeared .
2.2 Multiple Instance Learning Dietterich et al . [ 7 ] introduced the Multiple Instance Learning problem and presented Multiple Instance Learning algorithms for learning axis parallel rectangles ( APR ) . In [ 3 ] , Auer et al . proposed MULTIINST algorithm for Multiple Instance Learning that is also an APR based method . In [ 10 ] , Maron et al . introduced the concept of Diversity Density and applied a two step gradient ascent with multiple starting points to find the maximum Diversity Density . Based on the Diversity Density , Qi Zhang et al . [ 17 ] proposed EM DD algorithm . In their algorithm , it was assumed that each bag has a representative instance and treated it as a missed value , and ( ExpectationMaximization ) method and Quasi Newton method were used to learn the representative instances and maximize the Diversity Density simultaneously . [ 12 ] also used the EM method to do Multiple Instance Regression . Jun Wang et al . [ 15 ] explored the lazy learning approaches in Multiple Instance Learning . They developed two kNNbased algorithms : Citation kNN and Bayesian kNN . In [ 19 ] , Jean Daniel Zucker et al . tried to solve the Multiple Instance Learning problem with decision trees and decision rules . Jan Ramon et al . [ 11 ] proposed the Multiple Instance Neural Network . Stuart Andrews et al . [ 2 ] utilized the Support Vector Machine in Multiple Instance Learning . the EM then
In this paper , one of the main goals is to map the original visual feature space into a space that better describes the user desired high level concepts . In other words , we try to discover the specific concept patterns for an individual user via user feedback and Multiple Instance Learning . In our method , we assume the user searches for those images close to the query image and responds to a series of machine queries by declaring the positive and negative sample images among the displayed images . Efficiency can be measured by the average number of queries necessary to locate the desired images . For this purpose , we introduce a multiple instance feedback model that accounts for various concepts/responses of the user . Each new query is chosen to achieve the user expectation more closely given the previous user responses . Compared with the traditional RF techniques , our method differs in the following two aspects :
1 .
2 .
It is based on such an assumption that the users are usually more interested in one specific region ( blob object ) than other regions of the query image . However , to our best knowledge , the recent efforts in the RF techniques are based on the global image properties of the query image . In order to produce a higher precision , we use the segmentation method proposed in [ 5 ] to segment an image into regions ( segments ) that roughly correspond to objects , which provides the possibility for the retrieval system to discover the most interested region for a specific user based on his feedback .
In many cases , what the user is really interested in is just a region ( an object ) of the query image ( example ) . However , the user ’s feedback is on the whole image . How to effectively identify the user ’s most interested region ( object ) and to precisely capture the user ’s high level concepts based on his/her feedback on the whole image have not received much attention yet . In this paper , we apply Multiple Instance Learning method to discover the user ’s interested region and then mine the user ’s high level concepts . By doing so , not only the region of interest can be discovered , but also the ideal query point of that query image can be approached within several iterations . labels which are Positive and Negative respectively . A bag is labeled Positive if the bag has one or more than one Positive instance and is labeled negative if and only if all its instances are Negative . The Multiple Instance Learning problem is to learn a function mapping from an instance to a label ( either Positive or Negative ) with the best approximation the unknown real mapping function , which can be defined as follows : to

Hence , the relationship between the functions f and MIL can be described in Figure 1 .

3 . THE PROPOSED MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING FRAMEWORK
In a traditional supervised learning scenario , each object in the training set has a label associated with it . The supervised learning can be viewed as a search for a function that maps an object to its label with the best approximation to the real unknown mapping function , which can be described with the following :

Unlike the traditional supervised learning , in multiple instance learning , the label of an individual object is unknown . Instead , only the label of a set of objects is available . An individual object is called an instance and a set of instances with an associated label is called a bag . Specifically , in image retrieval there are only two kinds of

3.4 Multiple Instance Learning to Traditional Supervised Learning Similar to the analysis on Multiple Instance Learning problem in Section 3.1 , the traditional supervised learning problem can also be converted to an unconstrained optimization problem as shown in Equation ( 9 ) .

Notice that Equation ( 10 ) is the same as the right side of Equation ( 7 ) , and Equation ( 11 ) is the same as the right iO in Equations ( 10 ) and side of Equation ( 8 ) except that ( 11 ) represents an object while in Equations ( 7 ) and isI ( 8 ) represents an instance with the maximum label in bag iB . This similarity provides us an easy way to transform Multiple Instance Learning to the traditional supervised learning .
The steps of transformation are as follows :
1 . For each bag
( iBi
,1 L=
)n
, in the training set , calculate the label of each instance ijI belonging to it .
2 . Select the instance with maximum label in each bag iB . Let denote the instance with the maximum isI label in bag iB .
( 3 . Construct a set of objects iOi }{ . instances isI where
IO = is i

4 . For each object iO , construct a label iLo that is actually the label of bag iB .
5 . The Multiple Instance Learning problem with the traditional input the the learning problem with is converted to
{ }{ }i input i L B , supervised { }{ }i . i Lo O ,
After this transformation , the gradient based search methods used in the traditional supervise learning such as the steepest descent method can be applied to Multiple Instance Learning .
Despite the above transformation from Multiple Instance Learning to the traditional supervised learning , there still exists a major difference between Multiple Instance Learning and traditional supervised learning . In the traditional supervised learning , the training set is static and usually does not change during learning procedure . However , in the transformed version of Multiple Instance Learning , the training set may change the during the learning procedure . The reason is that the instance with the maximum label in each bag may change with the update of the approximated function fˆ during the learning procedure and therefore the training set constructed along with the aforementioned transformation may change during the learning procedure . In spite of such a dynamic characteristic of the training set , the fundamental learning method remains the same . The following is the pseudo code describing our Multiple Instance Learning framework . MIL( Input : set . L = bag

/* The stop criterion can be based on MSE or the number of iterations . */ 3 Transform Multiple Instance Learning to traditional supervised learning using the method described in this section .
4 Apply the gradient based search method in traditional supervised learning to update the parameters in γ .
5 Go to Step 2 .
Obviously , the convergence of our Multiple Instance Learning framework depends on what kind of gradientbased search method is applied at Step 4 . Actually , it has the same convergence property as the gradient based search method applied
4 . IMAGE RETRIEVAL USING RELEVANCE FEEDBACK AND MULTIPLE INSTANCE LEARNING
In a CBIR system , the most common way is ‘Query byExample’ which means the user submits a query example ( image ) and the CBIR system retrieves the images that are most similar to the query image from the image database . However , in many cases , when a user submits a query image , what the user really interested in is just a region of the image . The image retrieval system proposed by [ 5 ] first segments each image into a couple of regions , and then allows the user to specify the region of interest on the segmented query image . Unlike the Blobworld system , we use the user ’s feedback and Multiple Instance Learning to automatically capture the user interested region during the query refining process . Another advantage of our method is that the underlying mapping between the local visual feature vector of that region and the user ’s high level concept can be progressively discovered through the feedback and learning procedure .
In [ 18 ] , Multiple Instance Learning is applied on CBIR . As a necessary step before actual image retrieval , the user has to first submit a set of images as the training examples that are used to learn the user ’s target concept . However , it is usually difficult for the user to provide such a training set . In our method , the first set of training examples are obtained from the user ’s feedback on the initial retrieval results . In addition , the user ’s target concept is refined iteratively during the interactive retrieval process .

It is assumed that user is only interested in one region of an image . In other words , there exists a function that can roughly map a region of an image f to the user ’s concept . S denotes the image feature vector } space of the regions and
( Negative ) where Positive means that the feature vector representing this region meets the user ’s concept and Negative means not . An image is Positive if there exists one or more regions in the image that can meet the user ’s concept . An image is Negative if none of the regions can meet the user ’s concept . Therefore , an image can be viewed as a bag and its regions are the instances of the bag in Multiple Instance Learning scenario . During the image retrieval procedure , the user ’s feedback can provide the labels ( Positive or Negative ) for the retrieved images and the labels are assigned to the individual images , not on individual regions . Thus , the image retrieval task can be viewed as a Multiple Instance Learning task aiming to f and thus to mine the discover the mapping function user ’s high level concept from the low level features . image , and there are no
At the beginning of retrieval , the user only submits a query training examples available , which means the learning method is not applicable at the current stage . Hence , we use the following metric to measure the similarity of two images . Assume Image A consists of n regions and Image B consists of m regions , and ie , , where iA is a region of Image A and B = jB is a region of Image B . The distance ( difference ) between Images A and B is defined as :

Upon the first round of retrieving those “ most similar ” images , according to Equation ( 12 ) , the users can give their feedbacks by labeling each retrieved image as Positive or Negative . Based on the user feedbacks , a set of training examples { can be constructed where +B consists of all the Positive bags ( ie , the images the −B consists of all the user assigns Positive labels ) and Negative bags ( ie , the images the user assigns Negative , our labels ) .

The feedback and learning are performed iteratively . Moreover , during the feedback and learning process , the capturing of user ’s high level concept is refined until the user satisfies . At that time , the query process can be terminated by the user .
5 . EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS this section ,
In experimental results are presented . the experimental setup and the
5.1 Image Repository We created our own image repository using images from the Corel image library . There are 2,500 images collected from various categories for our testing purpose .
5.2 Image Processing Techniques To apply Multiple Instance Learning on mining users’ concept patterns , we assume that the user is only interested in a specific region of the query image . Therefore , we first need to perform image segmentation . The automatic segmentation method proposed in the Blobworld system [ 5 ] is used in our system . The joint distribution of the color , texture and location features is modeled using a mixture of Gaussian . The ExpectationMaximization ( EM ) method is used to estimate the parameters of the Gaussian Mixture model and Minimum Description Length ( MDL ) principle is used to select the best number of components in Gaussian Mixture model . The color , texture , shape and location characteristics of each region are extracted after image segmentation . Thus , each region is represented by a low level feature vector . In our experiments , we used three texture features , three color the representation of an image segment . Therefore , for each features and features as shape two bag ( image ) , the number of its instances ( regions ) is the number of regions within that image , and each instance has eight features . discovered , and therefore the query performance can be improved .
5.3 Neural Network Techniques In our experiments , a three layer Feed Forward Neural f to map an image Network is used as the function region ( including those eight low level texture , color and shape features ) into the user ’s high level concept . By taking the three layer Feed Forward Neural Network as the mapping function fˆ and the back propagation ( BP ) learning algorithm as the gradient based search method in our Multiple Instance Learning framework , the neural network parameters such as the weights of all connections and biases of neurons are the parameters in γ that we want to learn ( search ) . Specifically , the input layer has eight neurons with each of them corresponding to one low level image feature . The output layer has only one neuron and its output indicates the extent to which an image segment meets the user ’s concept . The number of neurons at the hidden layer is experimentally set to eight . The biases to all the neurons are set to zero , and the used activation function in the neuron is Sigmoid Function . The BP learning method was applied with learning rate 0.1 and no momentum . The initial weights of the connections in the network are randomly set with relatively small values . The termination condition of the , BP algorithm is based on MSE thk iteration and αis where a small constant . In our experiments , αis set to 0005

Figure 2 . The interface of the proposed CBIR system and query results by using a simple distance based metric of image similarity
5.4 CBIR System Description Based on the proposed framework , we have constructed a content based image retrieval system . Figure 2 shows the interface of this system . As can be seen from this figure , the query image is the image at the top left corner . The user can press the ‘Get’ button to select the query image and press the ‘Query’ button to perform a query . The query results are listed from top left to bottom right in decreasing order of their similarities to the query image . The user can use the pull down list under an image to input his/her feedback on that image ( Negative or Positive ) . After the feedback , the user can carry out the next query . The user ’s concept is then learned by the system in a progressive way through the user feedback , and the refined query will return a new collection of the matching images to the user .
5.5 Experimental Results A number of experiments are conducted to test our proposed framework . Usually , it converges after 6 iterations of the user feedbacks . Also , in many cases , the user ’s most interested region of the query image can be
Figure 3 . The query results after 5 iterations of user feedback
As shown in Figure 2 , there is one horse on the lawn in the query image . Assume the horse object ( not the lawn ) is what the user is really interested in . Figure 3 shows the initial retrieval results using a simple distance based metric of image similarity according to Equation ( 12 ) . As can be seen from this figure , many retrieved images contain lawns or green mountains without any animal object in them . The reason why they are considered more similar to the query image is that they have regions ( eg , lawn ) very similar to the lawn region of the query image . However , what the user really needs are the images with the horse object in them . By integrating the user ’s feedback with Multiple Instance Learning , the proposed
CBIR system can solve the above problem since the user can provide his/her relevant feedback to the system by labeling each image as Positive or Negative . In Figure 2 , those images with bounding boxes are labeled Positive , while the others are labeled Negative by the user . Such feedback information is then fed into the Multiple Instance Learning method to discover user ’s real interest and thus capture the user ’s high level concept . Figure 3 shows the query results after 5 iterations of user feedback . The image repository includes eight images with the horse object in them . In addition to the query image , all the remaining seven images are successfully retrieved by the system . Especially , all of them have higher ranks than other retrieved images . Another interesting result is that some of the retrieved images , such as the sunset images , have been retrieved because of their similarity in color to the horse region of the query image . On the other hand , all the images with the pure lawn or the green mountain are filtered out during learning procedure . Therefore , this example illustrates that our proposed framework is effective in identifying the user ’s specific intention and thus can mine the user ’s high level concepts . the feedback and
6 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper , we presented a multimedia data mining framework to discover user ’s high level concepts from low level image features using Relevance Feedback and Multiple Instance Learning . Relevant Feedback provides a way to obtain the subjectivity of the user ’s high level vision concepts , and Multiple Instance Learning enables the automatic learning of the user ’s high level concepts . Especially , Multiple Instance Learning can capture the user ’s specific interest in some region of an image and thus can discover user ’s high level concepts more precisely . In order to test the performance of the proposed framework , a content based image retrieval ( CBIR ) system using Relevant Feedback and Multiple Instance Learning was developed and several experiments were conducted . The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework .
