ABSTRACT In online peer to peer commerce places where physical examination of the goods is infeasible , textual descriptions , images of the products , reputation of the participants , play key roles . Visual image is a powerful channel to convey crucial information towards e shoppers and influence their choice . In this paper , we investigate a well known online marketplace where over millions of products change hands and most are described with the help of one or more images . We present a systematic data mining and knowledge discovery approach that aims to quantitatively dissect the role of images in e commerce in great detail . Our goal is two fold . First , we aim to get a thorough understanding of impact of images across various dimensions : product categories , user segments , conversion rate . We present quantitative evaluation of the influence of images and show how to leverage different image aspects , such as quantity and quality , to effectively raise sale . Second , we study interaction of image data with other selling dimensions by jointly modeling them with user behavior data . Results suggest that “ watch ” behavior encodes complex signals combining both attention and hesitation from buyer , in which image still holds an important role when compared to other selling variables , especially for products for which appearance is important . We conclude on how these findings can benefit sellers in a high competitive online e commerce market .

INTRODUCTION
Consumers enjoy the convenience and low price offered by online shopping . However , since there is no physical interaction be tween buyers and sellers , these benefits may be diminished by increased risk due to product uncertainty and seller uncertainty . In online transaction , trust is an essential dimension of success [ 16 ] . Online reputation systems can reflect seller credits based on past transaction and crowd wisdom [ 8 , 24 ] . Yet , each individual product purchase involves understanding the product better . Information and communication with sellers are mostly limited through text , creating a sense of anxiety among online shoppers [ 28 ] . Fortunately , product images ( or other multimedia format ) provide a unique yet profound channel to convey visual information to buyer . It provides buyer , who must put considerable dollars at risk , a way to view and inspect the item before making the decision .
Pictures from online personal albums and social sites are typically used to record events or share visual elements of creativity and beauty . On the other hand , product images are used to provide a clear and attractive picture in a trust worthy way in order to convey information to consumers about the product and its quality . With the advent of digital cameras and phone based cameras , capturing and sharing of images and videos have become prevalent . For instance , according to one source , over 200K images are uploaded to Facebook per minute ; 16 billion images have been shared on Instagram ; eBay sellers upload above 20 million product images everyday . While most images are for human consumption , on platforms like Amazon , Craigslist and eBay , images form an important component for commerce to happen . While Amazon curates and standardizes the images given its catalog based commerce , on eBay , given the diversity of the products , product conditions , and the sellers , there are huge variations among images in terms of quantity and quality . In fact , a large portion of inventory images are taken by individual sellers who do not possess professional photography skills , which leads to significant variations in image quality [ 11 ] .
Studies on selling strategies and trust issues for online shopping are widespread in the literature [ 6 , 28 , 16 ] , without focus on role of product images . Previous research on importance of images in an e commerce scenario can be found in [ 3 , 4 , 10 , 26 , 17 , 20 , 14 , 27 ] . However , studies related to image quality and quantity are only drawn from small user groups , which may not be extensible to realistic vast online markets . Large scale studies only look at inclusion of images in the success of auctions , without importance to image quality or quantity . Also , we still know little about the effects of image in marketplace where majority of images are taken by individual customers rather being well designed by merchandising standard , and little of to what extent , images influence user‘s online shopping choice and behavior .
The goal of this research is to get a thorough understanding of impact of images across various key dimensions . While a successful online transaction is dependent on many factors , such as prod uct ( price & quality ) , advertisement ( listing title , description , and image ) , service ( shipping & return & communication & security ) , buyer‘s intention and seller‘s qualification , we particularly focus on answering the following questions in relation to product images in e commerce :
• How images of listings differ across categories , sellers , or specific attributes of the item , such as condition ?
• Does visual information always help to improve the conversion rate for online shopping by increasing trust and reducing perceived risk , and if it does , in what respect and to what extent ?
• How to leverage various image properties ( display format , quality or quantity ) to raise sale cost effectively ?
• How images impact buyer behavior/experience ? For instance , how sensitive are experienced buyers to different quality and quantity of product images ?
• How important are images as compared to other selling vari ables ?
Specifically , we choose three important aspects of images : 1 ) the display format , 2 ) number of images per product , and 3 ) image quality . We do a cross study of their relationship with multiple key dimensions in e commerce , such as conversion rate , seller and buyer , buyer experience and engagement .
We believe that given the significant growth in online shopping , investigation of these issues allows better selling strategies to be designed and better understanding of consumer‘s behavior and their preference .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . In section 2 , we review research background , formulate our problem and discuss previous related work in literature . Two major data sets are introduced in section 3 . Section 4 presents an overview of the role of images in e commerce in terms of category , seller and buyer segments , buyer activity and experience , and conversion rate . Also , using product resale ( where buyers resell products purchased from other sellers in the same marketplace ) as an exemplar , we show improved sell through and profit by improving image factors . Section 5 studies factors that affect buyer ’s behavior of adding items to watch list . We show that the “ watch ” action is double faced with complex signals that can be attributed to various factors , including those related to image . Moreover , we propose a binomial action model , and describe the use of logistic regression as a means of combining individual variables and determining significant factors . Section 6 lists some concluding remarks and possible future work .
2 . BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK Online marketplaces have significantly grown in the past decade affording both local and global online trade . Many of these markets are peer to peer in nature and have encouraged useful research on topics like consumer behavior , trust , selling strategy , cross border languages [ 6 ] .
Online shopping process consists of five steps similar to those associated with traditional shopping behavior [ 19 ] , including a ) a need for some product or service , b ) search online marketplace for need related information , c ) attracted by information about products or services , d ) evaluate/compare alternatives , e ) make the final decision for purchasing and being provided with post sale services . Studies have shown that shopping behavior is significantly influenced by trust and perceived risk , consumer‘s attitude , social influence , etc . [ 21 ] . Trust and the perceived risk are the very essential issues for online market [ 28 , 16 ] . This is mainly due to the information asymmetry of online market [ 2 ] , which causes difficulty for sellers to credibly disclose product information and for buyers to obtain relevant information to evaluate product quality . Risk in each transaction is essentially created by the threats to obtain misleading/incorrect information from the item , thus facing adverse consequences of engaging in e commerce . With no buildings or staff to evaluate , and no physical items to inspect , consumer decisions rest purely on the the descriptions and pictures provided [ 13 ] . Therefore , effective communication between buyer and seller is very important to break up this asymmetry hurdle . Effective product presentation must be visible , clear , and credible [ 22 ] . However , text information such as title and listing description can only provide information within the scope of language , while the valuable visual information is lost .
Previous research has shown the use of pictures to be important to buyers when buying on one of the largest e commerce market eBay [ 3 , 10 , 4 , 20 , 26 ] . Study in [ 5 ] indicated that product picture is one of the most influential risk reducing factors . The author found in their particular case that either a real picture of the product actually being sold or a stock picture is a risk reducing factor that will improve the outcomes of the auction for the seller . The inclusion of the real picture is proved to be effective in increasing auction success , effectiveness , and the value of the final bid . While a stock picture also significantly increases the final bid , the probability of auction success is not enhanced . Study in [ 18 ] looks at number of images embedded in item descriptions in eBay motors and draws the conclusion that more images help to boost the selling , especially for old cars . The author also found strong correlation of photo and price for non dealers , which is possibly because buyers cannot rely on reputation as an alternate source of information about quality .
Moreover , evidence has been presented that clear and detailed pictures of the products also help to reduce perceived risk associated with online purchasing [ 14 , 17 , 27 ] . Based on the study of a smaller user group , the Keynote study in 2005 ( [15 ] ) reveals the importance of better quality images as a number of shoppers expressed their preference to see both higher quality photographs and more images in item descriptions .
Recent study showed that certain image features can also help to improve click through rate in product search engine [ 11 , 7 ] . The authors conducted experiments to show that including image features in a machine learned click based ranking model improves the NDCG ( normalized discounted cumulative gain ) of the search results . The work in [ 4 ] studies the ability to attract customers and likelihood of transaction by including a binary variable indicating whether an image is associated with the listing . They found positive evidence for inexpensive products that providing image can increase number of bidding .
The above mentioned research work address the observed benefit of using images for listing descriptions . However , none of the above work has done a systematic and thorough study on the impact of images on online shopping , either from both the quantity and quality sides of image , or cross various dimensions of online shopping from seller to buyer , or from user experience to user behavior . Also , these work do not provide the answers to the question that , given known importance of image presence for online transaction , to what extend image affect user‘s attention and decision for a product , how does it compare to other key factors such as price or seller reputation , etc .
3 . DATA PREPARATION
To avoid bias from studying a smaller user group , in this study , we collect data from real online listing at a large scale . We con struct two major data sets from the universe of product listings from a popular online peer to peer marketplace . We want to understand , at the highest level , the impact on user engagement and purchase of the number of images ; the quality of images ; and the way they are laid out ( display type ) . We would also like to know what kind of sellers benefit from these aspects of images . Particularly , the data focuses on three different aspects of a listing image : a ) the display type , b ) the number of images per listing , and c ) the image quality for the dominant image ( the one shown up on the product search page ) .
The first dataset includes randomly chosen product listings from the year 2011 2012 . Since displaying type or using multiple images are optional for seller ( and costs the sellers ) , the data may be sparse . It is used to learn the first two aspects of images in relation to conversion rate and seller type . Detailed results are presented in section 4.1 and 42 The second data set is mainly used for studying image quality factors . The data covers randomly sampled listings created on several random selected months in the year of 2012 . In this dataset , there are in total 4658711 listings . Among them , 889541 are fixed price listings , and others are auctions . This data is used to perform analysis in section 4.3 and 52 We further expand this data set with great details to study buyer‘s “ watch ” behavior in section 53 Detailed information include title , seller information , item condition , shipping information , gallery type , displaying type , auction type , stock photo indicator , listing duration , image quality and counts , etc
One additional resale data is also collected as special exemplar case to gain deeper understandings on our major findings . Detailed information can be found in section 44
4 . AN OVERVIEW OF IMAGES IN
E COMMERCE
In this section , we study the impact of image display type , the number of images , and the quality of images . 4.1 Photo Display Type
Question 1 : What is the effect of custom photos versus original catalog photos on users ?
Stock photos are catalog images with high quality . Seller can choose “ use stock photo ” option without taking and uploading their own photos , but a note stating that the item picture is a stock photo will appear below the photo . We investigate the conversion rate of items using and not using stock photo . Result shows that the conversion rate for items in our dataset using stock photo is only about about half of what it is for items not using stock photo . This result is consistent with previous finding that an actual digital picture of the item being sold will likely increase the probability of success , and the benefit to using a stock source of photos is rather limited [ 5 ] .
Question 2 : Does Size Matter ? The default format for displaying photo is the Standard Show . The platform also provides seller with few other enhanced features with small amount of additional fees . There are features like EPS Picture Show that enables buyers to browse the item pictures or run them in a slide show at the top of the item listing ; Picture Pack that offers special pricing for multiple pictures ( up to 12 ) . Super Size Picture will display images in an enlarged manner . Table 1 shows the conversion rate of few major options . Results indicate that larger photos , which provide more information for buyer to inspect details of the product , increase the chance of success for an online selling .

Table 1 : Conversion Rate vs . Photo Display Type , which shows larger picture and pleasing browsing experience increase chance of success in sale . Numbers of sold and listed items are rounded to millions ( M ) .
Figure 3 : Photo Count distribution vs . Conversion Rate for top sellers and casual sellers . Observed from the curve plots , conversion rate doubled twice when using two images as compared to using one picture . Observed from the bar plots , casual sellers tend to upload more pictures than top sellers as they have low volume to sell and can afford more effort on each item to add more pictures .
4.2 Photo Count
Question 3 : More pictures , more information ? Better conver sion ?
Figure 3 shows the normalized distribution of items sold by experienced sellers ( green bar ) and casual sellers ( yellow bar ) , and the conversion rate ( red and blue curves ) in terms of number of images per item ( photo count ) . Common to both experienced seller and casual seller , most of the items only have one image . Also , both the conversion rate shows a log like growth pattern at the beginning . Clearly , by giving buyers more complete information from different views of object , the probability of success is increased , as we can see that conversion rate is almost doubled twice by using two images as compared to using a single one . In our data , more than 3 pictures seem to have a small impact . Further , comparing the normalized distribution of experienced and casual sellers ( bar plot ) , we can see that casual sellers tend to use more images than experienced sellers . One possible explanation is that casual sellers have lower volume of items to be sold , thus can afford more effort for each single item to take or upload more images . 4.3
Image Quality
Quality of product images is important in helping the customer make decisions [ 14 , 27 , 17 , 15 ] . Not only they are important to convey the visual information to buyers , also they are viewed as a visual proof of the quality of the real product and even the seller . Buyers expect clear , clean and even visually enjoyable images . A high quality or professionally photographed image may help to draw attentions from buyer or boost buyer‘s confidence for the product that they are interested in . On the contrary , poor images may countermand this benefit .
Figure 1 : Image quality vs . Seller type for each meta category . Casual sellers are low volume seller , where titanium seller are of highest selling volume . Top sellers tend to use better quality images and casual sellers generally have lower quality images .
Figure 2 : Image quality vs . Buyer type for each meta category for complete transactions . A type buyer are the most frequent buyer , and E type buyer are least active buyer . Experienced buyers show less sensitivity as compared to inexperienced buyers who show more concern about the quality of image .
While image quality is a highly content dependent and subjective concept , a proper measurement for this fundamental property is to evaluate whether a listing image is able to convey accurate information about the product effectively . In a peer to peer marketplace , where there is huge diversity of content providers , image quality can vary quite a bit even for similar products . Common image quality problems include : bad lighting , cluttered background , blur , specular reflection , and bad composition . Thus , focusing on the preference of product image from e commerce perspective , we employ quality score that emphasizes on the clarity of the foreground object , high brightness , strong contrast between foreground and background , clean and uniform background , etc For each image , scores that represent each of these visual aspects , eg brightness or contrast , are computed and used as features to describe the image . A linear regression model is trained based on human rated data , where each annotator rates the image quality to be good , fair or bad . The learned model is then used to aggregate all the features to predict the overall quality of the image . Because some of the these features are computed from RGB values ( 0 255 ) , as a convention , the range of quality score is also kept in [ 0 , 255 ] , whereas a score of 255 means the best quality . Potential readers are referred to [ 7 , 11 ] for details .
We study image qualities in relation to seller , buyer and their experience . Sellers are divided into different levels ( casual , bronze , silver , gold , platinum , titanium ) based on increasing amount of sales made and revenue generated . Buyers are also grouped into several levels ( A,B,C,D,E ) based on their spend over the last 12 months . A type buyer spends the most , while E type buyer spends the least . What we focus here on is the relative grades between sellers and between buyers .
Figures 1 and 2 show the evidences that : Question 4 : How do quality of pictures vary with seller levels ? Question 5 : How do different classes of buyers respond to image quality ?
We found that more successful the sellers are , the better quality images they use for their listings . However , limited to professional photograph tools and skills , qualities by casual seller are generally worse than top seller . This also corresponds to our finding that quality of images for used items are generally lower than that for new items ( as casual sellers typically sell used products ) .
On the other hand , Figure 2 shows that , in general , new buyers prefer listings with high quality images which can provide more assurance on the product , whereas frequent buyers show less concern on possible risk for listings with low quality images , with few exceptions for categories such as Music and Antiques . This confirms the previous findings that perceived risk can be reduced by knowledge , skill , and experience on the Internet ( [23 , 25 , 12] ) . 4.4 Resale : Profiting from better pictures
To understand how changes in image ( quantity & quality ) can make a difference , we collect a set of pairs of resale data . The initial sale are listings ended at several randomly selected time windows across 3 months of 2012 . Each window covers 15 days . A valid resale is identified if the same buyer re lists the item within 3 months after he/she bought from the initial sale . We restrict that both listings have the same title and are listed under the same leaf category . We are aware that there are professional sellers who conduct resale at the site by buying lots and then selling individually after modifying titles and other descriptions . However,we found that relaxing the condition to include pairs with similar titles introduces noise and the data become unreliable . We also filter out any items that use stock photos . The final data set consists of 55396 pairs of listings in total .

( 1 ) where RP is the profit rate and RQ is the quality improvement rate . α is a smoothing parameter as some of the initial sale items may not have any image . We choose α = 0.1 in the experiments . As shown in Figure 3 , increment of conversion rate follows a logarithmiclike growth pattern at the beginning . Hence , we formulate RC as the incremental rate of photo count , rather than using the absolute photo number .
Figure 4 shows the most profit and least profit leaf categories , along with their average profit rate . One can see that resale of Electronic items tends to be easier to make profit . Figure 5 shows the relationship between average RC , RQ and RP for top metacategories . We found a clear trend that as photo count increases , the probability of making profit also increases . However , image quality shows very small changes between the initial listing and the resale item . We also compute the correlation between RC and RP for top 20 leaf categories , resulting in 0.788 , while correlation between RQ and RP is only about 0032 Note that correlation is computed using scores from each item , not from the average profit rate that is shown in Figure 5 .
By browsing image pairs in this resale dataset , we notice that reseller may change product images , but in general is able to maintain the quality of picture since the initial sale serves as an example of selling . Some resellers even copy photos from the previous seller , and only make slight modification , such as cropping the image . An example is shown in Figure 6 .

5 . WATCHING THE WHEELS
Shopping processes can involve various states and stages like “ viewing a product ” , “ sharing with friends ” , “ adding to wish list ” , “ adding to watch list ” , “ adding to shopping cart ” , and finally , “ buying ” . We would like to understand the role of images in these steps in the pipeline of a shopping process .
Among all kinds of buyer behaviors , in this paper , we investigate the buyer‘s “ add to watch list ” behavior . We believe that although “ add to watch list ” may not necessarily lead to a check out action ,
Figure 5 : Resale profit rate vs . photo count increment rate for top 15 meta categories . Strong correlation between increment in photo count and profit rate .
To analyze the changes of image factors and profit made from the resale , we compute relative changes in photo count C , image quality Q and price P ( item price plus shipping & handling fees ) by comparing resale ( denoted by b ) with initial sale ( denoted by a ) : it embeds a more serious shopping attitude and intention than others behaviors , such as click through , or visiting a page .
Unlike actions such as “ add to cart ” , whereas users have to either confirm their decision for purchase or replace/remove the item from the cart later on , “ watch ” action comes with lower cost and pressure since no further action is required . It can also be used to reserve an item for a long term purpose . Moreover , “ watch ” encodes more individual preference , and is less influenced by other buyers in the market . Unlike other actions , the number of watch is always hidden from buyer . For example , at the search result page , the current bidding price and number of bids are often shown to buyers . Study has shown that in competitive situations , online auctions are likely to intensify , as bidders are emotionally involved [ 1 ] . Similarly , at the listing page , numbers of actions for “ like ” , “ want ” , and “ own ” are also shown . Buyers may be biased towards items with a higher number of bids or being liked by many people .
However , it would be naive to assume that “ watch ” only encodes user‘s interest and attention for the product . It‘s essentially a coin with two sides . As consumers are in the middle stage of a shopping process ( browse , compare , decide , checkout ) , the “ watch ” behavior should therefore involve buyer‘s a ) interest/intention for the item which causes them to seriously put the item under check , and b ) hesitation as they are putting the item on hold to compare with other similar items , weigh the risk and take time to make the decision .
To understand this behavior , in the following section , we first analyze the relationship between watch and conversion rate . The goal is to see if our assumption that watch action encodes user‘s interest in the item is true . Second , we decompose this action by analyzing influential/related selling variables , particularly incorporate image related factors . 5.1 Buying Myself a Chance
The action of watching an item can be attributed to many things . Although we can not directly quantify how much interest the user has for the item through this action , we can assume that higher interest may transfer to higher probability of purchase . To prove this , Figure 7 ( a ) shows the changes in conversion rate given the watch popularity ( in terms of the frequency of watch ) . It clearly shows that more “ watch ” indicates the product draws more interest from user , and resulting in higher conversion rate . This phenomenon peaks at about 20 watches , with a slightly down trend afterwards , which is possibly due to the lack of data samples to obtain a stable prediction ( items with higher watch numbers are very sparse ) . It is also possible that a higher watch number indicates more competitive market . To get a sense of how watched item is compared to the overall inventory , Figure 7 ( b ) shows the averaged conversion rate per meta category . In general , having more than 10 watches indicates higher market demand , and an above average conversion rate .
Figure 8 shows the percentage of the transactions that is made from watchers ( buyers that made the watch action ) , for the items being watched and successfully sold . It can be seen that nearly one third of the transactions come from watchers . Especially , percentage is higher for “ unique ” items , such as categories : music , crafts , and books . This is possibly due to that buyers often have clearer intentions for items in these categories or because items are “ unique ” , buyers have fewer alternative options and end up going back to purchase the one they bookmarked through watching . 5.2 Better Image = More Watch ?
As many variables may affect “ watch ” behavior , we particularly want to understand the influence of image factors . Does a better image lead to more attention from buyer and how does it compare
( a ) Conversion rate vs . watch popularity
( b ) Overview of conversion rate for various meta categories
Figure 7 : Conversion Rate wrt watch popularity and overall rate for each meta category .
Figure 8 : Conversion rate vs . watch popularity . to other key factors that also influence this action ? Also , some products rely more on their visual , eg clothing . Other products , eg electronics , rely more on their specifications and functionality , since only limited design models are available . Given such intrinsic difference , will it affect the importance of image in presenting the product ?
To answer these questions , we collect listing data during the Fall season of 2012 . Detailed information of this dataset is given in section 3 . We first compare image quality with the number of “ watch ” per item . As shown in Figure 9 , irrespective of the category of the products , data exhibits a strong correlation between image quality and watch count .
In order to understand buyer‘s behavior from the product category level , we also look at the performance of four top metacategories . We divide these four categories into two groups . TypeA categ , including Clothing , Shoes and Accessories , Consumer Electronics , is more apparel based and popular . On the other hand , type B categ is of more unique product , which includes Coins & Paper Money , Books . It can be seen from Figure 11 that type Acateg shows much stronger response to image quality than type Bcateg . Type A categ also has higher average watch action as com
Figure 9 : Overall trend of “ watch ” per item versus image quality score .

( a ) Consumer electronics
( b ) Coins & Paper Money
( c ) Clothing , Shoes & Accessories
( d ) Books
Figure 11 : Examples of several top meta categories : correlation of “ watch ” per item versus image quality score .
Then the amount of “ watch ” Y ( watch count ) that a listing item received can be viewed as a result of a sequence of each these trials . The distribution of this count in the Nth trial is a binomial distribution Y ∼ Binomial(N , π ) .
Logistic regression models are often used to understand the role of input variables in explaining the outcome [ 9 ] , where the response variable follows a binomial distribution . It can be formulated as : log(
π
1 − π
) = β0 + β1x1 + . . . + βnxn
+ δ1d1 + . . . + δmdm +
( 3 ) pared to type B categ . Differences between categories indicate the different roles of images cross various products . It is reasonable to assume that for products that more depend on their looking , image is likely to be a more important channel for communication . Trendy categories also imply that high competition may cause buyer to hold the item and look around for other candidates . This is less likely to happen for type B categ . Because items are unique , there are less competition from peers and fewer available alternatives in the market .
Figure 10 also plots the normalized item distribution in terms of image quality for fixed price ( green ) and auctions ( yellow ) , respectively . The peak around 170 180 shows that many images have moderate qualities . We also found a similar peak around the same position in the red curve , which is the watch number per item for fixed price listings . We think this co occurrence is not random . It ’s possibly because intensive competition between similar items holds back buyers from immediate purchase and increases the possibility that buyer adds the item into watch list for further comparison . 5.3 Action Model : A Regression Explanation As shown in above section , “ watch ” action as one of the user engagement factor reveals complex signals combining both attention and hesitation from buyer . In order to model this action , we need to consider factors from both sides of the coin .
Assume each action “ watch ” ( or not ) from the buyer is a binary outcome W from a set of selling variables . It can be modeled by Bernoulli trial as “ watch ” ( Wi = 1 ) and “ not watch ” ( Wi = 0 ) for the ith trial with probability :
P r(Wi = 1 ) = πi
( 2 )
π where the log value of the odds 1−π of taking action can be approximated by a linear combination of continuous input variables x1 . . . xn , and dichotomous variables d1 . . . dm with values 0 or 1 . Based on the observations and discussions we had in previous sections , we select several selling dimensions and image related factors as input variables , including item price , shipping price , number of photos per item ( photo count ) , number of word tokens in title ( title length ) , seller type ( 0 as casual seller , 1 as top seller ) , item condition ( new or used ) , seller‘s feedback positive ratio ( percentage of positive feedback over all feedback ) , log of total feedback score , auction duration days ( auct durn days ) , bold title ( 0 as standard title , 1 as bold title ) , three gallery types , two display types , and keyword popularity ( P opkw ) .
The three gallery types are : Standard , Gallery and Gallery Plus . Gallery as gallery view which is using a bigger size of images . Gallery Plus enhances the image displaying in the search results by displaying a larger picture and provide a magnifying glass and enlarge link . Photo display type include : Standard and Picture Pack which offers special pricing for multiple pictures . We have also discussed these features in section 41
Keyword Popularity is used to encode the competition especially between popular items . We only use the title information as the product search engine highly depends on title . To compute this score , we first group listings based on their leaf category . Then , we parse each title to get tokens of words and corresponding count . We choose top tokens as the most popular keywords for each leaf category . In the experiment , for each leaf category we choose average token count as the threshold to select the popular keyword set Skw(c ) , where Skw is the popular keyword set for leaf category c . For a listing l(c ) from leaf category c with title t , the keyword popularity score is computed by :
| f ( Sw(t))(cid:84 ) Skw(c ) |
P opkw(t(l ) , c ) =
| f ( Sw(t ) ) |
( 4 ) where | S | is the cardinality of the set S . Sw(t ) is the set of word tokens for title t . f is the function to filter out some stop words and punctuation , such as “ the ” , “ of ” , “ ! ” , etc . We kept some common words such as “ new ” , “ free ” , “ size ” . Although they are commonly seen in titles and do not provide discriminative information to differentiate listings , our goal is instead to highlight the competition . These words are usually top queries and play important role in product search as many buyers try to search product with certain condition or with free shipping and handling . Taking the leaf category “ iPad/Tablet/eBook Accessories ” as an example , the popular keyword set Skw includes : “ crystal , protective , touchpad , apple , ereader , portable , magnetic , compatible , dual , camera , bluetooth , slim , amazon , 3gs , 4s ” , and many others . While for “ Women‘s Clothing:Athletic Apparel ” category , the popular keyword list instead consists of “ yoga , v neck , seamless , nike , gym , fit , golf , hoodie , cotton , compression , zip , workout , cycling , combat , adidas , shot , stretch ” , and so on . 5.4 Regression Results & Discussion
Since market and consumer‘s intention change dramatically cross different categories , we therefore apply regression model to each meta category . Category variables include item condition ( new or used ) , seller type ( casual , top ) , gallery types , bold title , and display types . Regression is computed using the first level of each category variable as reference . Others are treated as continuous variables . We also filter out items with watch count over 50 , which rarely occur . Then we normalize the count to be within the range of [ 0 , 1 ] . Tables 2 and 3 show the regression results for Clothing , Shoes & Accessories ( CSA ) , and Consumer Electronics .
For both categories , common significant factors include photo count , item condition , keyword popularity score and auction duration days . Photo count shows significant positive impact as we expected . Using condition new as reference , condition(used ) shows negative impact on attracting the buyer . With longer listing time , item has more chances to be exposed to consumers , therefore auction duration days is one of the major factors . Keywords help the item to have higher exposure , thus be search able and accessible to the buyers . A higher keyword popularity score means larger overlap between title and the popular keyword set from the leafcategory that the item belongs to . This also indicates more intensive competition from peers .
Besides photo count , other image related variables , such as image quality and display types show more significant impact on CSA as compared to Electronics . We also found similar results for other electronic related categories . This corresponds to our assumption that apparel related category may gain more benefits from providing visual content for consumers . Also , we notice that Electronic category has overall better quality images since it‘s easier to obtain standard product image . Sellers also tend to employ good quality images from other sellers . Therefore , the competition between sellers and the focuses from buyers in regards to the product more likely rely on other factors instead of image .
6 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK Given only scattered evidence in literature that inclusion of image or other multimedia information may help improve transaction rate , in this paper , we dive into three major aspects of image : display format , number of views presented per item , and their quality . We focus on understanding not only yes or no question but to

Table 3 : Logistic Regression Results for “ Consumer Electronics ” . Image quality appears to be less significant for Electronics as compared to CSA category . This is due to high similarity among product photos used by sellers , which drives shopper‘s attention to other selling factors . what extent images affect online transactions , and how they compare with other selling variables . We analyze conversion rate , seller & buyer segments , consumer experience and interaction behavior in responding to each of the image aspects .
Our results show positive evidence that images help increase buyer‘s attention , trust and conversion rate . Among the three properties of images , our study shows that increasing number of images of the product , which is equivalent to providing more complete visual representation of the product , is an effective way to improve sell through . For marketplaces that cater to used , refurbished , and resale products where most sellers are casual sellers , the impact of image quality is limited to certain extent , since users , especially experienced users , may have developed certain level of tolerance towards poor quality images . However , image quality still serves as an important factor especially for goods where appearance plays a key role . Additionally , one should be aware that the norm of market can dramatically change when comparing this type of market to other markets where only high quality images are used . In that case , quality of product may become a symbol of the quality of

In other words , cross market seller should be aware of differences between markets , and adapt their strategy accordingly . We believe this is the first systematic analysis on this subject that jointly considers key e commerce dimensions . Our studies provide a deeper understanding of the role of images in the e commerce flow .
Future studies include developing content based image quality to understand the impact of image aesthetics on attracting buyer‘s attention . We will also pursue modeling “ watch ” action using Graphical model for causal relationship analysis , to discover the transition relationship between “ watch ” and other behaviors , such as clickthrough , purchasing and adding to cart .
