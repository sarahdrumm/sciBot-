ABSTRACT MetaCrystal enables users to visualize and control the degree of overlap between the results returned by different search engines . Several linked overview tools support rapid exploration , facilitate complex filtering operations and guide users toward relevant information . MetaCrystal addresses the problem of the effective fusion of different search results by helping users to visually combine and filter the top results returned by the different engines . Users can apply weights to the search engines to create their own ranking functions . They can control the degree of overlap by modifying the URL directory depth used to match documents or by changing the number of top documents being compared .

1 . INTRODUCTION Users can choose from a multitude of Internet search engines , which tend to return different results for the same query [ 4 ] . Meta search engines address this limitation by combining the results by different engines . While some meta search engines visually organize the retrieved documents [ 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] , no meta search interface provides users with an overview of the precise overlap between the search engines . Meta searching can benefit from such a visualization , because : a ) it is difficult to predict the quality of coverage for single search engines , which tend to index less than 20 % of the Internet [ 6 ] ; b ) documents found by multiple retrieval methods are more likely to be relevant [ 2 ] ; c ) some engines are more effective than others , depending on the search domain ; d ) users prefer or trust some engines more than others .
2 . METACRYSTAL MetaCrystal consists of several overview tools to enable rapid exploration and complex filtering operations . The Category View groups and shows the number of documents retrieved by different search engine combinations . Modeled on the InfoCrystal layout [ 7 ] , the number of documents retrieved by all engines is shown in the center ( see Figure 1 ) . Shape ( size ) , color , proximity and orientation coding are used to visually organize the different

Figure 1 : ( Top ) The Category View shows the overlap between the top 100 items found by Google , Teoma , AltaVista , Lycos & MSN , when searching for ‘information visualization’ . ( Bottom ) If a URL equal to the server address is used to match items , then the overlap increases . Icons for items retrieved by at least 3 engines are selected . Shape ( size ) coding is used for icons ( not ) selected .

Figure 2 : ( Top ) The Cluster Bulls Eye View uses polar coordinates to place in close proximity documents with similar rankings by the different search engines . A document ’s radius is a function of the number of engines that retrieved it and the average of its different ranking scores . A document ’s angle reflects the relative ratio of its rankings by the different engines . ( Bottom ) Shows how all the documents cluster if the engines are assigned different weights of importance ( 1 , 0.75 , 0.5 , 1 , 0.25 ) and the radius is now equal to the weighted average of the rankings by the different engines . In both displays , the documents found by at least three engines are selected . Three documents are highlighted to show how their locations change when the weights are applied .
2 search engine combinations . The number of engines represented by a category icon decreases toward the periphery . Figure 1 ( top ) shows that 3 documents are found by all engines ; 4 documents are found by Google , AltaVista , Lycos and MSN but not Teoma ; and most of the documents are retrieved by only one engine . To improve the overlap , users can shorten the URL used to match documents . This reduces the number of unique documents in the result sets being compared , but it can increase the number of documents found by more than one engine ( see Figure 1 ( bottom) ) . The Cluster Bulls Eye View shows all the retrieved documents ; documents found by the same number of engines cluster in the same concentric ring and those with high rankings by the different engines cluster toward the center ( see Figure 2 ) . Shape , color and orientation coding show which engines retrieved a document . Users can apply different weights to the search engines to create their own ranking functions . Figure 2 ( bottom ) shows the resulting clustering of the documents if Google , Teoma , AltaVista , Lycos , and MSN are assigned the weights of 1 , 0.75 , 0.5 , 1 , and 0.25 , respectively . Search engines commonly display their results as ranked lists , which can only show a limited number of documents . The RankSpiral View overcomes this limitation by placing all documents along a spiral based on their total ranking scores . Details on demand gives users an immediate sense of a document ’s content and how the rankings by the different engines contributed to its total ranking score . MetaCrystal is implemented in Flash using ActionScript . It enables users to perform complex filtering operations visually to create a short list of potentially relevant documents by : a ) selecting only documents retrieved by a specific number of engines ; b ) specifying Boolean constraints ( the Category View represents all possible Boolean queries in disjunctive normal form [ 6] ) ; c ) applying a threshold based on the total ranking score ; d ) selecting icons or documents by clicking on them . Users can quickly scan the filtered results view , which shows a document ’s title , total ranking score and how the different engines contributed to its total ranking score . In summary , MetaCrystal addresses the problem of the effective fusion of different search results by enabling users to visually combine and filter the top documents retrieved by different search engines . Its complementary overview tools help users identify documents found by different engine combinations and at the same time scan the top documents retrieved by a single engine . 3 .
