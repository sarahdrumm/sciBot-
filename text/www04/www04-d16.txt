ABSTRACT Nowadays , the leading e learning platforms are converging towards standardization . This paper presents an extension to the SCORM , today ’s most well acclaimed e learning standard , enabling the modelling of course related entities that surround learning objects and content aggregations , therefore increasing the standard ’s modelling scope and allowing for gains in efficiency in knowledge dissemination . A prototype is being implemented and tested on VIANET , an original e learning platform with extensible support for the SCORM .

1 . INTRODUCTION Nowadays , e learning is becoming the most effective paradigm for spreading knowledge among distributed heterogeneous audiences [ 1 ] . The World Wide Web , largely due to its worldwide acceptance and popularity , is the natural vehicle for this kind of knowledge dissemination , as it can be inferred by looking at topleading e learning solutions such as WebCT [ 2 ] and others . In order to facilitate communication and knowledge sharing among e learning platforms , standards have been proposed for describing content metadata , course structure and navigation , and online interactions . The Sharable Content Object Reference Model ( SCORM ) [ 4 ] is the most prominent of those standards , enabling learning content reusability and portability across diverse Learning Management Systems ( LMS ) , and discoverability among content consumers . The SCORM ’s metadata model provides means for describing learning content from its most basic form – atomic resources such as text files , videos or presentations , to complex content aggregations , like lessons or entire courses . However , it is not practical for the SCORM to specifically model as bibliography , evaluation rules , or the course programme . This paper aims at addressing this shortcoming , and proposes a new extension to SCORM ’s information model for , increasing its ability to support accessibility and interoperability of learning course materials essential such

2 . EXTENDING THE DATA MODEL Due to the nature of the extension , whose application is intended to be as broad as possible , one major concern in defining the data model is to make it as flexible as possible , in order to maximize its modelling power or applicability . A new first level category is proposed , “ Environmental ” , which is a direct child of the top level node “ Lom ” ( from LOM , Learning Object Metadata [ 5] ) . This new category is parallel or has the same abstraction level as the nine main categories of the LOM metadata model , in which the SCORM is based on . Similarly to those main categories , “ Environmental ” is also a container , which consists of a set of nodes whose type is “ Item ” . As illustrated in Table 1 , a recursive hierarchy is proposed , in which data fields can be chained to describe arbitrarily complex structures that represent the modelled entities . The “ Item ” element is comprised of four child nodes . The “ Type ” node stipulates the kind of the item being described , and can be used by learning management systems to give semantic meaning to the item , therefore being able to behave in a customized manner towards them . As this node is meant to provide taxonomy for items , its possible values are restricted ; hence , its data type is Vocabulary . The currently defined type values are Programme , Bibliography , FAQ , Assessment , EvaluationRules , and TextElement . The “ Value ” field holds the identification or content of the item . As an example , when

238 modelling a course FAQ , the first step is to define an “ Environmental ” node in the course metadata file . The course FAQ is enclosed within one item node , whose type is FAQ ; the value field of this item is used to provide a title for LMS presentation . This node ’s data type is , therefore , Langstring , a LOM data type for describing strings of text . The “ Metadata ” field , a container node that can cover an entire LOM hierarchy , may be used to specify additional information about the item . In our example , this element would contain additional metadata information about the FAQ , referenced by a link to an external metadata file or placed inline with the FAQ item . Finally , the “ Item ” child node , a container whose structure is the same as its parent node , enables the recursive modelling of an item , as it is represented in Figure 1 .
Figure 1 . Item recursive structure and example application As shown in the figure , this allows for the enclosing of the Q&A pairs in an arbitrary number of child nodes to the FAQ item . Figure 2 illustrates the definition of one of such pairs in XML . The child item , whose type is TextElement , contains the question . Metadata is added to characterize the question , and improve classification and search efficiency . The answer is defined as a child node to the question item , as illustrated in the figure . 3 . CASE STUDY The proposed extension is being implemented and tested on the VIANET e learning platform [ 6 , 7 ] . As the platform supports multiple standards with online model configuration , the extension is applied to the SCORM data model by simply editing it in the platform ’s administration portal . Once this task is complete , the system is able to parse and properly import extended metadata . It is then possible to add support for the import and export of the course entities presented earlier in this paper . For instance , when importing a SCORM course , the Environmental node is parsed , and FAQ items are imported . This effectively increases course portability , as new course elements can be migrated across diverse platforms , and improves search efficiency , as more course materials are described by metadata .
4 . CONCLUSION This paper proposes an extension to the SCORM standard , based on identified shortcomings that limit its modelling scope in complex the proposed extension provides direct support for course entities other than traditional learning contents , namely the course programme , bibliography , frequently asked questions , assessments , and evaluation rules . While only few entities are defined in this learning environments . Specifically , extension , concern was taken to conceive a data model with generality in mind , enabling the support for other entities if needing to . The proposed extension thus effectively enhances the SCORM modelling scope , allowing for greater flexibility and effectiveness in the design of future learning management systems . The extension is tested in a real system , revealing clear gains in course portability and search efficiency .
