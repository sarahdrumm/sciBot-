ABSTRACT When human guess the content of a web page , not only the text on the page but also its appearance is an important factor . However , there have been few studies on the relationship between the content and visual appearance of a web page . We investigating the tendency between them , especially web content and color use , we found a tendency to use color for some kinds of content pages . We think this result opens the way to estimating web content using color information .

INTRODUCTION
When we guess the content of a web page , the page ’s visual appearance gives us a clue . However , most studies on automatically estimating web page content used only textual information and link structures with a few exception .
For example , Jianying and Amit[2 ] proposed a method of categorizing images in web pages . James and Jia[3 ] .ltered out adult sites by using the skin color of photographic images contained in websites .
Those methods focused only on images in web pages . If there are an general method of dealing with visual information on the whole web page , then it would improves the accuracy of guessing web page content .
In this paper , we focus on color use as one measure of page appearance . We explore the relationship between webpage content and color use .
In this research , we used an existing database constructed as a directory structure based on page content categories . For those categories , we researched the color tendencies .

2 . WEB PAGE SAMPLING 2.1 Selection of target web pages
The database that we selected is a collection of web pages by Open Directory Project ( ODP ) [ 1 ] . It has a standard directory structure for representing a hierarchy of categories and has links to connect subdirectories of similar meaning . In this study , we used only the directory structure to simplify our process .
The number of web pages registered in ODP is about three million . Accessing and capturing every pages waste a lot of time . Therefore , we selected samples from the database by a rule that subdirectories in a certain lower level are ignored randomly .
Consequently , the number of web pages , that we actually access to and capturinged is decrease to 116,403 . 2.2 Capturing and cleansing the data
The number of target pages is still large , so we capture rendered web pages automatically . However , the captured pages includes obviously unsuitable ones . For example , an image where the whole area is the default background color of the browser . This happens when a response from a server is too late and nothing is rendered . Therefore , we apply post processing to remove these inappropri ate captured images .
As the result , we had 62,052 pages as captured images .

3 . RESEARCH METHOD 3.1 Color information
Before analysis , we translate captured pages into histograms . The process fiow is shown in Figure 1 . First , we make histograms of hue , chroma , and brightness from one captured image . In the histogram , the vertical axis is a log scale . Three types of histograms are used separately in the following steps . Second , we merge histograms of one type for one subdirectory , and make one two dimensional histogram . This histogram shows the relationship between area size and one of hue , chroma or brightness in one content category .
The reason we use hue , chroma , and brightness instead of RGB value is that those values are more appropriate to human color perception . They are calculated from CIELAB , which is converted from sRGB values . Note that in the hue histogram we include an achromatic eld
Furthermore , the histogram is represented by a table where the that sum of each column is normalized . We performed this calculation for all subdirectories and whole the dataset .
The hue/size histogram for the whole dataset is shown in Ta ble11 . It shows the tendency of hue and size in all web pages . 3.2 Tendency analysis
To analyze the color tendency of a subdirectory , we subtract values in the table for the whole dataset from corresponding values in the subdirectory table . In the subtracted table , the color of a cell where the absolute value is large is a characteristic for the subdirectory .
Because the sum of each column is Table 1 is normalized , values can be regarded as the probability in the column . By using the probability equation of a multinomial distribution with Table 1 , we calculate PD , which is the appearance probability of each column in a subdirectory table .
From the value of 1=PD , we measure the strength of the ten dency of color used in a subdirectory .
4 . RESULTS
One table obtained for a directory ( cid:147)Home/Gardens(cid:148 ) is shown in Table 2 . Since the values of 1=PD for yellow and yellow green are large , we can recognize a characteristic in the hue for this category . Furthermore , by looking at the table carefully , we can determine that the area size for such a hue grows from the general tendency . Table 3 is the hue/size table of ( cid:147)Adult/Image Galleries(cid:148 ) , which are observed to have the strongest tendency about hue . From this , we can see that red , which includes skin color , is used more than for other subdirectories . 1G:Green , B:Blue , P:Purple , R:Red , Y:Yellow and AC:Achromatic Color

In the same way , Table 4 indicates the tendency to use high chro matic color in the ( cid:147)Kids and Teens(cid:148 ) category .
We examined 386 subdirectories having more than 100 web pages . In total , we found color tendencies in 139 categories , with the threshold value of 1=PD , 50 .
However , in the case of abstract categories like ( cid:147)Business(cid:148 ) , we could not .nd any signi.cant tendencies .
5 . CONCLUSION
These results show that there is a tendency of color use in some categories of web pages . This suggests the possibility of using color information for estimating web page .
