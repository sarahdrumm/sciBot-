ABSTRACT Semantic Web is challenged by the URI meaning issues arising from putting ontologies in open and distributed environments . As a try to clarify some of the meaning issues , this paper proposes a new approach to interpreting distributed ontologies , it ’s built on the top of local models semantics , and extends it to deal with the URI sharing by harmonizing the local models via agreement on vocabulary provenance . The commitment relationship is presented to allow the URI sharing between ontologies with richer semantics .

1 . INTRODUCTION To make the Semantic Web vision become reality , we are challenged by the URI meaning issues arising from putting OWL in open and distributed environments . Recently , there are some impetuous debates on the meaning of URI identifier used by OWL within Semantic Web research community . For example ( See http://listsw3org/Archives/Public/public sw meaning/ ) , should the meaning of URI be global or local ? Does the use of a URI as a name constitute some kind of a commitment or consent , either to meaning expressed on the web , or intended by a Name Authority ? As we know , OWL has a mechanism to import an OWL ontology into another OWL ontology . The owl:imports relationship is transitive , and if ontology O1 imports O2 and O2 imports O1 , then they are considered to be equivalent . The owl:imports construct provides just one mechanism for specifying a special kind of semantic relationship between distributed OWL ontologies . Recently , Paolo Bouquet et al . [ 1 ] give an extension to OWL with context , called C OWL , which is based on local models semantics [ 2 ] and distributed description logics [ 3 ] . C OWL allows us to contextualize ontologies . It ’s definitely a good start towards formal semantics for distributed ontologies . However , the vocabularies of local ontologies are supposed to be pair wise disjointed , and the globalization can only be obtained by using

It doesn’t fit very well in with one of the basic architectural principles of the Web , which allows anyone be able to freely add information about an existing resource using any vocabulary they please . Our position to the meaning issues is as follows : A name is meaningless for machine without context , and the distributed ontologies should be the key component of the context . We should find a way to make it clear what “ a distributed ontology ” should have in addition to a set of local ontologies , and how to interpret “ a distributed ontology ” .
2 . DISTRIBUTED ONTOLOGIES To simplify the presentation of our formalism , the distributed ontologies are assumed to be OWL DL ontologies . Some terminologies are as follows : A name is a URI ( literal is not discussed for simplicity ) . The vocabulary of an ontology is the set of names that occur in the ontology as individuals , classes and properties , except for built ins . We use Σ to denote a set of ontologies {Oi | i∈I} , here I be a set of indexes . V(Oi ) denotes the vocabulary of Oi , while VI(Oi ) , VC(Oi ) and VP(Oi ) denote the individual , class , and property vocabulary of Oi , respectively . The vocabulary of Σ , denoted by V(Σ ) , is the union of the vocabularies of ontologies within Σ , more formally , V(Σ)={ν | ν∈V(Oi ) , Oi∈Σ} . And VI(Σ ) , VC(Σ ) and VP(Σ ) denote the individual , class , and property vocabulary of Σ , respectively . We assume that VI(Σ ) , VC(Σ ) and VP(Σ ) are pair wise disjointed . Example 1 . ( Motivation example ) Consider Σ={O1 , O2} :
O1 : SubClassOf(A B ) ; SubClassOf(B C ) O2 : SubClassOf(C D ) ; SubClassOf(D A )
How to interpret the integration of the above two ontologies ( with some names shared ) ? The available approaches couldn’t give a satisfied answer to this question . Basically , our approach is based on the principle of local models semantics [ 2 ] , ie local ontology has its own interpretation universe , and these universes are related with each other by relations . In addition , the URI should and could be shared with different ontologies under some restriction . Such sharing is realizable under agreement on vocabulary provenance , and can be enriched by commitment relationship within distributed ontologies . Definition 1 . ( Agreement on vocabulary provenance ) Let Σ be a set of ontologies {Oi | i∈I} , an agreement on vocabulary provenance within Σ is a function from V(Σ ) to I , denoted by ρ:V(Σ ) → I , such that ν∈V(Oρ(ν ) ) for each ν∈V(Σ ) , ie for each ν∈V(Σ ) , ρ(ν ) ∈ { i∈I | ν∈V(Oi ) , Oi∈Σ } . We call ρ(ν ) the provenance of the name ν within Σ .

From now on , we use the term “ a distributed ontology ” to mean a set of ontologies plus an agreement on vocabulary provenance . Usually , we use ( Σ , ρ ) to denote a distributed ontology . We interpret distributed ontologies on the notion of local models [ 2 , 3 ] , and evolve it with the presence of agreement on vocabulary provenance . Definition 2 . ( Interpretations for distributed ontologies ) Let Σ = {Oi | i∈I } be a set of ontologies with ρ as an agreement on vocabulary provenance . An interpretation of ( Σ , ρ ) , denoted by ι , is composed of a pair <{ιi}i∈I,{rij}i,j∈I> such that 1 .
ιi is an OWL DL interpretation of Oi ( satisfying all of the axioms within Oi ) with local domain of ∆ιi . rij is the domain relation from i to j , ie a subset of ∆ιi × ∆ιj . ( each rii is always assumed to be the identity relation on ∆ιi )

3 . The harmonization constraint ( HC ) is satisfied : If ν∈V(Oj ) and ρ(ν ) = i , then νιj = rij(νιi )
( HC ) In this paper , we use rij(S ) ( for S being a subset of ∆ιi ) to denote the image of S via the domain relation rij , more formally , rij(S ) = {y∈∆ιj | ∃x∈S such that <x , y>∈rij } .
Notice that an element can be seen as a singleton set . We use rij(R ) ( for R being a binary relation on ∆ιi ) to denote the image of R via 1 , ie rij(R ) = {<y1 , y2>∈∆ιj×∆ιj rij , more formally , rij(R ) = rij ° R ° rij | ∃x1 , x2∈∆ιi such that <x1 , y1>∈rij , <x1 , x2>∈R , and <x2 , y2>∈rij} . Hence , the harmonization constraint can be refined as follows :
If ν∈VI(Oj ) and ρ(ν)=i , then {νιj} = rij({νιi} ) ( HCI ) If ν∈VC(Oj ) and ρ(ν)=i , then νιj = rij(νιi )
( HCC )
If ν∈VP(Oj ) and ρ(ν)=i , then
νιj = rij

Example 2 . ( Revisit example 1 ) Suppose there is an agreement on vocabulary provenance within Σ={O1 , O2} such that :
Let <{ι1 , ι2} , {r12 , r21}> be an interpretation of ( Σ , ρ ) . We have
ρ(A ) =1 , ρ(B ) =1 , ρ(C ) =2 , ρ(D ) =2
Aι1 ⊆ Bι1⊆ r21(Cι2 ) ( ie Cι1 ) Cι2 ⊆ Dι2⊆ r12(Aι1 ) ( ie Aι2 )
( E21 ) ( E22 )
We can not obtain that EquivalentClasses(A C ) in O1 or O2 in general because there is no constraint on the domain relations r12 and r21 , eg r12(r21(Cι2))====Cι2 . That ’s fine because it reflects the case where there are two different viewpoints co existed . We will revisit this example after the introduction of commitment relationship . Definition 3 . ( Commitment relationship ) Let ( Σ , ρ ) be a distributed ontology , a commitment relation on Σ , denote by Θ , is a binary relation on Σ . We say Oj commits to Oi when <Oi , Oj> ∈Θ . A complete commitment relation on Σ , denote by Ξ , is a subrelation of commitment relation on Σ and required to be transitive . Definition 4 . ( Satisfying of commitment ) . Let Ω ==== ( Σ , ρ , Θ , Ξ ) be a distributed ontology with commitment relations . An interpretation of ( Σ , ρ ) , <{ιi}i∈I,{rij}i,j∈I> , satisfies Θ and Ξ , iff
1 .
( CC )
The commutability constraint ( CC ) is satisfied : If <Oi , Oj>∈Θ , ν∈V(Oi ) and k = ρ(ν ) Then rkj(νιk ) = rij(rki(νιk ) ) If <Oi , Oj>∈Ξ , then rij is an embedded identity relation .
2 . When an interpretation of ( Σ , ρ ) satisfies Θ and Ξ , we call it an interpretation of ( Σ , ρ , Θ , Ξ ) . The complete commitment relationship is introduced to formalize the owl:imports mechanism . Example 3 . ( Revisit example 2 ) Furthermore , suppose O2 commits to O1 . We will derive that A is equivalent to C in O2 . Due to the commitment of O2 to O1 , ρ(C)=2 , by ( CC ) , we have r22(Cι2 ) ==== r12(r21(Cι2) ) , so we have
Cι2 ==== r12(r21(Cι2 ) )
( E31 )
Together with ( E21 ) and ( E22 ) , we have Cι2 ⊆ r12(Aι1 ) ⊆ r12(r21(Cι2 ) ==== Cι2
So we have Cι2 ==== r12(Aι1 ) ( ie Aι2 ) , then it is concluded that EquivalentClasses(A C ) in O2 . But we still can’t obtain that EquivalentClasses(A C ) in O1 unless O1 commits to O2 . That ’s the intended effect of the commitment .
3 . DISCUSSION As a try to clarify some of the URI meaning issues , this paper proposes the notion of agreement on vocabulary provenance and the notion of commitment between ontologies , and presents a new approach to interpreting distributed ontologies , which is based on local models semantics approach , and extends it to cope with the URI sharing by harmonizing the local models via provenance agreement and possible commitment relationships . As compared to C OWL [ 1 ] , our approach has more flexibility , and fits in with the principle of Web architecture . In addition , our approach defines the complete commitment relationship as a special sub relation of commitment relationship to formalize the owl:import mechanism , in other words , our approach extends it to cope with more general distributed ontologies . However , more research work should be taken to deal with the reasoning issue within our semantic framework . Another work is to extend the OWL DL with some constructs representing the vocabulary provenance as well as the commitment relationship .
