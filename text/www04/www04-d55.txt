ABSTRACT This paper presents a method and a tool for publishing semantic web content in RDF(S ) for the humans as a static HTML page site . Categories and Subject Descriptors : H54 Information Systems : Hypertext/Hypermedia General Terms : Design Keywords : Semantic Web , ontology , logic , content publishing
1 . THE IDEA IN A NUTSHELL
Semantic portals1 are widely used for publishing dynamic semantic web content . This approach has , however , created publication obstacles from the viewpoint of content providers : 1 ) Only content of certain type conforming to the portal ’s application ontologies can usually be published . 2 ) The publication process is dependent on the organization maintaining the portal application . 3 ) Ordinary Internet Service Providers ( ISP ) do not allow ordinary users to run servers or provide semantic portal services for their customers . 4 ) Content publishers do not necessarily have the required technical skills to maintain semantic portals . 5 ) The portal may provide some of the content only in the “ hidden web ” which hinders Internet search engines such as Google from indexing some or all of the content . The notion of semantic portal is in these respects in contrast with the very idea of the current web , where everybody can publish content easily and independently by just maintaining HTML files in a public directory .
To address these publishing problems , we have developed a method and a tool “ Semantic Web HTML Generator ” ( SWeHG ) [ 4 ] for transforming RDF(S ) repositories into repositories of semantically indexed and mutually linked static HTML pages .
The input to SWeHG consists of HTML templates and an RDF repository conforming to a set of RDFS ontologies . In addition , the semantics of the tags need to be provided as Prolog predicates ( unless a suitable predicate set is already available ) . The output of SWeHG is a semantically linked space of HTML pages of the following kind : 1 ) Resource pages ( RPage ) depict selected resources with their metadata . For example , a photo with its metadata can be rendered as an RPage . 2 ) Index pages ( IPage ) classify RPages along conceptual hierarchical classifications , called facets or views [ 5 ] . By using IPages , RPages can be found along different facets . 3 ) A home page ( HPage ) defines the entrance page to the HTML repository .
For example , figure 1 presents the HPage of a photo exhibition

Figure 1 : A photo exhibition generated with SWeHG .
SWeHG generated for the Helsinki University Museum . On the left , two frames containing index views are seen : an alphabetical index and a classified index based on the concepts and subconcepts of an underlying RDFS ontology . In the frame on the right , a selected photo with its metadata and recommended links to related photos is rendered . The recommendation links are generated based on the underlying ontologies , photo metadata , and logical rules that define semantic recommendation relations between photos . For example , if a person is depicted in a photo , then links to photographs depicting her relatives can be generated with labels explaining the family relation in question . The museum can publish the exhibition by just copying the pages into a public HTML directory . The RDF repository and ontologies in this case were originally developed for a stand alone kiosk application . Using SWeHG the same content can be republished on the Semantic Web .
2 . TAG SEMANTICS IN LOGIC
SWeHG is based on descriptions on two levels : 1 ) The layout of the HTML pages is described on the HTML level by templates using custom tags . 2 ) The semantics of the tags is defined on the RDF level in terms of logical rules based on the input RDF(S ) content . The idea is that an HTML designer can design the layout of the page repository to be generated by using tags without knowing details of the underlying RDF structures , RDFS ontologies , and Prolog programming . RDF(S ) related knowledge as well as programming capability in Prolog is needed only for the system programmer when defining the tags . The same tags can be re used in applications conforming to similar ontological schemas .
SWeHG provides the HTML designer with three special tags : getProperty , getLinks , and getView . The tag <getProperty name=p> tag is used for rendering a label related to the resource underlying an RPage . For example , the metadata property values of the photo in figure 1 are rendered in this way . The relation p can be specified by the system programmer on the RDF level freely by a logical predicate .
The tag <getLinks> is used for rendering links between RPages .
For example , the tag
<swehg:getLinks name="SameLocation" listType="ul" listStyle="text size : 10;"/>
SWeHG also performs an analysis for the generated HTML pages and identifies the following potential problems : Self loops ( a link that points to the page itself ) , Bad links ( link pointing to a non existing page ) , Dead ends ( an RPage with no outbound links ) , No way in ( an RPage with no inbound links from any RPages or IPages ) , Not in index ( an RPage with no inbound links from any IPage ) , and Unused rules ( rules that are newer referred to when generating the HTML repository ) . This helps the designer in debugging the specifications . could expand into the following HTML code linking photographs taken at the same location :
3 . DISCUSSION
<ul style="text size : 10;">
<li><a href="entryMediacard_00071html">
View from Eiffel tower</a></li>
<li><a href="entryMediacard_00143html">
Cafe Parisienne</a></li>
</ul>
On the RDF level , the criterion SameLocation for the linkage could defined by the predicate below2 . It associates the attribute SameLocation with the HTML link label ’Same Place’ and the predicate photosWithSameLocation defining the link relation . swehg_relation_rule( ’SameLocation’ ,
’Same Place’ , photosWithSameLocation ) . photosWithSameLocation(Context , Target ) : photo(Context ) , photo(Target ) , rdf(Context , _:place , Location ) , rdf(Target , _:place , Location ) , not(Context == Target ) .
The tag <getView> renders into a hierarchical index like decomposition of category resources used in IPages . Each category is associated with a set of subcategories and additional individuals of the categories . A view is defined by specifying 1 ) the root resource selector , 2 ) a binary subcategory relation predicate , and 3 ) a binary relation predicate that maps the hierarchy categories with the individuals used as leaves in the view . For example , the tag
<swehg:getView roots="buildings" branches="subclass" leaves="photoOf" listType="ul" /> expands recursively into a hierarchical unordered tree ( ul ) , where the leaves are links to photo record resources related to different building categories . The predicate definitions defining meaning of the attribute values can be , for example , the following : buildings(URI ) : rdf(URI , rdf:type , ’http://someorg#building’ ) subclass(SubCategory , SuperCategory ) : rdf(SubCategory , rdfs:subClassOf , SuperCategory ) . photoOf(Class , Record ) : rdf(Instance , rdf:type , Class ) , rdf(Record , dc:subject , Instance ) .
Here buildings selects the class building as the view root , and the hierarchy is expanded along the rdfs:subClassOf property . The photoOf predicate relates each building type c of this tree with a set of photo record resources which are used as the leaf categories of c . These are presented as HTML links to the corresponding RPages . The view expansion into HTML can be controlled with the help of additional tag attributes for , eg , ordering the categories . 2The examples are presented in SWI Prolog ( http://wwwswiprologorg ) syntax . Here RDF triples are presented as rdf(Subject , Predicate , Object ) . Underscore “ _ ” is an unnamed variable .
Logic and dynamic link creation on the semantic web has been discussed , eg , in [ 2 , 1 ] . Our approach is different in it ’s use of HTML templates and Prolog for describing the static HTML output . In the RDF Twig tool3 the RDF to HTML transformation is based on XSLT . A problem here is that an RDF graph can be serialized in many ways in XML . In Spectacle4 the RDF to HTML transformation is based on APIs . Then the user must write programs that use the API , and also an application server is needed . In contrast , our approach is based on tags , is declarative , and the result is a set of static pages whose linkage structure is inferred by logical linking predicates .
Our initial experiences with SWeHG indicate that the presented approach is feasible . The idea of using logic and Prolog for defining the semantics of the tags seems powerful . Complicated semantic link relations and views can be defined and modified easily and declaratively . However , more work and testing is still needed in order to evaluate the usability of SWeHG and in determining what additional features may be needed in the system . More work is also needed in optimizing the efficiency of the code and in providing better development tools for the HTML designer and system programmer using the system . repository
A semantically linked HTML page generated by SWeHG can be tried out on the web at http://wwwcshelsinkifi/group/seco/swehg/ The RDF(S ) there comes from the MuseumFinland semantic portal [ 3 ] and contains 1200 objects from the museum collections of the Espoo City Museum in Finland .
