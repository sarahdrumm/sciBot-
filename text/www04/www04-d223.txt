ABSTRACT This paper proposes a novel approach to integrate heterogeneous data in P2P networks . The approach includes a tool for building P2P semantic link networks , mechanisms for peer schema mapping , criteria for peer similarity degree measurement , and algorithms for heterogeneous data integration . The approach has three advantages : First , it uses semantic links to describe semantic relationships between peers’ data schemas . Second , it deals with the semantic heterogeneity , the structural heterogeneity and the data value inconsistency . Finally , it considers the semantic similarity and structural similarity to forward queries to relevant peers .

INTRODUCTION Data integration in Peer to Peer systems is a challenging issue due to its heterogeneous and autonomous characteristic [ 2 ] . An approach to answer queries in P2P networks was proposed in [ 1 ] . However , the approach in [ 1 ] only considers attribute semantics of peers . The proposed approach is based on our previous work on semantic links , soft devices and semantic Web service integration [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] .
2 . GENERAL ARCHITECTURE Figure 1 denotes an overview of P2P semantic link networks , where each peer is an active and intelligent soft device [ 4 ] . Peers can dynamically establish connection and provide data and services to each other based on basic communication mechanisms . Semantic Links are used to specify semantic relationships locally between peers [ 3 ] . A P2P Semantic Link Network ( SLN ) is a directed network , where nodes are peers and edges are typed semantic links . A component based tool for making semantic links between peers has been developed . When a peer enters into

SLN
As depicted in Figure 2 , a peer in a P2P semantic link network mainly has two modules : a communication module and a data management module . Users can query a peer through GUI or SSeIQL — an SQL like query language designed for data management . Queries between peers are through SOAP messages .

Figure 2 . An overview of the proposed data integration approach .
Upon receiving a query , a peer will first check whether it can satisfy the requirement . If not , it will forward the query to its successors , who are likely to answer the query or forward the query further . Otherwise , the peer performs the following tasks :
334
Step 1 . Peer Schema Inquiry . To obtain peer schemas ( ie , the XML schema of the successors ) by sending Schema Inquiry messages . Step 2 . Schema Mapping . To build node mapping , path mapping and tree mapping between the current schema and peer schemas . Step 3 . Similarity Measurement . To measure semantic similarity and structural similarity between peers so as to select appropriate successors to forward the query . Step 4 . Consistency Maintenance . To detect inconsistent data in returned data flows . Step 5 . Data Integration . To integrate relevant data satisfying query requirements to provide users with a single semantic image data usage mode .
3 . P2P SEMANTIC LINK NETWORK MODEL In a P2P semantic link network , a semantic link between two peers Pi ( predecessor ) and Pj ( successor ) can be denoted as
P →α , where α is one of the following types : i
P j
( 1 ) Equal to Link  Semantics of Pi is equal to that of Pj ; ( 2 ) Similar to Link  Semantics of Pi is similar to that of Pj ; ( 3 ) Reference Link  Semantics of Pi refers to that of Pj ; ( 4 ) Empty Link  No semantic relationships between Pi and Pj ; ( 5 ) Null Link  Uncertain semantic relationships between Pi and Pj . We can chain relevant semantic links to obtain uncertain semantic relations between peers according to a set of reasoning rules [ 3 ] .
4 . DATA INTEGRATION 4.1 Peer Schema Mapping Upon receiving peer schemas through SOAP messages , a peer will traverse the schemas recursively in the depth first order to extract schema information . To solve the semantic heterogeneity , each node in a peer schema is associated with a semantic attribute set ( ie , a set of semantically related terms ) . Structural heterogeneity is solved through : ( 1 ) Node Mapping  To map nodes of the current schema into those of peer schemas ; ( 2 ) Path Mapping  To map label paths in the current schema into paths in peer schemas ; and ( 3 ) Tree Mapping  To transform the current schema as a tree into trees of peer schemas .
4.2 Peer Similarity Measurement A peer determines where to forward a query according to semantic similarity and structural similarity between the successors . The semantic similarity can be measured by cycle analysis , functional dependency analysis , etc . [ 1 ] . We define the structural similarity as : itself and

4.3 Heterogeneous Data Integration Within a predefined timeout , the peer initiating a query will analyze the data flows returned and integrate relevant data to answer the query . To solve the problem of data inconsistency , we take into consideration QoP ( ie , Quality of Peers ) , which focuses on user perceived qualities , such as response time , precision , recall , traffic overhead , etc . 5 . CONCLUSIONS The proposed approach provides a new way to integrate heterogeneous data in P2P semantic link networks , which incorporates the characteristic of P2P and semantic link network to provide users with a single semantic image data usage mode . 6 .
