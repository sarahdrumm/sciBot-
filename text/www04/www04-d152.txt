ABSTRACT In many Web search applications , similarities between objects of one type ( say , queries ) can be affected by the similarities between their interrelated objects of another type ( say , Web pages ) , and vice versa . We propose a novel framework called similarity spreading to take account of the interrelationship and improve the similarity calculation . Experiment results show that the proposed framework can significantly improve the accuracy of the similarity measurement of the objects in a search engine .

1 . INTRODUCTION Various applications in a search engine require a measurement of similarities between objects . One obvious example is to suggest related terms in interactive query expansion , which require the similarity calculation of query terms to other terms . Existing algorithms measure the similarity of objects based on the content features [ 1][2][4][5 ] or object interrelationship [ 3][6 ] . However , the influence of similarities between objects of one type on the similarities between objects of another type has not been taken into account . As shown in Figure 1 , the two types of objects are queries and Web pages . They are interrelated by click through relationships . It is obvious that , when we compute the similarity of the any two queries , the similarity of the corresponding Web pages should be considered . Meanwhile , when computing the similarity of the Web page , the similarity of the corresponding queries should be considered . The similarity of two objects of one type can propagate similarity of their respective interrelated objects of the other type through the mutual effect above . The propagated similarity also propagates similarity of the two original objects conversely .

In this paper , we propose a unified framework to calculate the similarities over the interrelated objects in a search engine . Under this framework , the intra type feature , the inter type feature and mutual effect of two types of similarity are considered . Besides , such process is iterative until the similarity converges to a stable state . 2 . ALGORITHM We model objects on the Web and their relationships as a directed graph G=(V , E ) , where nodes in V represent Web objects and edges E represent relationships between Web objects . In this paper , we consider V as consisting of two subsets Q= {q1 , q2 , … , qm} and P={p1 , p2 , … , pn} , where Q represents the query objects and P represents the Web page objects . Three kinds of relationships among the Web objects are studied in this paper , including Web page in link relationship ( IL ) , Web page out link relationship ( OL ) , and query page click through relationship ( CT ) . For any Web object v in G , the set of the adjacent objects which have any of the three relationships with the object v , is denoted as MR(v ) ( R represents the corresponding relationship ) . For example , MIL(v ) denotes the set of Web pages that contains hyperlinks leading to Web page v . Individual , where 1≤i≤|MR(v)| . objects in the set MR(v ) are denoted as Furthermore , we use S to denote a similarity matrix for objects ; thus , S[a,b ] is the similarity between objects a and b . In this section , we propose the a unified framework of similarity spreading algorithm , to calculate the similarity of different Web objects by utilizing different kinds of object relationships in a mutually reinforcing manner . The query similarities can be calculated as :

As shown in Eq 1 , the inter type similarity of the queries is affected by the similarity of Web pages via the click through relationship ( MCT ) . The similarity matrix ( SQ ) , for the current iterative result , is a linear combination of intra and inter type query similarity . Similarity of Web pages can be defined in a very similar fashion as :

The similarity of the queries is spread to the similarity of Web pages through the click through relationship ( MCT ) , and the similarity matrix ( SP ) , for the current iterative result , is a linear combination of intra and inter type Web page similarity . The similarity calculation can be continued iteratively until values converge . 3 . EXPERIMENTS We used a trace of query sessions from the MSN search engine that was collected in August , 2003 . It contains almost 1.2 million requests recorded over a period of three hours . We define a quantitative measure Precision to evaluate the performance of the algorithm . Given an object , the top 10 of similar objects as M is present to the user . Then ten volunteers were asked to identify which object is similar to the given object and the set N is the voting results we collected . The precision of the algorithm is defined as |N|/|M| . We do two types of experiments : one is to measure the performance of finding the similar queries and the other is to measure the performance of finding the related Web pages .

We compare several methods : our unified framework ( UF ) , content based method ( CB ) which is only based on the keywords , hyperlink based method ( HB ) which is only based on the hyperlink relationship , and query log based method ( QLB ) which is only based on the clickthrough data . For query similarity calculation , linear combination method ( LC ) is linear combination of CB and QLB , while for Web page similarity calculation , linear combination method ( LC ) is linear combination of HB and QLB . The comparison of 4 algorithms is shown in Figure 2 . The rightmost label “ AVG ” stands for the average value for the 10 queries . Our algorithm can improve the accuracy of similarity among the queries . The ten volunteers were also asked to evaluate the precision of the similarity calculation for the random selected 10 Web pages . The comparison of 4 algorithms is shown in Figure 3 . n o i s i c e r P
