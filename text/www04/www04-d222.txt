But neither the PageRank algorithm nor any of its improvements leverage these attributes . In this paper , we propose a novel link analysis algorithm “ the PowerRank algorithm ” , which makes use of the power law distribution attribute and the hierarchy structure of the web graph . The algorithm consists two parts . In the first part , special treatment is applied to the web pages with low “ importance ” score . In the second part , the global “ importance ” score for each web page is obtained by combining those scores together . Our experimental results show that : 1 ) The PowerRank algorithm computes 10%~30 % faster than PageRank algorithm . 2 ) Top web pages in PowerRank algorithm remain similar to that of the PageRank algorithm .

Introduction The PageRank algorithm [ 2 ] was developed to determine the importance of a web page by calculating the principle eigenvector of the web page ’s adjacency matrix . Due to the huge amount of pages in the Web , PageRank computing becomes a very time consuming job . Researchers have developed many technologies to speed up the page rank computation from different prospectives . Kamyar et , al , [ 4 ] exploits block structures of web to enhance PageRank computations . They computed local rank of pages of different domains separately and merged them together as a new starting value of PageRank computation . Arasu [ 1 ] suggested applying methods such as Multi grid , Gauss Seidel , successive overrelaxation method ( SOR ) on the web adjacency matrix to obtain the rank score vector . However , none of the tasks discussed above explored the hierarchy structure and the power law distribution of the web graph to help improve the calculation of PageRank . In this paper , we propose a novel link analysis algorithm which combines both above attributes to improve the page rank computation by Reducing the computational complexity ;

Keeping the order of top ranked pages similar to that of the
Reducing the probability of mult pages having same score . 2 . Web graphs and its power law distribution The web graph is proved to follow the power law distribution [ 3 ] . Using web page in degree as an example , the power law distribution can be explained as “ the number of web pages with in degree k is proportional to k β− ” . In the web graph that follows the power law distribution , the “ importance ” value of a webpage flows more easily from the low in degree pages to the high indegree ones . This leads to a larger conditional expectation value of the “ importance ” score , if the page has high in degree . Mathematically , we write it as the following theorems . Theorem : 1 ) For the ith node of a graph , ri is its “ popularity ” score form PageRank , and InDi is its in degree . n is the number of nodes in the graph , and M , Ni are constants ( see 2 ) ) . The conditional expectation value of its “ popularity ” score satisfies :

“ Pr(Pji>1/2 ) ” means that how many pages linked to ith page have low out degree . “ mink{Pr( )} ” means that how many pages have average “ popularity ” score in the final score vector . iMN Due to the power law distribution , Ni is large . The value of 20 n can be larger than average “ popularity ” score ( 1/n ) . 3 . The PowerRank Algorithm As the previous theorem revealed , high in degree pages have higher expectation for the “ importance ” score . From the result , we can deduce that low “ importance ” web pages are expected to have low in degree . If we take a special treatment on these pages , for example , cutting them off from the web graph , the web graph link structure will remain similar as before . Such treatment would then reduce the computing time and preserve the similar rank result . To identify the low ranked pages , we first rank the hosts or domain nodes of the web by their in degree . Then we cut off the low in degree hosts or domains . Pages located in such nodes ( hosts or domains ) are also cut off . The remaining nodes are continued to the next level of calculation for “ importance ” . Finally , those “ popularity ” scores for pages remained in the calculation , or the pages cut off from the calculation are combined
254 and Webpage . to form a global “ importance ” score . We name this method “ PowerRank ” algorithm . It is described in detail in the following : Suppose there are only three levels of web hierarchies : domain , host is http://wwwacmorg/indexhtml , its host URL is wwwacmorg , and its Domain URL is acmorg The PowerRank algorithm contains four steps : • First , PageRank algorithm is applied on domains . After

Suppose the several iterations , the low ranked domains are cut off .
• Second , PageRank is applied on hosts . Similar to the first step , after several iterations , the low ranked hosts are cut off . • Third , a similar calculation is applied on web pages , and lowranked pages are cut off . By our theorem , the structure of the remaining graph should be similar to that of the original web graph . Applying a ranking algorithm here will obtain a similarity rank order and save computing time .
• Finally , the global “ importance ” scores of the pages in the cut off hosts ( domains ) are calculated by multiplying their local PageRank scores with the scores of their nested hosts .
The advantages of PowerRank algorithm are : Advantage 1 The PowerRank algorithm introduces a new framework of computing the “ importance ” of the web pages . In this algorithm , the time complexity is significantly reduced compared to the traditional PageRank algorithm . Advantage 2 Our algorithm can be applied to any improvements on the PageRank algorithm that we introduced in the first section . 4 . Experiments 4.1 Experiment Setup We use a Web Page sub graph of the web ( denoted as AE ) to conduct our experiments . AE contains about 88 Million pages , 4.4 Million hosts , and 3.3 Million domains . To study the effects of different cut off criteria , we conduct six experiments . These experiments are represented with three percentage numbers : Different domains and host cutting off ratios are indicated in the first and second percentage numbers , while the third number indicates the percent of web pages left . These six experiments are 2% 2% 96 % , 4% 6% 90 % , 8% 12% 80 % , 10%20% 70 % , 15% 25% 60 % , 20% 30% 50 % , which are labeled as AEI , AEII , AEIII , AEIV , AEV and AEVI , respectively . 4.2 Results We compared the six experiments’ score vectors and the PageRank vector . Rank Vectors Comparison We record the L1 norm⊥ for the minus vector of original PageRank score vector and our score vectors . The comparison results are shown in Table 2 . The L1norm ranges from 0.11 to 063 Table 2 : L1 norm of minus vectors under different threshold Experiment Label AEI AEII AEIII AEIV

AEV AEVI Time Comparison We compare the computing time of AEI , AEIII and AEIV with the original PageRank algorithm . Results are shown in Figure 1 . The dotted bar is the ratio of remaining pages’ number to the total number of pages’ . The stripped bar is the ratio of remaining links’ number to the total number of links . The squared bar is the ratio of computing time to the original PageRank computing time . From Figure 1 we can find that the computing time of the PowerRank algorithm is less than that of the PageRank algorithm . In AEIII , the computation time reduced about 20 % . k n a R e g a P o t o i t a R

In their log log plots , we found that they fit the line y = x well . That means the PowerRank provides a similar ranking result to PageRank algorithm for top ranked pages . Low Rank Score Comparison Two pages with the same “ importance ” value in the final calculation results are called a tie . We compare the tie counts of PowerRank result and PageRank result in the lower 80 % pages . The tie counts in AEIV , AEV , and AEVI are less than that of PageRank . The tie counts of lower 15 % pages in AEII , AEIII are less than that of PageRank as well . 5 . Conclusion In this paper , we introduce the “ PowerRank ” algorithm , which takes the advantage of the power law distribution attribute and the hierarchy structure of the web graph . Our experimental results on this algorithm show that the PowerRank algorithm computes 10%~30 % faster than the PageRank algorithm . Moreover , the top ranked web pages in PowerRank algorithm remain very similar to those of the PageRank algorithm . Finally , it reduces the score “ ties ” in the final calculation results . 6 .
