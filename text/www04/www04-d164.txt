ABSTRACT The future Web can be imagined as a life network consisting of resource nodes and semantic relationship links between them . Any node has a life span from birth − adding it to the network − to death − removing it from the network . Through establishing and investigating two types of models for such a network , we obtain the same scale free distribution of semantic links . Simulations and comparisons validate the rationality of the proposed models .

1 . INTRODUCTION The future Web is a vision of a life network consisting of nodes representing versatile resources and edges symbolizing the semantic links or subnets connecting similar semantic resources . Each node has a life span from birth – adding it to the network – to death – removing it from the network . The value of a node ’s life can be reflected by the number of links it connects . For example , once the number of links connecting a node becomes zero  that means it is not reachable from other nodes , then the node can be regarded as dead and hence it could be removed from the network . Our notion is that a network model in which both creation and deletion operations coexist could better form a competitive environment : the more robust ( having much more connections to the environment ) , the more likely to survive , conversely , the less robust , the more likely to be eliminated . Some previous models addressed the concept of finite life span for nodes , but they only aim at adding nodes and links to the network , and the nodes are allowed to permanently exist . So they are not suitable for describing the future Web . Amaral suggests limiting the addition of new links on account of nodes’ life span or link capacity [ 1 ] . His model follows the growth constraint that new links no longer connect to it when a node reaches a certain age or has more than a critical number of links . Another case in point is

At each time step , number of links between sites is removed with equal probability . They have demonstrated that the permanent removing of links to a scale free network does not break the scaling behavior in a relatively wide range .
2 . URN TRANSFER MODEL FOR FUTURE WEB The urn transfer model can be regarded as a series of urns contain balls having pins attached to them [ 4 ] . We assume a countable number of urns , urnk , k = 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , … , where each ball in urnk has kF t be the number of balls in urnk . p k pins attached to it . Let be the expected value of adding a new ball into urn0 , p’ be the delete factor andαbe non preferential factor . Then , at each time step one of two kinds of behaviors may occur in this model : ( ⅰ ) add a new ball having no pins attached into urn0 with the probability :

In the boundary case , k=0 , one ball is either removed out of the urn0 with probability or transfer to urn1 with after attaching a pin to it . Consequently , for probability k>0 , we have the following expected value of . kE F t + = ( ( 1 ) ) kF t + F t ( ) − k 1 p add

3 . DIRECTED EVOLVING GRAPH FOR FUTURE WEB The urn transfer model , however , cannot directly reflect the concept of web for not simultaneously considering both incoming and outgoing links . The Web can be described as a directed evolving graph G=(N , E ) , where N is the node set and E is the link set . Let Fi,j(t ) be the expected numbers of nodes with i incoming semantic links ( ie in degree ) and j outgoing semantic links ( ie α are the non preferential out degree ) at time step t . out factors for in degree and out degree respectively . At each time step , one of two kinds of operations for nodes and links may occur in the graph : ( i ) with probability p , a new unlinked node is introduced . ( ii ) with probability ( 1 p)(1 p’ ) , a node is chosen . Then , the node is to receive a new incoming α )Fi,j(t ) , semantic link with the probability proportional to ( i+ in or the node is to be deleted a outgoing semantic link with the α )Fi,j(t ) . By employing rate probability proportional to ( j+ out equation approach , we can obtain the joint distribution Fi,j(t ) [ 3 ] : dF i j , dt

Therefore , we found the in and out degree distributions evolve in α the same manner except the difference of the factor in α , which reflects the fact that the governing rules of this and out model are symmetric . Hence it is safe to say that both the incoming and outgoing links share the same evolving trend of the degree distribution and the only difference lies in the values of non preferential factors . By means of deduction , we yield the same approximate resolution as that of urn transfer model
4 . EXPERIMENTS AND ANALYSIS Figure 1 show the two groups of comparisons for the in degree distribution . The parameters are derived from the Web graph model [ 3 ] : ( a ) p=0.125 , α=0.75 and p’=0.01and ( b ) p=0.125 ,
α=0.75 and p’=01 The solid lines are results from numerical simulations with 106 time steps and points are approximate resolutions . The two curves are basically consistent . It becomes conscious that the smaller for the value of link deleting factor p’ , the more similar between two curves . Figure 2 show the comparisons for the out degree distribution . ( a ) is for p=0.125 , α=3.55 and p’=0.1 , while ( b ) is for p=0.125 , α=3.55 and p’=02 Through comparison , we obtain the same conclusion as that of in degree distribution .
5 . CONCLUSION In this paper , we propose two different modeling measures for the future Web and deduced an asymptotic formula to describe the distribution of the semantic links . Considering the simplification we have made , the approximate resolution may be not accurate enough . Then , we have also implemented a simulation with 106 time steps to mimic such a dynamic evolution process . Comparisons show the approximate resolution is consistent with our model in general . The proposed model can be used to evaluate future web ’s experimental data sets [ 5 ] .
