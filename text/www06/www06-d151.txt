ABSTRACT The web crawler space is often delimited into two general areas : full web crawling and focused crawling . We present netSifter , a crawler system which integrates features from these two areas to provide an effective mechanism for webscale crawling . netSifter utilizes a combination of page level analytics and heuristics which are applied to a sample of web pages from a given website . These algorithms score individual web pages to determine the general utility of the overall website . In doing so , netSifter can formulate an indepth opinion of a website ( and the entirety of its web pages ) with a relative minimum of work . netSifter is then able to bias the future efforts of its crawl towards higher quality websites , and away from the myriad of low quality websites and crawler traps that litter the World Wide Web .

INTRODUCTION
There are numerous challenges facing today ’s web crawlers . The Internet has reached such proportions that a crawler can neither be expected to scan the Web in its entirety , nor refresh all content in a timely manner . Content of questionable merit has proliferated , and in an effort to conserve constrained resources such as bandwidth , processing time and storage , a crawler must avoid such content while directing its efforts toward the discovery of higher value content , and refreshing known good content .
We implemented netSifter within IBM ’s WebFountain [ 3 ] to counter the challenges faced by current crawler methodologies . netSifter is a scalable , flexible architecture that approaches the Web as a collection of websites , so as to avoid fiWork done at IBM Almaden Research Center .

The unique concept of the solution is to rank the URL frontier by making page level judgements based on knowledge of the originating site . This site knowledge is created by performing various analyses on a sample of pages from the site , and subsequently formulating an overall site score . Future pages from the site can then be prioritized in relation to other pages via the site score . The rationale for this idea is that pages from a common site are related , and share characteristics indicative of quality . netSifter is extensible to varied needs , allowing it to take advantage of both modern focused crawling techiques [ 1 ] and full web crawling strategies [ 2 ] . For example , netSifter can make use of relatively expensive content based analyses while remaining scalable , since only a sample of pages from a site are examined . Additionally , netSifter can make simplified use of popularity measures by , for example , examining outlinks from the sample set of web pages , or by incorporating link based ranking results into the site scores periodically . Since netSifter employs a plurality of analysis techniques , a website is not excluded or included based on any one metric .
2 . SYSTEM DETAILS 2.1 Architecture
The architecture is divided into two stages : online and offline analysis . The online analysis stage is comprised of the scheduler and the online analysis manager . These components direct the crawl , and route pages to offline analysis . The offline analysis stage contains a UIMA [ 4 ] analytics chain which performs more extensive content inspection and analysis in order to generate site scores . This analytics chain can be distributed across many nodes via a serviceoriented architecture , and is able to run independently and asychronously with respect to the main crawling process . The individual components are described below . ffl Site Score Database The site score database serves as the link between the online and offline analysis stages , where online analysis queries for site scores in order to prioritize the URL frontier , and offline analysis generates or updates them . Site scores represent the relative value of a site compared to any other site . ffl Scheduler The crawler perpetually iterates over a list of all URLs that have been discovered or seeded . The list is retrieved in batches , and each URL in the batch is given a score based on its website ’s score . The batch unbiased netSifter

Asian sites indicates that some annotators improperly handle non English content . netSifter correctly scored spam and adult content sites , even though these sites were rated well by SiteRank . Among the bottom 1000 SiteRank scores , 373 sites were scored positively by netSifter . Manual examination of these sites rated a large majority as postive . This shows that netSifter was able to identify interesting sites which were not well connected .
The second experiment compares a netSifter crawler against an unbiased crawler . The utility of the crawlers was measured using ODP Utility ( the count of pages crawled from sites which appear in the ODP listings , ODP Utility ( Weighted ) ( the sum of the number of pages crawled from a given site multiplied by the number of site appearances in the ODP , and SiteRank Utility ( the number of pages crawled from a given site multipled by the SiteRank of that site . The results are shown in Table 1 . Though netSifter crawled fewer pages than the unbiased crawl , it outperformed it on ODP Utility ( Weighted ) and SiteRank Utility . netSifter demonstrates that by exploiting the logical association of a web page to a website , and then forming an estimate of the overall quality of a website , the URL frontier of a web scale crawler can be effectively prioritized to bias the crawler towards higher quality content . 4 .

0 is sorted by score in descending order , and then sent to the fetcher . The fetcher is allocated a time period in which to fetch as many URLs as possible , though it is generally not able to exhaust a given list . If a site score does not exist , a slightly higher than neutral score is assigned , as unscored sites are favored for their potential to contain novel content . ffl Online Analysis Manager In addition to being sent to the main system for storage and indexing , all newly fetched pages are routed to the online analysis manager , which determines whether or not a page should be sent to the offline analysis stage . If a page is empty , contains any \soft" errors , or fails other basic datavalidity tests , it is discarded . A page is sent offline if no site score for the page exists , or if a sufficient period of time has elapsed since a site score was produced . ffl Offline Analytics Chain The offline analytics chain passes a page through various annotators , each of which scores the page based on various algorithms . The final annotator in the chain combines the individual scores into a weighted average and applies optional heuristics . The final page score is then stored temporarily in a database . Once a sufficient sample of pages for a site have been collected , those page scores are aggregated and submitted to the site score database .
2.2 Sampling Method netSifter employs a sampling method to determine that a sufficient sample has been collected from a site . It is assumed that the sample a crawler generates consists of independent and identically distributed pages . A sufficient sample is defined as being a sample which produces a pagescore mean x which represents the population mean within ffi at a confidence level of 95 % using a standard t test .
We require a website to pass the t test for three sequential observations in order to provide an opportunity for the crawl to move past locally consistent content , and find a better estimate of the mean for the entire site . A maximum sample size is set to avoid analyzing too many pages for websites which are unable to produce a consistent site score within a reasonable sample size .
3 . RESULTS AND CONCLUSION
To validate that netSifter accurately measures site quality , we compared website scores to SiteRank ( a site level variant of PageRank ) scores . A list of corresponding netSifter and SiteRank scores for sites was produced , and sorted in descending order of SiteRank score . Sites were grouped into buckets , and counts of netSifter scores greater than , equal to , and less than 0 were generated . The results can be seen in Figure 1 . There is a positive correlation between higher netSifter scores and site connectedness .
Among the top 1000 SiteRank scores , 148 sites were scored negatively by netSifter . There were many Asian language , spam , link farm , and adult content sites . The presence of
