ABSTRACT In this paper we introduce our multi metamodel process ontology ( m3po ) , which is based on various existing reference models and languages from the workflow and choreography domain . This ontology allows the extraction of arbitrary choreography interface descriptions from arbitrary internal workflow models . We also report on an initial validation : we translate an IBM Websphere MQ Workflow model into the m3po ontology and then extract an Abstract BPEL model from the ontology .

INTRODUCTION
Organisations have long used process modelling to describe the dynamic behaviour of their business . Workflow Management Systems ( WfMSs ) are commonly applied for process modelling and allow to describe and execute business processes . With the advent of Service Oriented Computing organisations started to expose their business functionality explicitly as reusable and composable services . To interact with these services organisations offer choreography interfaces , stating conversational patterns in which the services can be consumed .
A fundamental lack in current choreography frameworks such as Abstract BPEL and WS CDL is the disconnection between external choreography interfaces and internal workflow descriptions . Conceptually , a choreography interface can be regarded as an abstracted view on a business process ( cf [ 2 , 7 , 1] ) , but current choreography frameworks ignore this dependency relation . A major obstacle in connecting internal processes and external choreographies is the variety in existing workflow languages , workflow metamodels , and choreography languages [ 8 ] . Directly translating from workflow languages to choreography languages would require n2 mappings , for each combination of workflow and choreography language .

Figure 1 describes our approach to connect workflows and choreography descriptions . We develop an intermediate unifying workflow ontology that can represent arbitrary workflows , thus reducing the amount of required mappings to 2n . This ontology can be used to represent internal process models , and from the ontology choreography interfaces ( corresponding to the internal process model ) can be extracted .

2 . ONTOLOGY
The multi metamodel process ontology ( m3po ) is based on two principles : to incorporate and unify the different existing workflow metamodels and workflow reference models , and to provide the necessary properties for extracting choreographies from internal business processes . To facilitate the extraction of the external view on a workflow the m3po allows a workflow engineer to mark the visibility of tasks to different collaboration roles . Thus multiple views on the underlying workflow model can be extracted .
For the integration of workflow models the m3po is organised around the five key workflow aspects [ 4 ] widely recognised as essential workflow characteristics . We have combined the most elaborate existing reference metamodels per aspect in our ontology . The target of our ontology are choreography specification languages such as WS CDL or Abstract BPEL . Thus we further extended the m3po with choreography specific information . The choreography related concepts provided in the m3po are a superset of the modelling primitives offered in these languages .
Our hypothesis is that constructing the ontology through a careful analysis of existing reference models and workflow languages , guarantees the representational width of the ontology , ie that all existing workflow models can be represented and all existing choreography interfaces can be extracted from it .

The behavioural semantics in the ontology are defined similarly to the one of the PSL ontology [ 6 ] with occurrence graphs , which are isomorphic to substructures of the situation tree from situation calculus . Given the space limitations , we only display the key concepts of the ontology in a UML class diagram ; a thorough description of the full ontology can be found at : http://wwwm3peorg/deliverables/process ontologypdf

3 . VALIDATION
To validate our hypothesis we first need to show that indeed all metamodels can be represented , and then that arbitrary choreography interfaces can be extracted . We report on an initial result , namely the mapping from one WfMS ( IBM Websphere MQ Workflow ) into our ontology , and the mapping to one choreography language ( Abstract BPEL ) , as shown in figure 3 . ography specific concepts and denoted the visibility of tasks to specific collaboration roles . Finally we mapped from this extended internal workflow represented according to our ontology1 to an Abstract BPEL description2 .
4 . RELATED WORK
Our work is most closely related to several approaches to views on process models . Chebbi et al . [ 1 ] propose a view model with cooperative activities that can be partially visible for different partners , but the approach requires n2 mappings and does not consider data ( message transfer ) . Chiu et al . [ 2 ] present a meta model that includes crossorganisational communications . The approach is specific to one workflow modelling tool , and does not offer integrated choreography extraction . Schulz and Orlowska [ 7 ] introduce a state transition approach that binds states of private workflow tasks to a corresponding view task ; they do not describe how to integrate different workflow models , and abstract the data aspect completely . Sayal et al . [ 5 ] introduce service activities ( that represent trade partner interaction ) as workflow primitives . Their approach is specific to one workflow modelling tool and addresses neither workflow integration nor choreography interface extraction .
5 . CONCLUSION
We have presented the multi meta model process ontology ( m3po ) . It is unique in the combination of workflow primitives and support for choreography specific concepts . It can act as connecting ontology to integrate workflow models and allows choreography interface extraction . We showed that one can straightforwardly generate a complete and correct Abstract BPEL interface from the annotated m3po ontology in an example validation . To further verify the hypothesis that any process model can be mapped to the m3po , more work is still required on the construction of mappings from the WfMSs and choreography languages to our ontology .
