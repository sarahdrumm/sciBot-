ABSTRACT The use of Semantic Web Service ( SWS ) technologies have been suggested to enable more dynamic B2B integration of heterogeneous systems and partners . We present how we add semantics to RosettaNet specifications to enable the WSMX SWS environment to automate mediation of messages . The benefits of applying SWS technologies include flexibility in accepting heterogeneity in B2B integrations .

INTRODUCTION
RosettaNet1 is one widely used XML based e business framework . Due to the flexibility in RosettaNet regarding e.g message details means that considerable effort is required to ensure the B2B integration details match [ 5 ] . Therefore , B2B integrations suffer from long setup times and high costs .
Semantic Web Services ( SWS ) have been proposed to achieve more dynamic partnerships [ 1 ] . The SWS approach based on eg OWL S [ 4 ] or Web Service Modeling Ontology ( WSMO ) [ 6 ] enables annotation of the B2B integration interfaces with semantic information . This allows automatic or semi automated mediation . composition , and selection capabilities of services .
In addition , SWS enables powerful discovery ,
RosettaNet is widely used in B2B integration , but it is not yet based on SWS technologies . We believe that SWS technologies are introduced stepwise to integration rather than in a big bang . So to support integration we want to use SWS with the current RosettaNet . This SWS solution proposal is based on the Web Service Modelling eXecution environment ( WSMX ) [ 3 ] . WSMX is a reference implementation of WSMO and operates on the Web Service Modeling Language ( WSML ) [ 2 ] . In this paper , we concentrate on how we lift existing RosettaNet information to WSML and discuss its expected benefits . We further position our approach to other related work .

2 . ONTOLOGISING ROSETTANET
RosettaNet defines Partner Interface Process ( PIP ) messages using either DTDs and additional message guidelines or XML Schemas . WSMX operates only on WSML language and therefor translating XML used in RosettaNet from/to WSML is needed .
Domain ontologies are needed for the RosettaNet PIP messages used . We call this ontologising . Specific tools can be used to allow semi automated translation eg from XML Schemas to WSML , but it also requires an expert who understands RosettaNet and the capabilities of ontology languages to be able to capture information in messages semantically . As an example of ontologising , the RosettaNet Partner Interface Process ( PIP ) 3A1 supports two different kinds of product identifiers . Global Trade Identification Number ( GTIN ) is recommended by RosettaNet for product identifiers , but also the use of company specific identifiers is allowed . The extract in listing 1 shows the definition of product identifiers in the PIP 3A1 .
<!ELEMENT ProductIdentification
( GlobalProductIdentifier ? , PartnerProductIdentification∗)>
<!ELEMENT GlobalProductIdentifier(#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT PartnerProductIdentification
( GlobalPartnerClassificationCode , ProprietaryProductIdentifier , revisionIdentifier?)>
<!ELEMENT ProprietaryProductIdentifier ( #PCDATA)>
Listing 1 : PIP 3A1 DTD extract
RosettaNet message guidelines for PIP 3A1 contain a natural language constraint for ProductIdentification that the DTD ’s expressive power does not capture : Constraint : One instance of either ” GlobalProductIdentifier ” or ” PartnerProductIdentification ” is mandatory . Without this constraint , a valid ProductIdentification could be without any identifiers as both identifications are optional . There are newer XML Schema based PIPs , eg 3A4 , which contain the same information and can express the cardinality constraint . However , XML Schema uses different element names to the ones in DTDs as shown in listing 2 .
<xs:choice><xs:element ref= ” ulc:AlternativeIdentifier ” maxOccurs= ” unbounded ” ></xs:element>
<xs:element ref= ” udt:GTIN ” ></xs:element></xs:choice>
Listing 2 : PIP 3A4 XML Schema extract
The product identifier information in WSML is presented in listing 3 . Here the GTIN is handled as any other identification qualifier ( qualificationAgency ) and thus both the RosettaNet DTD and XML can be represented in the ontol ogy including the cardinality constraints . The qualification agency can be eg buyer ’s , seller ’s or manufacturer ’s identifier or some other identification scheme used . This qualification agency reflects the way that other standards , such as EDI X12 , address product identifiers making it easier to use the same product ontology in other B2B integrations . The axiom in listing makes sure that the value of qualificationAgency is among the known . concept productIdentification nonFunctionalProperties dc#description hasValue ” The collection of business properties that describe identifier information regarding products . ” endNonFunctionalProperties productIdentifier ofType ( 1 1 ) string qualificationAgency ofType ( 1 1 ) string axiom qualificationAgencyConstraint nonFunctionalProperties dc#description hasValue ” The valid list of agencies who have defined product identifiers . Can be companies or name of global idenfitifications eg EN=European Article Number ( EAN ) ” endNonFunctionalProperties definedBy !− ?x[qualificationAgency hasValue ?type ] and ( ?type = ” GTIN ” or ?type = ” Manufacturer ” or ?type = ” Buyer ” or ?type = ” EN ” ) .
Listing 3 : Product ontology extract in WSML
The mapping rules should be defined for run time mediation of ontologies . By knowing that a GTIN identifier and company specific identifiers point to the same product , the mediation can perform the required transformation to an identifier understood by the given partner . Finding the mappings is facilitated by the data mediation tool included in the Web Services Modeling Toolkit 2 .
3 . EXPECTED BENEFITS
As WSML is more expressive language than the schema languages used currently , the lifting of PIPs to ontologies can contain more information . As a simple example , we provided the mapping of product information to ontologies that captured also current natural language constraints .
The use of formal ontologies enables using common conversion functions to mediate some differences with logical dependencies . RosettaNet currently defines more than 300 GlobalProductUnitOfMeasureCodes as a list without any relations to each other . With help of logical relationships , automatic transformations between eg ” 25 Kilogram Bulk Bag ” and ” 50 Pound Bag ” can be done . Currently matching all the details related to PIP messages is a long process without any automation and any small differences can cause additional system development . SWS techniques can be used to describe how companies use the PIPs messages and this can be used for automatic message compatibility matching and making integration processes quicker . The resulting integration is also more flexible to slightly varying use of messages . Furthermore , the ontologies provide the basis for discovery , composition and selection of services .
4 . RELATED WORK
Preist et al . [ 5 ] presented a concept of mediating between EDI ( EDIFACT ) and RosettaNet messages but did not provide details on the benefits of ontologysing of messages .
2http://sourceforge.net/projects/wsmt
Trastour et al . [ 8 ] augment RosettaNet PIPs with partnerspecific DAML+OIL constraints to determine if parties have compatible messages , and automatically propose modifications if not . Trastour et al . [ 7 ] have also presented how to use agent communication to help in negotiation and contract forming processes for making B2B integration faster . These papers discussed similar benefits for B2B integration but where more about the matching the B2B interfaces rather than showing the benefits of ontologysing the messages used .
5 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We presented how we add semantics to existing RosettaNet messages to enable automated mediation of the differences in B2B integrations . The existing RosettaNet XML messages are lifted to WSML ontology language that can capture the meaning of RosettaNet messages and later use that for making the automated mediation .
This ontologysing is a part of the scenario that we are implementing based on WSMX Semantic Web service environment . We also plan to pinpoint more benefits of using formal ontology languages and provide formal partner interface descriptions that could be used for automatically matching the compatibility of two companies . Furthermore , real data from existing B2B integrations will be used to validate our approach .
