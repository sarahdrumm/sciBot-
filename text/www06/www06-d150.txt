ABSTRACT As part of the Language Observatory Project [ 4 ] , we have been crawling all the web space since 2004 . We have collected terabytes of data mostly from Asian and African ccTLDs . In this paper , we present results of the current status of the African web and compare it with its status in 2004 and 2002 . This paper focuses on the accessibility of the web pages , the web tree growth , web technology , privacy protection , and web interconnection .

1 . INTRODUCTION The Language Observatory was planned primarily to provide means for assessing the usage level of each language in cyberspace . Using UbiCrawler [ 2 ] , a scalable fully distributed web crawler developed for use in the project , we have collected a total of 84.6 million web pages from more than 142 thousand subdomains of 60 country code Top Level Domains ( ccTLDs ) of Africa . The information downloaded by the crawler is enormous , and only a small portion of it is presented in this paper . This endeavor has proven individuals and organizations conducting research and developing solutions on bridging the digital divide , such as UNESCO and ACALAN ( African Academy of Languages ) . to be beneficial to
2 . SURVEY STATISTICS During our most recent crawling , in December 2005 , we have collected 84.6 million pages from the whole of Africa , among them South Africa alone occupies more than 80 % . The growth of the pages during the last three years reached as high as 251.17 % per year . Due to the space limitation , the paper picks up only a few findings from the survey . For more detailed survey statistics data , refer to the project website [ 5 ] .

Top Level Domains with network related problems are Somalia and Guinea Bissau , from which all pages were unavailable during the experiment . On the other hand , pages stored on the web servers registered in Benin , Gambia , and Libyan Arab Jamahiriya maintained a high success rate of 9599 % even as their number of pages stored in the web server increased by almost 50 % in a year . Coincidentally , responses to requests of web pages from Mali and Djibouti web spaces had similar high success rates , their number of pages with even more increases at 75 % and 137 % , respectively . There was almost no problem in downloading pages from the web space of the following African countries : Democratic Republic of Congo , Reunion Island , Eritrea , Burundi , Seychelles , and Rwanda .
2.2 Web Tree Growth There is a complete freedom in how Africa ’s ccTLDs allocate their sub domains . We are analyzing how the African web tree is organized . As an example , during our experiment , Morocco topped the list with 801 second level sub domains , followed by Sao Tome & Principe and Senegal with 353 and 315 second level sub domains , respectively . On the other hand , Mozambique and Nigeria had no change in their number of second level subdomains from 2004 to 2005 . Out of the 142 thousand domains which our crawler has visited in the African web space , Libyan Arab Jamahiriya ’s number of domains multiplied 5 times in a period of 1 year , which indicates an exponential growth of the internet in the region . At the same time , the current domain count for Gambia almost doubled compared to the previous year ’s count . Almost all countries had increases in their number of domains , except for some special cases like Somalia and Guinea Bissau .
2.3 Open Source vs Proprietary Technology A report about the African web in 2002 [ 1 ] showed that 56 % of the websites use Microsoft technology . However , in the current survey , Microsoft served in only 22.82 % of the pages . With the decrease , it became second only to Apache ( 71.47% ) , which formerly occupied 37.95 % of the African market .

Table 2 shows that the global trend of preference to Apache like open source server software applies to whole Africa . A large number of pages were created by freely available PHP technology ( 55.96 % ) as compared to Microsoft ’s Active Server Pages ( ASP , 1536 % ) On the contrary , the 2002 report indicated ASP as the most common file type .

2.4 Persistent and Session Cookie Usage Monitoring the use of cookies and pointing to their inappropriate use can help protect the privacy of users from abuse [ 3 ] . The survey showed that Africa had a low rate of 18.73 % of persistent cookies and a relatively high rate of session cookies ( 4291 % ) One possible interpretation of this contradictory fact could be that there are not many e commerce servers that tend to intensively use persistent cookies to monitor web surfing patterns of the users ( typically shown in the case of Saint Helena , one of web hosting server domain ) . There could also be a few commercial servers that don’t use session cookies .

2.5 Interconnection The interconnection of the countries of Africa was analyzed through the number of outgoing links from each downloaded web page , where the total number of outgoing links is 3.9 billion . We are interested not only in the internal links ( links to the web pages within the African ccTLDs ) , but also the external links ( links to web pages outside the African ccTLDs ) . All the countries , except British Indian Ocean Territories and Zambia , had a high rate of internal interconnection . British Indian Ocean Territories had more links to .com ( 53.04 % ) domain , while Zambia had 42.62 % of its links distributed among the generic TLDs . For all TLDs of com net org uk ru de jp others

CONCLUSION In this paper , we outlined the status of the African web , how it is growing and adapting to the WWW bandwagon , and which countries are experiencing difficulties . In terms of server technologies , the global trend from proprietary technologies to open source technologies is observed in Africa too . Also , we have indicated the profile of servers and users through the analysis of cookie usage of the servers . The analysis of interconnection of African web has shown that African web is mostly connected within its country domain , and only a few outgoing links goes outside of Africa . The African web is not well connected with outside world . On our website [ 5 ] any interested reader can find additional data which were not possible to include in this paper due to the space limitations .
