ABSTRACT A map is one of the most useful media in disseminating spatial information . As mobile devices are becoming increasingly powerful and ubiquitous , new possibilities to access map information are created . However , mobile devices still face severe constraints that a mobile map application may offer . We present the m CHARTIS system , a device independent mobile map application that enables mobile users to access map information from their device .

1 . INTRODUCTION People want spatial information to be available anywhere and anytime . The progress in the field of mobile communications and mobile devices , which was achieved during the last years allowed the development of map applications , addressed to the users of handheld devices . Several map applications for mobile devices have been developed following different approaches . The most popular approach is the client side approach . In this case the user is required to download the application to his mobile device in order to use it . All these applications fail in one point . They are not device independent . They are designed either for mobile phones or for PDAs , but not for both . Sometimes they may require a JAVA enabled device or an i mode device . Moreover , very often the user is required to

We present a web based device independent mobile map application : the m CHARTIS system . It is designed in a way so that it can be accessed by a wide range of mobile devices , a fact that makes it device independent . It is consisted by two parts . The first part is used by the administrator of the system , providing him/her with the possibility to import information to the system and requires the use of desktop computer . The second part , which is specially designed for mobile devices , allows the mobile user to access the maps and the information that the administrator has imported in the system . We will focus on the mobile application . 2 . DEVICE INDEPENDENCE Mobile devices , in contrast to personal computers , are constrained by important limitations that impose severe difficulties to the interaction with the user [ 1][2 ] . Screen size , resolution , number of colors , limited computing power , storage space , low data transfer rates and important constraints . Although handheld devices are constantly improving technologically , the developers of applications addressed to mobile users should take into account these constraints . Concerning our application , we have chosen the web based approach ( simple web pages ) , so that the storage and processing of data takes place at the server ’s side . In this way we deal with the limitations of low processing power and low storage capability of devices . Furthermore , any mobile device that is equipped with a browser , a feature that nowadays almost all devices offer , can use our application , as all pages are XHTML Mobile Profile valid . XHTML MP [ 4 ] is a subset of XHTML , specifically designed for mobile devices and it is a standard proposed by Open Mobile Alliance . In addition , using the application does not depend on the connection service to the Internet . The pages are also designed to have the smallest possible size . For example , the page in which the map is presented , when the size of the map image is 176x220 ( typical for a smartphone ) is around 9 KB . When the size of the map image is 128x160 ( typical for a mobile phone ) the page is around 6 KB . With this feature we deal with the constraint of low data transfer rates of the network and the pages can be accessed even from devices with limited memory . In addition , we also minimize the cost of accessing the page . Finally , thanks to the possibility of changing the size and the zoom level of the map , the user is able to adapt the application according to his/her device screen capabilities .
In order to confirm that our mobile application is indeed device independent , we have tested it with different devices that cover all categories and have different capabilities such as mobile phones , smartphones and PDAs . 3 . THE m CHARTIS MOBILE APPLICATION The web based application , which is addressed to mobile users , allows them to access the maps and the information that has been imported in the system .
Figure 1 . The page for mobile users where the map is presented ( screenshots from Qtek 8020 smartphone )
In the main page the user selects one of the available cities and next he/she proceeds to the city ’s index page . From there he/she may choose to read general information for the city . Another option is “ map navigation ” . The user may start navigating from several pre specified points ( startpoints ) . After choosing one of them , the browser loads the page with the map centered at the respective point . This page is shown in figure 1 . The default size of the map image is 128x160 pixels , but the user may change it according to his device ’s display capabilities . There are also four zoom levels to select the one that suites her/him best . If the user changes once the zoom level or the size of the image , the application will “ remember ” the new settings . In this way she/he does not have to re enter these settings again . Moreover , keys 2,4,6,8 function as acceskeys and allow moving up , left , right and down on the map respectively . In case the device does not support accesskeys , navigation on the map is alternatively accomplished with the respective links .
Finally , there is also the possibility to display all the points that belong to a specific category . Another option available in each city ’s index page is “ search point ” . The user may search either for all points that belong to a specific category ( eg museum ) or for a specific point . In the last case the search criterion is the point ’s title . If there are any results found , the user , after selecting one of them , is transferred to the page in which a map with the point and the registered information are presented . In this case , there is also the possibility to change the size and the zoom level of the map and to navigate through it . The last option available in the city ’s index page is “ search street ” . The system uses for the query the name of the street which the user is searching for . If this street is found in the geographic data files for this city , the system splits it in segments and presents as options those segments that are closer to startpoints , so that the user may see the map with the respective segment of the street . This approach is followed because a street may extent to a long length and we want the user to be able to see the parts of the street that belong to different regions . We have designed all pages of the application for mobile users according to the design guidelines for mobile web pages described in [ 3 ] . We use the same style for all pages . Each page is divided in discrete parts : at the top of the page there is the part with the main informational content ; finally , the part with the input forms . In general , all pages are small so that scrolling is avoided . Each page also has a representative title , so that the user knows which part of the application is accessing . Finally , the entering text method is automatically changing to the appropriate type . For example , if a form requires numerical input , the input of the device is automatically changing to numerical ( when this functionality is supported by the device and the browser ) . This feature helps the user to save time and makes the application more functional . the navigation links ; then , the part with
4 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK We outlined the m CHARTIS system , a web based device independent mobile map application . We aimed , through this application , to provide the user with the possibility to navigate through maps and to access the information registered in the system . We emphasized on device independence , as current applications for mobile devices do not take into consideration this important , in our opinion , point . In the future we intend to perform an evaluation and user assessment of our application in order to determine its weaknesses and try to improve them . 5 .
