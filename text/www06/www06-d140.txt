ABSTRACT We present methods for finding experts ( and their contact details ) using e mail messages . We locate messages on a topic , and then find the associated experts . Our approach is unsupervised : both the list of potential experts and their personal details are obtained automatically from e mail message headers and signatures , respectively . Evaluation is done using the e mail lists in the W3C corpus .

INTRODUCTION
E mail has become the primary means of communication in many organizations . It is a rich source of information that could be used to improve the functioning of an organization . Hence , search and analysis of e mail messages has drawn significant interest from the research community [ 5 , 2 ] .
Specifically , e mail messages can serve as a source for “ expertise identification ” [ 1 ] , since they capture people ’s activities , interests , and goals in a natural way .
While early approaches to expert finding ( ie , identifying experts on a given topic ) employed manually maintained databases , there has been a move towards unsupervised methods that use expertise indicators from documents produced within an organization ; the resulting evidence of expertise is then used to build an employee ’s expertise profile .
Our main aim in this paper is to study the use of e mail messages for mining expertise information . Our main findings are that ( i ) the fielded structure of e mail messages can be effectively exploited to find pieces of evidence of expertise , which can then be successfully combined in a language

The rest of the paper is structured as follows . In Section 2 we detail and assess our model of expert search . In Section 3 we harvest contact details for candidates by mining e mail signatures . We conclude in Section 4 .
2 . FINDING EXPERTS
We model the expert finding task as follows : what is the probability of a candidate ca being an expert given the query topic q ? Instead of computing this probability p(ca|q ) directly , we can use Bayes’ Theorem to rank candidates in proportion to p(q|ca ) , the probability of the query given the candidate . Below , we first detail our model , and then evaluate its effectiveness . 2.1 Modeling Expert Search didate . That is , p(q|ca ) ∝P
We first find documents ( ie , e mail messages ) which are relevant to the query topic and then score each candidate by aggregating over all documents associated with that cand p(q|d)p(ca|d ) . To determine p(q|d ) , the probability of a query given a document , we use a standard language modeling for IR approach . To estimate the strength of the association between document d and candidate ca , p(ca|d ) , we assume that an association score a(d , ca ) has been calculated for each document d and for each candidate ca . To turn these associations into probdi∈D a(di , ca) ) , where abilities , we put p(ca|d ) = a(d , ca)/(P
D is a set of e mail messages .
To compute the associations a(d , ca ) we exploit the fact that our documents are e mail messages . A list of candidate experts is created by extracting names and e mail addresses from message headers . We introduce four binary association methods for deciding whether a document d and candidate ca are associated :
A0 EMAIL FROM returns 1 if the candidate appears in the from field of the e mail
A1 EMAIL TO returns 1 if the candidate appears in the to field of the e mail
A2 EMAIL CC returns 1 if the candidate appears in the cc field of the e mail
A3 EMAIL CONTENT returns 1 if the candidate ’s name appears in the content of the e mail message . The first and last names are obligatory ; middle names are not .
Since A0–A3 are likely to capture different aspects of the relation between a document and a candidate expert , we also put a(d , ca ) :=P3 consider ( linear ) combinations of their outcomes . Hence , we i=0 πiAi(d , ca ) , where the πi are weights .
2.2 Experimental Evaluation
We carried out experiments to answer the following question : how effective is our modeling approach for finding experts ? The document collection we use is part of the W3C corpus [ 4 ] , which was used at the 2005 TREC Enterprise track [ 3 ] and comes with a list of candidate experts , expert finding topics , and relevance assessments for these topics . For the purposes of our experiments , we restrict ourselves to the e mail lists in the corpus , omitting other types of documents from the W3C corpus and candidate expert names that do not occur in the e mail lists .
We conducted two sets of experiments : comparing the impact of the association methods on expert finding effectiveness , and examining the impact of combinations of these association methods . Table 1 contains the expert finding results for different association methods . The most effective association method is A0 ( EMAIL FROM ) , on all measures .

Assuming that different associations perform in complementary ways , we explored linear combinations of association methods ; Table 2 reports a sample of results . Briefly , the main findings are ( i ) using the EMAIL CONTENT method improves on the number of retrieved candidates , but hurts on other measures ; ( ii ) extra weights on a single header field improves , but only on a subset of the measures ; ( iii ) our best found combination ( bottom row ) improves on all measures . Surprisingly , the cc field has a great importance when it is used within a combination ; the person being cc’d appears to be an authority on the content of the message . map combination %rel 0.233 62.2 single bests 0.183 1+1+1+1 62.7 65.0 0.242 2+1+1+0 0.236 65.6 1+2+1+0 0.238 65.0 1+1+2+0 15+1+25+0 65.2 0.239 0.279

3 . MINING CONTACT DETAILS
Once an expert has been determined , retrieving his/her contact details is a natural next component of an operational expert finder . We show that contact details can be effectively mined from e mail signatures .
3.1 Extracting Signatures
One of the challenges of expert profiling is to maintain a database with the candidates’ details . To address the issue , we mine the e mail signatures . Many ( but by no means all ) contain reliable details about a person ’s affiliation and contact details .
Before mining signatures , we need to identify them . Our heuristics are precision oriented ; using the following heuristics we find a large number of signatures with valuable personal data : ( i ) signatures are placed at the end of the e mails and separated from the message body with " " ; ( ii ) the length of a signature should be between 3 and 10 lines ; ( iii ) it should contain at least one web address or tel/fax number ; and ( iv ) signatures containing stop words ( PS , antivirus , disclaimer , etc . ) or PGP keys are ignored . 3.2 Statistics on Experts’ Details
How effective are our unsupervised methods for extracting personal information ? Table 3 details the results of our signature mining experiments . ALL refers to all people found within the corpus , while W3C refers to people found that were on the list of candidate experts , provided by TREC . We restricted our identification method to find people that appear more than 5 times in e mail headers . signatures extracted unique signatures people identified personal data found in signatures

4 . CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK We have presented methods for expertise identification using e mail communications . Our expert modeling approach uses language modeling techniques and combines evidences of expertise . This method is very effective in terms of the number of relevant experts found . Possible further improvements concern determining more expertise indicators and using the thread structure of the e mail lists . Our extraction method finds contact information for candidates using email signatures . In future work we plan to extract additional details , such as affiliation and address information .
