INTRODUCTION
Since the inception of the World Wide Web , URI/URLs [ 1 ] have been the most common way of locating HTTP resources . Today , people exchange information on the location of web based resources using URLs . These URLs could include a fragment identifier [ 2 ] ( if any ) so that the desired information can be accessed quickly . Till today , the fragment identifier ’s interpretation has been to denote predefined sections of a web page by its author . We propose to use the information in the fragment identifier for arbitrary content location , presentation and processing through enhanced HTTP clients . We refer to URLs , which use the fragment identifier for these content centric purposes , as ’Live URLs’ .
2 . BENEFITS
A ’Live URL’ enabled client has the capability to address content on any HTML page arbitrarily . The creation and usage of ’Live URLs’ is independent of the page creator and the underlying HTML source . ’Live URLs’ can be used in the same manner as existing URLs . Addressing and client side processing of web content is not restricted by a central server or entity . Web annotation projects like W3C ’s Annotea [ 3 ] can take advantage of addressing and processing capabilities of ’Live URLs’ .

3 . LIVE URLS
The purpose of the fragment identifier as per the W3C URL addressing standards is to represent a fragment or a sub function within an object [ 2 ] [ 1 ] . The interpretation of the fragment identifier is dependent on the media type of the retrieval result . The current interpretation of the fragment identifier for HTML pages is to locate pre defined anchor references in the HTML source . Though the URL addressing semantics mention that specific syntaxes like line and character range , or coordinates can be used as the fragment identifier , we feel it has been grossly under utilized . The following example illustrates how the fragment identifier can be effectively used . 3.1 Example
A typical URL with a fragment identifier would be : http://wwwexamplecom/urlhtml#urgent In this case the browser focuses on the section which is anchored by name urgent .
A ’Live URL’ would look like : http://wwwexamplecom/urlhtml#top=13,left=46 , right=89,bottom=02,action=highlight where the co ordinates specify which section is to be prominently displayed . This scheme also gives the flexibility of how we want to process and display the specified content .
We refer to the new URLs as ’Live URLs’ as they bring dynamism to otherwise static content . 3.2 Applications
Some of the applications of ’Live URLs’ are discussed be low .
321 Locating content
’Live URLs’ can be used to specify information about the location of content within a web page . The location identifier could be one of the following :
DOM elements and offsets within them Using unique DOM ( Document Object Model ) elements and offsets to identify the starting and ending points of selected content , information about the selected content could be specified in the ’Live URL’ . The Ahoy project [ 4 ] has an implementation which generates unique DOM identifiers for arbitrary points of a HTML document .
Search strings The ’Live URL’ could also contain ” search strings ” which could be used to locate sections of a web page .
XPointer ’Live URLs’ could also contain XPointers ( XML Pointer Language ) [ 5 ] , which are used to locate content in XML documents .
Byte offsets The HTTP protocol [ 6 ] specifies that a byte range can be used to denote a subset of a larger HTTP entity . Byte range specifications in HTTP refer to a sequence of bytes in the entity body . The byte range which is required for display of content can be passed as part of the ’Live URL’ .
Using web page co ordinates This method is based on the fact that the whole web page is mapped onto a co ordinate based grid . The starting and ending coordinates of a selected portion of a web page are specified in the ’Live URL’ as name value pairs .
322 Dynamic content processing
In addition to locating content , ’Live URLs’ can also specify a host of content specific actions like highlighting , searching , zooming , removal etc .
323 Client side scripting
’Live URLs’ can also be used as a generic mechanism of providing input parameters to client side scripts . Client side scripting technologies like AHAH [ 7 ] can benefit from ’Live URLs’ as the remote HTML/XHTML fragments , can be addressed using ’Live URLs’ . 3.3 HTTP Clients
The capability to handle ’Live URLs’ will be built into HTTP clients ( primarily web browsers ) . As per current implementations , clients retrieve the document specified by the given URL and render it . If there is a fragment identifier specified in the URL , the focus is shifted to that section . In this case , the client is enhanced to interpret the fragment information that is part of the ’Live URL’ and suitably render the referenced content . Also , existing clients will not reject ’Live URLs’ totally , but show the entire web page without any modifications . This stems from the fact that , non existent fragment identifiers are discarded by clients .
We are currently working on a reference implementation as an extension [ 8 ] to the Mozilla Firefox web browser [ 9 ] .
4 . USE CASES
Possible use cases of the proposed ’Live URL’ concept are discussed below . 4.1 Client use case
A user while reading a web page , comes across a section of the page which he wants to share . He selects the section and obtains a ’Live URL’ for the selected portion from a browser menu option . He then passes on this ’Live URL’ to a receiver . The receiver opens the ’Live URL’ using his ’Live URL’ aware browser . The ’Live URL’ aware browser retrieves the document and uses the information in the ’Live URL’ to display the content that was selected by the sender in a prominent manner . 4.2 Server/Web application use case
A typical example of a server/web application use case would be a search engine which returns ’Live URLs’ as part of search results . The user can open the ’Live URLs’ to view the relevant content directly .
Another use case would be a situation , where the server would want to offload some of the processing to the client . For example , when the server wants to highlight certain content on a web page , instead of generating the highlighted content on the server , it could redirect the client to a ’Live URL’ , which has necessary inputs for the client to perform the highlighting .
5 . FUTURE WORK
Future work on ’Live URLs’ could include development of client side scripting frameworks which could take advantage of parameters passed as part of ’Live URLs’ . It could also include enhancing HTTP servers to support generation of ’Live URLs’ based on client ’s capabilities .

7 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we have proposed a novel approach of using URI fragment identifiers to enable HTTP clients to address and process content , independent of its original representation . We foresee a variety of applications of the concept proposed , ranging from simple content sharing to accurate and focussed search results . The proposed concept can be extended used to selectively access audio/video content . We believe fragment identifiers can be used to make HTTP clients smarter and ’Live URLs’ are a step in that direction .
