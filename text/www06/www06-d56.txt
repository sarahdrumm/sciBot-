ABSTRACT We show that the empirical distribution of the PageRank values in a large set of Web pages does not follow a powerlaw except for some particular choices of the damping factor . We argue that for a graph with an in degree distribution following a power law with exponent between 2.1 and 2.2 , choosing a damping factor around 0.85 for PageRank yields a power law distribution of its values . We suggest that power law distributions of PageRank in Web graphs have been observed because the typical damping factor used in practice is between 0.85 and 090
1 . DISTRIBUTION OF PAGERANK VALUES PageRank [ 5 ] is a link based ranking function with a recursive definition : a page with a high PageRank is cited by many pages with high PageRank . More precisely , let An.n be the link matrix of a Web graph of n pages , such that ai;j = 1 iff there is a hyperlink between pages i and j in the Web graph . Let P be the row normalized version of this ma trix , such that Pj=1::n pi;j = 1 8i . The PageRank vector r(ff ) is defined as the stationary distribution of the matrix ffP +
1 , ff n
1n.n :
We calculated the PageRank over a graph with 1 million nodes and 22 million edges ; this graph was obtained from a crawl restricted to the .GR domain [ 1 ] , and corresponds only to the main strongly connected component of that graph . The reason why we are using only the strongly connected component is that we want to compute the PageRank distribution also for high values of ff , up to 099
In Figure 1 we show the PageRank distribution for varying values of the damping factor , using a complementary cumulative distribution function ( 1 CDF ) plot . The tail , starting around the top 5% 10 % of the nodes , always follows a power law with the same exponent no matter which damping factor we choose . The distribution for the remaining 90% 95 % of the data varies with the damping factor .
We tried fitting a power law distribution to the distribution of PageRank using the Hill estimator [ 2 ] ; in this data set with ff 0:7 , 0:8 there seems to be a power law distribution over the entire range , but in other cases the power law only fits the tail .

Next we consider a Double Pareto distribution[4 ] . The Double Pareto distribution looks like a bi lineal in a loglog plot , and can be seen as similar to a log normal . If we assume this model , we can fit a power law separately to the body and the tail of the distribution , as shown in Figure 2 . We confirmed that there is a varying slope in the body of the distribution and a fixed slope in the tail . The tail corresponds to highly ranked pages and begins roughly at the intersection point in Figure 1 , which corresponds to PageRank= 1=n . t n e n o p x E w a − r e w o P l

‹ The tail of the distribution appears to follow a constant exponent , no matter which damping factor is used , while for most of the pages the distribution depends on the damping factor . For some particular values of the damping factor , both exponents are close to each other and the distribution looks like a power law over the entire range . The exponent in the tail is about 2:2 , which is the same exponent as the power law for the in degree in this dataset . This coincidence between the distribution of in degree and the tail of PageRank was also observed in [ 6 ] .
2 . A DAMPING FACTOR TO GET A SIN
GLE POWER LAW
In this section we assume the Double pareto model with intersection around 1=n and show that this hypothesis provides a reasonable explanation to the observation of a powerlaw distribution for the PageRank in many cases . Observe first that at every iteration of the computation , every page is given a baseline probability xmin given by xmin =
1 , ff n
:
If for all points greater than xmin a distribution follows a power law with exponent , its probability density function p(x ) and cumulative distribution function F ( x ) are [ 4 ] p(x ) =
, 1 min , 1 x,+1 x ,
F ( x ) = x,+1 , x,+1 min 1 , x,+1 min where we have imposed the constraint that this particular distribution has a maximum possible value of 1 . Following figure 1 , we now compute 1 , F ( 1=n ) . Straightforward computations show that , if n * 1 , as is in all cases of practical interest , 1,F ( 1=n ) ’ ( 1,ff),1 . The meaning of this result is that , if we assume that a single Pareto distribution approximates the PageRank distribution over the entire range of values , then 1 , F ( 1=n ) does not depend on n . If we adopt the hypothesis of the Double Pareto distribution , this is what should happen for the particular value of ff such that the distributions that approximate the body and the tail have the same exponent .
In our case , if we accept the hypothesis in [ 6 ] , that is , the power law exponent for the distribution of the tail of the PageRank values is the same as for the in degree of pages ( as has been observed experimentally in most Web characterization studies ) , then in our collection of 1 million nodes with = 2:2 and ff = 0:85 , the value predicted is 1 , F ( 1=n ) ’ 0:10 and the observed 0:12 . In the WebBase collection of 130 million documents [ 3 ] with = 2:07 and ff = 0:85 the predicted is 1 , F ( 1=n ) ’ 0:13 and the observed is 0:16 . The value of 1 , F ( 1=n ) in fact , does not seem to depend on n . Finally , also the *brownedu example considered in [ 6 ] shows a change of behaviour around 1=n ( slightly more than 105 in their case ) , although they provide the raw histogram and not the cumulative distribution .
Having a single power law over the entire range could be useful if we want to combine the PageRank values with other scoring functions , as in that case log(PageRank ) has a uniform distribution .
3 . LOGNORMAL PLUS BASELINE MODEL Next we consider the power law distribution as the sum of two random variables ; let X be a random variable dis tributed according to a log normal with parameters and . Let F ( x ) be the cumulative density function ( CDF ) of X . We now consider
Y = ffX +
1 , ff n as a random variable which should have a distribution similar to the one of PageRank . The CDF of this distribution is :
P ( Y y ) = F y , 1,ff ff n
:
For obtaining the and parameters , we fitted this distribution to the distribution of PageRank with ff = 0:99 using least squares method . The result is shown in Figure 3 . The obtained parameters are = ,16:90 , = 2:45 . We have observed that with the same and , our model fits PageRank also for all the other values of ff = 0:1 ; 0:2 ; . . . ; 0:9 with an average relative error of less than 1.5 % over the entire range of PageRank values .
