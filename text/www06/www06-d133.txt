ABSTRACT Readability assessment is a method to measure the difficulty of a piece of text material , and it is widely used in educational field to assist instructors to prepare appropriate materials for students . In this paper , we investigate the applications of readability assessment in Web development , such that users can retrieve information which is appropriate to their levels . We propose a bilingual ( English and Chinese ) assessment scheme for Web page and Web site readability based on textual features , and conduct a series of experiments with real Web data to evaluate our scheme . Experimental results show that , apart from just indicating the readability level , the estimated score acts as a good heuristic to figure out pages with low textual content . Furthermore , we can obtain the overall content distribution in a Web site by studying the variation of its readability .

INTRODUCTION
The World Wide Web contains vast amount of valuable information , but there is not enough guidance for users to find information that is appropriate to their reading ability levels . When a user raises a query , existing search engines mainly return semantically related materials , but whether the user has sufficient ability to understand the materials is often overlooked .
To enhance user experience , we investigate the use of readability assessment , which is a method to measure the difficulty of a piece of text material [ 5 ] , in Web information retrieval . We propose a bilingual ( English and Chinese ) Web page and site readability assessment scheme based on textual features of the pages . As English and Chinese pages cover over 70 % of the total Web pages [ 2 ] , our scheme will have a high impact on the Internet community . 2 . WEB READABILITY
Web Page Readability . For Web page readability , we adopt two existing assessments , Flesch [ 4 ] formula and Yang [ 6 ] formula , proposed in educational field originally as a

( 1 ) where XEi and XCi are the factors : XE1 : Average number of syllables per word ; XE2 : Average sentence length ; XC1 : Proportion of full sentence ; XC2 : Proportion of words in Chinese basic word list ; XC3 : Average number of stroke of characters ; XC4 : Num of chars with stroke = 5 ( in 100 chars sample ) ; XC5 : Num of chars with stroke = 12 ( in 100 chars sample ) ; XC6 : Num of chars with stroke = 22 ( in 100 chars sample ) ; XC7 : Num of chars with stroke = 23 ( in 100 chars sample ) ; The score of this formula is scaled between 0 and 100 . The smaller the score , the more difficult the text passage is .
Web Site Readability . Web site readability is an indicator of overall difficulty level of a site , and it is defined over the proposed page readability . We first describe the following terms before continuing the discussion . Web site is a group of Web pages with the same domain name in the URLs . Root page of a Web site , is a user specified page where the crawling of the site starts . Page level of a Web page within a site is the minimum number of traversal reaching it starting from the root page of the Web site through hyperlinks .
We propose three site readability assessments in terms of pages at different page levels : ( 1 ) Exact Level , ( 2 ) InLevel , and ( 3 ) Out Level ( depicted in Figure 1 ) , aiming at describing the site difficulty from different angles of pages composition .
Exact Level Readability indicates the average readability of pages at a particular level . By using this metric , Web authors can decide how the readability should change with levels . Take Online Teaching Site as an example . Teachers may want to teach some simpler things at the beginning , and then increase the difficulty level gradually . By analyzing the

Figure 2 : Experimental Results : ( a ) Page Readability Distribution ( Left ) , ( b ) Site Readability of CSE ( Middle ) , and ( c ) Site
Readability of HKGOV ( Right ) changes of Exact Level readability along levels , teachers can then prepare and arrange materials in the proper order .
In Level Readability of a site gives the average readability of Web pages starting from root page up to pages at specified level . This is an overall indicator of a site difficulty . By using this metric , users can get a general idea of whether the site is suitable to them before start browsing it .
Out Level Readability of a site gives the average readability of Web pages starting one level upper than the specified one , up to pages with maximum available level , which is determined by the depth of crawling . In another words , it is a difficulty indicator of remaining pages after browsing a site for some times . Users may make use of this metric as one of factors in deciding whether he or she should continue browsing the site . 3 . EXPERIMENTS AND DISCUSSION
We carry out two experiments to evaluate our proposed Web readability assessment on the following sites : ( 1 ) Department of CSE , CUHK ( CSE ) [ 1 ] , and ( 2 ) The Hong Kong Government ( HKGOV ) [ 3 ] . All experiments are run on a Pentium 4 3.4GHz , 4GB memory machine with Red Hat Fedora Core 4 as operating system .
Experiment 1 : Web Page Readability . Figure 2(a ) shows the Web page readability distribution of the two Web sites being tested . The first observation is that both CSE and HKGOV have large portion of pages with scores ranged from 0 to 5 . To investigate this phenomenon , we manually examine those pages and find that they mainly belongs index pages , which are introductory pages having hyperlinks to internal pages . Index pages generally receive low readability score than passage pages . It is because only index terms will remain after extracting raw texts from those pages , and a long sentence will form because there are no separators such as full stop to delimit the index terms . As a result , a long sentence will reduce the readability scores of index pages , although they should not be that difficult apparently .
The second observation is that CSE has larger portion of high scored ( less difficult ) pages than HKGOV . It is because CSE contains personal pages of staffs and students , in which the contents are easier to be comprehended than formal articles published in HKGOV .
Conclusion : In addition to measuring difficulty of pages , page readability can also be a good indicator for figuring out low textual content pages such as index pages .
Experiment 2 : Web Site Readability . Figure 2(b ) and ( c ) show the site readability against levels of the two Web sites . The two graphs exhibit two types of readability variation : CSE has a dramatic change on readability , while HKGOV has a gradual change on it .
For CSE , we find that Exact Level score gradually increases from level 2 to 5 , and has a drop in level 6 . It is because the pages located in level 4 and 5 are personal pages . Following our explanation in last section that they are easier to be comprehended , the site readability increases . For level 6 , we find that as this level is right after personal pages , authors would like to put more non textual information such as images , videos etc . , causing the drop in score . In Level score generally follows the trend of Exact Level , but with a smoother variation due to accumulation effect of scores starting from level 0 . For Out Level score , although level 6 has relatively low Exact Level and In Level scores , it has high Out Level score , which indicates the contents at later levels will be relatively easier . This may motivate users to continue browsing the site .
For HKGOV , it has a gradual change in Exact Level score , indicating that pages at different levels have similar difficulty . It is because as a government organization , its Web site is well organized to give pages with similar difficulties . Due to the gradual change of Exact Level score , In Level and Out Level scores behave nearly the same .
Conclusion : By analyzing the Web site readability variation graph , we can get the content structure and distribution of a site . Web authors can then make use of this information to make the site organization better . 4 . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper , we propose a bilingual readability assessment scheme for Web page and site in English and Chinese languages . Experimental results show that , for page readability , apart from just indicating difficulty , it can also serve as a good indicator of low textual content pages such as index and multimedia pages . For site readability , we can get an overall picture of content structure by studying the score variation . The future work includes establishing better Web readability formulas and performing experiments in larger scale . We also plan to apply the proposed scheme in other Web related applications . 5 .
