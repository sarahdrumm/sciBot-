ABSTRACT Search engine results are usually presented in some form of text summary ( eg , document title , some snippets of the page ’s content , a URL , etc ) . Based on the information contained within these summaries users make relevance judgments about what links best suit their information needs . Current research suggests that these relevance judgments are in the service of some search strategy . In this paper , we model two different search strategies ( the comparison and threshold strategies ) and determine how well they fit data gathered from an experiment on user search within a simulated Google environment .

INTRODUCTION There are a number of models of the cognitive processes underlying Internet navigation . Generally , these models assume that users are sensitive to some form of estimate of the likelihood that a link item will lead to some target information . However , the models differ in , for example , which link items are considered , and in the selection strategy that makes use of these estimates . link analysis ,
Miller [ 5 ] has classified models into those that assess links from either a ‘threshold’ or a ‘comparison’ approach . From the threshold perspective , a link is selected if it is above an established threshold . Otherwise , users proceed to the next link for assessment ( eg [ 5] ) . From the comparison perspective , a user may first assess several links and then select the link with the

In this paper , we consider whether these strategies of user search are predictively useful when applied to first click behavior . Firstclick behavior refers to what happens when a user ( i ) poses a query to a search engine to fulfil some information need , ( ii ) evaluates the result list returned to that query and ( iii ) then chooses one of these results as a link to follow . We focus on firstclick behavior as this presents us with a clean scenario for examining these factors in a search environment ( eg , repeated query refinement in a progressive search would be a lot more complex ) . 2 . METHOD Thirty participants were asked to answer 16 Computer Science questions ( eg “ Who invented Java ? ” ) by running as many queries as they liked on a simulated Google environment . The result set returned for a particular query came in one of two forms : ( a ) a normal presentation of Google ’s first page ( top 10 ) results ( b ) a reversed presentation of Google ’s first page ( top 10 ) results ( see [ 3 ] for more details ) . From a modeling perspective the comparison approach obviously predicts no change in the results selected across both conditions – these models predict that users should hunt down the list to highly relevant results irrespective of their position in the list . Conversely , the threshold approach predicts the selection of quite different results across both conditions depend on what threshold is chosen . Bloodhound scent scores [ 2 ] were calculated as a means of modeling result relevance estimates . The search results were also manually ranked by a group of 14 raters to test the aptness of these scores . 3 . RESULTS The average user ranking for queries was found to correlate highly with the average search engine rank ( r2=0.9124 t=9.13 ; df=8 ; p<.0001 ) , demonstrating the search engine ’s relevance metrics closely parallel people ’s subjective estimates of relevance . The average user evaluation rank was also found to correlate highly with the average bloodhound score ( r2=0.6665 ; t= 4 ; df=8 ; p<.001 ; figure 3 ) . Obviously , then this automated method can be considered a viable means for modeling some aspects of people ’s assessments of the relevance of items . As Keane , O’Brien & Smyth [ 3 ] have shown behavior in the normal and reversed conditions of the experiment are not identical . Items with the highest relevance ranks ( ie , items from the top of the normal Google result list ) are chosen 70 % of the time in the normal condition , but this rate drops to 10 % in the reversed condition . In contrast , the 9th and 10th relevance ranked that items are chosen more often ( 13 % and 41 % , respectively ) in the reversed condition than in the normal one ( 2 % and 2 % , respectively ) . Intermediately ranked items are much the same across both conditions . s k c i l

As the results across the two conditions were quite different the comparison approach to modeling the results fares less well than the threshold approach The comparison approach correctly predicts 25 % of results in the normal condition , and 9 % in the reversed condition . The threshold approach , on the other hand , proved reasonably successful ( see Figure 2 ) . Using a very simplified approach to threshold modeling whereby at each decision point ( search engine result ) the model was faced with a binary decision that result ( Bloodhound score>0.1 ) or proceed to the next ( Bloodhound score<0.1 ) the model correctly predicted over 61 % of results in the normal condition . This is quite impressive considering the model ’s simplicity and that the base line chance level is 10 % ( 1 in 10 ) . Recently Klockner et al . [ 4 ] analyzed eye movements over a Google webpage . They found that 65 % of users applied a strategy in which they examined the search results list in turn , deciding immediately whether to click or not . Fifteen percent adopted a strategy in which they looked at all of the results in the list , and then clicked on the most promising results . The remaining 20 % showed a mixed strategy and only sometimes looked ahead at the next few results . The threshold model obviously only models those that tend to examine and click on results sequentially .
This threshold model does not prove quite as successful at modeling the reversed condition ( 34% ) , though it still proved significantly better than its comparison counterpart ( 9% ) . The “ reversed ” condition ’s re ordering of the results effectively changes the perceived quality of the highly ranked results . From the results it is clear that users react to this degraded ranking and visit lower ranked links more frequently . It may be the case that users adapt their search strategies to different search situations and that when a list contains many low relevant items they tend to perform a more exhaustive search than when a list contains many high relevant items [ 1 ] . Thus , whilst this simplified threshold model does provide a reasonable approximation to human behavior , it does not do a good job at taking into account strategy changes that emerge from different relevance topologies in a result list . Characterizing and modeling the dynamics of internet search has significant scientific and commercial value , and the ability to accurately predict user surfing patterns could lead to a number of improvements in web search . A comprehensive model of usersearch engine interaction , for example , could enable both users and designers to understand and address recent concerns surrounding the search engines power to route traffic . The work presented in this paper needs to form part of a larger effort to achieve this research goal . 4 .
