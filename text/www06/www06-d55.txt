ABSTRACT Compared with the structured world ( eg Relational Databases ) , mining from XML data is confronted with more challenges due to the inherent flexibilities of XML in both structure and semantics . The major challenges include 1 ) a more complicated hierarchical data structure ; 2 ) an ordered data context ; and 3 ) a much bigger size for each data element . In order to make XML enabled association rule mining truly practical and computationally tractable , we propose a practical model for mining association rules from XML documents and demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of model through a set of experiments on real life data .

INTRODUCTION Data mining is usually used to extract interesting knowledge from large amounts of data stored in databases or data warehouses . This knowledge can be represented in many different ways such as clusters , decision trees , decision rules , etc . Among them , association rules have been proved effective in discovering interesting relations in massive amounts of data . Currently , XML is penetrating virtually all areas of Internet application programming and is bringing about huge amount of data encoded in XML . With the continuous growth in XML data sources , the ability to extract knowledge from them for decision support becomes increasingly important and desirable [ 3 ] . Due to the inherent flexibilities of XML , in both structure and semantics , mining knowledge in the XML Era is faced with more challenges than in the traditional structured world . In this paper , we propose a practical model for mining association rules from XML documents . Our model is based on XML enabled association rule framework that was introduced by Feng [ 2 ] . XML AR framework extends the notion of associated items to XML fragments to present associations among trees rather than simple structured items of atomic values .

Although this framework is flexible and powerful enough to represent simple and complex structured association rules in XML documents [ 4 ] but to our best knowledge no implementation model has been proposed yet .
2 . XML Association Rules Association rules were first introduced by Agrawal et al . to analyze customer habits in retail databases . Association rule is an implication of the form X ⇒ Y , where the rule body X and head Y are subsets of the set I of items ( I ={I1 , I2 , . . . , In} ) within a set of transactions D and X ∩ Y = φ . A rule X ⇒ Y states that the transactions T that contain the items in X are likely to contain also the items in Y . Association rules are characterized by two measures : the support , which measures the percentage of transactions in D that contain both items X and Y ; the confidence , which measures the percentage of transactions in D containing the items X that also contain the items Y [ Figure 1 ] . In XML context , both D and I are collections of trees [ 1 ] , in the same way X and Y are XML fragments [ Figure 2 ] .

3 . XML Association Rule Mining ( Practical Model ) We consider the problem of mining XML association rules from content [ 3 ] of XML documents based on user provided rule template . We suggest an implementation model for the XML AR framework that was introduced by Feng [ 2 ] . Our practical model consists of 5 steps ( see Figure 6 ) : Filtering , Generating Virtual Transactions , Finding Association Rules , Converting extracted rules to XML AR rules and Visualizing . Filtering and Generating virtual transactions are most important steps in this model so we describe these two steps in more details . Filtering step uses the XML AR template and extracts only those parts of XML that are interesting for the user . In the next step , we define a transaction context , based on tag nesting in XML document and use it to generate virtual transactions that can be used as input format by association rule mining algorithms ( eg Apriori ) . As an example , consider the problem of mining frequent associations among people who appear as coauthors , with our
XML AR template we formulate this task by the following statement :
<dblp><*><author> ? </author></*></dblp>(cid:206 ) <dblp><*><author> ? </author></*></dblp>
Figure 3 . XML AR template for finding coauthors
Above statement has two parts ( body and head ) and each part has 3 level XML fragment and we are going to find patterns in 3rd level or author tag , so <author> ? </author> is equal to items i∈I , in addition <author> ? </author> occur in <*></*> so <*></*> is our transactions t∈T and <dblp></dblp> is equal to database D . [ Table 1 ] displays generated virtual transactions based on XML AR template in [ Figure 3 ] and following XML fragment of DBLP collection :

TID 1 2 4 . Experimental Results Two sets of experiments are performed on DBLP1 collection . We implement prototype of our model by VS .Net 2005 ( C# ) . 4.1 Experiment 1 – Finding Coauthors In this experiment we extract the Co Authoring relationship between different authors in DBLP data set . DBLP collection has 328858 bibliography of different publications ( article , book , PhD thesis , etc ) expressed in XML format . We use rule template introduced in [ Figure 3 ] and input parameters in [ Table 2 ] , [ Figure 5 ] and [ Table 3 ] display some of results :

5 . Conclusions Main contribution of this paper is extending and implementing the XML AR framework that was introduced by Feng [ 2 ] . In addition we suggested a practical model that can be used for mining association rules from XML documents . Our model uses XMLAR template for filtering data and generating virtual transactions so it can efficiently find the rules in which the user is mostly interested . Applying frequent sub tree mining techniques and directly mining frequent XML fragments is our future work . 6 . References [ 1 ] Braga D . , A . Campi , M . Klemettinen , and P . L . Lanzi .
