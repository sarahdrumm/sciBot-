ABSTRACT We consider template independent news extraction . The state of the art news extraction method is based on template level wrapper induction , which has two serious limitations . 1 ) It cannot correctly extract pages belonging to an unseen template until the wrapper for that template has been generated . 2 ) It is costly to maintain up to date wrappers for hundreds of websites , because any change of a template may lead to the invalidation of the corresponding wrapper . In this paper we formalize news extraction as a machine learning problem and learn a template independent wrapper using a very small number of labeled news pages from a single site . Novel features dedicated to news titles and bodies are developed respectively . Correlations between the news title and the news body are exploited . Our template independent wrapper can extract news pages from different sites regardless of templates . In experiments , a wrapper is learned from 40 pages from a single news site . It achieved 98.1 % accuracy over 3,973 news pages from 12 news sites .

INTRODUCTION As most news pages today are generated from some underlying structured sources , it is intuitive to assume the existence of templates in news pages from a specific news portal . Some previous template dependent approaches like Tree Edit Distance ( TED ) exploit structure similarities of Web pages [ 1 ] . However , the generated wrappers only work properly for news pages belonging to previously seen templates . Any subtle changes in the underlying templates are likely to invalidate the wrappers . To eliminate the template dependency of wrappers , Zheng et al . proposed a news extraction technique by exploiting the visual features of news pages [ 2 ] . The news title and body in a news page are identified as many visual blocks and extracted accordingly . However , it may fail to maintain the integrity of an extracted news article as it does not treat a news article as an inseparable unit . This approach is likely to leave out the news title or fragments of the news body . Copyright is held by the author/owner(s ) . WWW 2009 , April 20 24 , 2009 , Madrid , Spain .

However , human beings can always accurately identify the news article from a news page . This is because the news pages are usually designed to adapt to people ’s reading habits . Moreover , the fact that human can easily differentiate news title from news body [ 2 ] suggests that news titles and news bodies come with different features . Note that , there is also correlation between the news title and news body in a news page . For example , the news title and news body are usually very close in terms of vertical distance , and usually overlap largely in horizontal direction . If these features of news pages can be fully exploited , it is possible to learn a template independent wrapper using only news pages from a single news portal such that it can accurately extract news articles from various news portals . We develop a template independent wrapper that is able to accurately extract news articles from various news portals on the Web . Once the wrapper is learned using only a very small number of pages from a single news site , we are able to extract news articles from news pages in various sites . 2 . News Article Extraction 2.1 Problem Statement Let P denote a news page , TDOM denote the DOM tree built from P and T denote a subtree of TDOM . Definition 1 . T is TTITLE iff the news title is contained in T and not contained in any child subtree of T . Definition 2 . T is the TBODY iff the whole news body is contained in T and not contained in any child subtree of T . Then the news extraction problem is defined as follows : given any P , identify TTITLE and TBODY from TDOM , respectively . Using novel features defined in following sections , we built TTITLE and TBODY identification model based on nonlinear SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel respectively . 2.2 Feature Representation of Body Subtree Texts in news pages are usually carefully arranged in a comfortable format for reading via using formatting elements , which are the kind of HTML elements mainly used for texts formatting , including paragraph ( <p> ) , bold font ( <b> ) , new line ( <br> ) , italic font ( <i> ) and highlight ( <strong> ) . Let R denote the root element of T , and FE denote the collection of formatting elements which are present in the child elements of R . Let FEA denote all formatting elements inside the first two screens . The bounding rectangle of T denoted by Rect can be obtained . Features of T include the following six :
{ RectLeft , RectTop , RectWidth , RectHeight ,
FormattingElementsNum , FormatedContentLen}
WWW 2009 MADRID!Poster Sessions : Wednesday , April 22 , 20091085 1 ) RectLeft and RectTop are the coordinates of upper left point of Rect . RectWidth , RectHeight are the width and height of Rect . 2 ) FormattingElementsNum denotes the size of FE . This feature is normalized by total FormattingElementNum of FEA . 3 ) FormatedContentLen is the total length of texts contained in FE . It is normalized by total FormatedContentLen of FEA . 2.3 Feature Representation of Title Subtree Here features of T include the following ten : { RectLeft , RectTop , RectWidth , RectHeight,Overlap , Dist , Flat ,
FontSize , EndWithFullStop , WordNum }
1 ) Overlap describes the horizontal overlap between T and TBODY . News title and body are usually close in horizontal direction . 2 ) Dist describes the vertical distance between T and TBODY . The news title is not likely to be far away from the news body in terms of vertical distance . 3 ) Flat describes the shape of T . Let min be the shorter edge of the bounding rectangle of T , and max be the longer one . Flat is defined to be the ratio min/max . This is based on the observation that news titles are always bounded by long narrow rectangles . 4 ) FontSize is the font size of the root element of T . It is based on the observation that news titles are always displayed in font sizes larger enough to be distinguished from news bodies . 5 ) EndWithFullStop describes whether the text contained in T ends up with a full stop . By convention , a title hardly ends up with a full stop . This helps distinguish news titles from sentences . 6 ) WordNum describes the number of words in the text contained in T . This feature exploits the fact that news titles would not contain paragraphs of texts . 3 . Experiments We use a dataset of 4,073 news pages crawled from 12 online news sites . 1 ) In first experiment , we label 40 pages in each news site , among which 10 , 20 , 40 training examples are randomly chosen to train 3 wrappers ( W10 , W20 , W40 ) respectively . And in each site , we randomly choose 40 pages for testing . The 480 ( 40 pages×12 sites ) testing pages are different from training pages . Then each of the 36 learned wrappers is applied to extract news articles from the 480 testing pages . Finally , 17,280 ( 36 wrappers×480 testing pages ) extracted news articles are evaluated by user study . Table 1 shows the testing results . We can see that all these 36 wrappers trained from a small number of pages achieved accuracy higher than 96 % , which demonstrates the stability of our approach . Also , our approach only requires a very small number of training examples to achieve this performance . All the three wrappers trained from USNEWS achieved the highest accuracy , which implies that USNEWS is a good training site . 2 ) In second experiment , we aim to explore the performance of our template independent wrapper over thousands of pages . The USNEWS W40 wrapper trained in first experiment is used in this experiment . 40 pages from USNEWS are randomly chosen out for training the USNEWS W40 wrapper and all the remaining 3,973 pages are used for testing . The 3,973 extracted news articles are evaluated by user study . Table 2 shows the testing results . The wrapper achieved 98.1 % accuracy . This demonstrates that our proposed approach can deal with a large variety of news pages . The state of the art method proposed by Reis [ 1 ] is based on template level wrapper induction . It is unable to extract the news articles from any Web news site . Moreover , our approach achieved significantly higher accuracy than Reis’ published 87.71 % accuracy [ 1 ] .
