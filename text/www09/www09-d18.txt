ABSTRACT
There has recently been an upsurge of interest in the possibilities of combining structured data and ad hoc information retrieval from traditional hypertext . In this experiment , we run queries extracted from a query log of a major search engine against the Semantic Web to discover if the Semantic Web has anything of interest to the average user . We show that there is indeed much information on the Semantic Web that could be relevant for many queries for people , places and even abstract concepts , although they are overwhelmingly clustered around a Semantic Web enabled export of Wikipedia known as DBPedia .

1 . SAMPLING THE SEMANTIC WEB VIA
QUERY LOGS
The main problem confronting of any study of the Semantic Web is one of sampling . As almost any large data database can easily be exported to RDF , statistics demonstrating the actual deployment of the Semantic Web can be biased by the automated release of large , if useless , data sets , the equivalent of ‘Semantic Web’ spam . Also , large specialized databases like Bio2RDF can easily dwarf the rest of the Semantic Web in size . A more appropriate strategy would be to try to answer the question : What information is available on the Semantic Web that users are actually interested in ? The first largescale analysis of the Semantic Web was done via an inspection of the index of Swoogle by Ding and Finin [ 4 ] . The primary limitation of that study was that the study was done before the release of Linked Data resources like the DBPedia , and therefore missing much Semantic Web data users might find interesting [ 1 ] .
The obvious candidate for sampling what users are interested in would be look at a search engine query log . Since Semantic Web search engines are currently under development and used mostly by Semantic Web developers instead of ordinary users , the query log of a popular hypertext search engine should be used as opposed

We use a search query log of approximately 15 million distinct queries from Microsoft Live Search . This query log contains 14,921,285 queries . Of these queries , 7,095,302 ( 47.55 % ) were unique , and corrected for capitalization , 6,623,635 ( 44.39 % ) were unique .
2 . ENTITIES AND CONCEPTS
The main issue confronting using a query log for discovering information on the Semantic Web is the presence of navigational and other non informational queries . A straightforward gazetteer based named entity recognizer was employed to discover the names of people and places , which are called entity queries . The gazetteer for person names was based off a list of names maintained by the Social Security Administration and the gazetteer for place names was based on the gazetteer provided by the Alexandria Digital Library Project . A total of 509,659 queries ( 7.694 % ) were identified as either people or places by the named entity recognizer . We employed WordNet to approximate discovering ‘abstract’ concepts in the query log . Queries of length one where the query had both a hyponym and hypernym were selected , resulting in 16,698 queries ( .003% ) , which we call the concept queries . Both types of queries are plotted in logarithmic space and both appear unsurprisingly to be power law distributions in Figure 1 . The α of entity queries was calculated to be 2.31 , with long tail behavior starting around a popularity of 17 and a Kolmogorov Smirnov D statistic of .0241 [ 3 ] . The α of the queries for concepts was calculated to be 2.12 , with long tail behavior starting around a popularity of 36 with a Kolmogorov Smirnov D statistic of 0170 y r e u Q l y t i r a u p o P

MANTIC WEB
The results of running the queries for entities and concepts against a Semantic Web search engine , FALCON S ’s Object Search [ 2 ] , were surprisingly fruitful . For entity queries , there was an average of 1,339 URIs ( SD 8,000 ) returned for each query . On the other hand , for concept queries , there were an average of 26,294 URIs ( SD 14,1580 ) returned per query . Obviously , a non normal distribution is at hand . As shown in Figure 2 , when plotted in logarithmic space , both entity queries and concept queries show a distribution that is heavily skewed towards a very large number of high frequency results , with a steep drop off to almost zero results instead of the characteristic long tail of a power law . For the vast majority of queries , far from having no information about content of the queries , the Semantic Web appears to have too much data .

Figure 2 : The rank ordered frequency distribution of the number of URIs returned from entity and concept queries , with the entity queries given by green and the concept queries by blue .
Another question is whether or not there is any correlation between the amount of URIs returned from the Semantic Web and the popularity of the query . As shown by Figure 3 , there is no correlation between the amount of URIs returned from the Semantic Web and the popularity of the query . For entity queries , the correlation coefficient was .0077 , while for concept queries , the correlation coefficient was still insignificant , at 0125 The popularity of a query is not related to how much information the Semantic Web possesses on the information need expressed by the query : Popular queries may have little data , while infrequent queries may have a lot . This is likely due to the rapidly changing and event dependent nature of hypertext Web queries versus the Semantic Web ’s preference for more permanent and less temporally dependent data .
4 . SEMANTIC WEB STATISTICS
Where is this Semantic data coming from ? In order to answer this question , we restricted our analysis to the top 10 Semantic Web URI results for each query , and to distinguish this subset from all the URIs returned by the Semantic Web , we call these the top URIs . These top URIs totaled 70,128 , which were composed of 25,400 ( 36.21 % ) concept queries and 44,728 ( 63.78 % ) entity queries . The top 10 domain names of the crawled URIs is given by Table 4 . DBPedia , the export of Wikipedia to RDF , dominates the results with 83.11 % of all URIs coming from DBPedia and Wikipedia [ 1 ] . The W3C is the third largest exporter of RDF with a share of 492 % Upon closer inspection , this is mostly due to the hosting of the lexical base Wordnet in RDF . The blog site Liveinternet.ru appears to export FOAF for its users .
5 . CONCLUSION
In conclusion , there is a large amount of information that may be of interest to ordinary hypertext users on the Semantic Web , although there is no correlation between the popularity of queries and the availability of that information on the Semantic Web . However , the vast majority of this information is easily accessed natively in hypertext in Wikipedia or in RDF via DBPedia .
