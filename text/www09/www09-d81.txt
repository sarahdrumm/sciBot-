ABSTRACT This paper proposes an effective approach to provide relevant search terms for conceptual Web search . ‘Semantic Term Suggestion’ function has been included so that users can find the most appropriate query they really need . Conventional approaches for term suggestion involve extracting frequently occurring key terms from retrieved documents . They must deal with term extraction difficulties and interference from irrelevant documents . In this paper , we propose a semantic term suggestion function called Collective Intelligence based Term Suggestion ( CITS ) . CITS provides a novel social network based framework for relevant terms suggestion with a semantic graph of the search term without limiting to the specific query term . A visualization of semantic graph is presented to the users to help browsing search results from related terms in the semantic graph . The search results are ranked each time according to their relevance to the related terms in the entire query session . Comparing to two popular commercial search engines , a user study of 18 users on 50 search terms showed better user satisfactions and indicated the potential usefulness of proposed method in real world search applications .

INTRODUCTION We propose to utilize the collaborative knowledge of human beings stored on Wikipedia[1 ] to generate semantic graphs of suggested search terms . A semantic graph of a given search term is centered on the term , and there are tons of related search terms that link to each other with various weights on the links . It is similar to an ego centric social network but uses terms to replace people in nodes . We propose to use an important hidden network , which links Wikipedia ’s contributors ( ie , article editors ) to key terms on Wikipedia pages , to consider the relatedness of terms as well as how close the terms are . In our work , the calculation of the relatedness of two terms does not base on whether the terms are

Our hypothesis is that when a single editor contributes to two articles in which the two terms occurred separately , there is certain likelihood that these two terms are somehow related based on high clustering coefficients of social networks . We thus draw a complex semantic graph between contributors and terms and conduct to one dimensional graphs with weighted links . We propose a Collective Intelligent based Term Suggestion ( CITS ) system , which provides novel semantic related term suggestions as semantic graphs . The rest of this paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we present our framework of semantic graph based term suggestion functions . User evaluation results of the proposed system are reported in Section 3 . Finally , conclusions and future work directions are provided in Section 4 . 2 . A FRAMEWORK FOR PROVIDING SEMANTIC TERM SUGGESTION Each Wikipedia document contains related terms which form a kind of conceptual network . For each article , all versions and corresponding contributors are stored . Social networks of contributors and their edited articles can then be formed . These two networks provide basic elements for computing semantic relatedness . We crawled thousands of Wikipedia articles to obtain hyperlinks and contributors’ information from editorial histories for constructing the relationships between terms . Beginning from each topic page , we crawled all of the topic ’s internal links to create a concept network . In addition , for each article a record of all contributors and their editorial histories is maintained in Wikipedia . We identified the relationships between these articles and their respective contributions as a new type of network , a specific bipartite network . hyperlinks linked to Wii related terms , within the articles , focused on different topics such as “ Nintendo ” and “ Xbox 360 , ” which are
Let us consider a topic “ Tm = Wii ” and its related articles as an example , we treat “ Wii ” not just as a topic but also as a key term which we denote as T(cid:2923 ) . Beside “ Wii ” , there are many internal denoted asT(cid:2923)H(cid:2919 ) . So , a set of Wii related terms can be created and is denoted asT(cid:2923)(cid:4668)T(cid:2923),T(cid:2923)H(cid:3117),T(cid:2923)H(cid:3118),(cid:1710),T(cid:2923)H(cid:3172)(cid:4669 ) . We editorial history RT(cid:2923)(cid:4668)RT(cid:2923)H(cid:3116),RT(cid:2923)H(cid:3117),RT(cid:2923)H(cid:3118),(cid:1710),RT(cid:2923)H(cid:3172)(cid:4669 ) of T(cid:2923 ) , where RT(cid:2923)H denotes the set of records corresponding toT(cid:2923)H(cid:3167 ) . On the the relationship network among internal hyperlinks as the concept network .
For each article , we examine the latest 500 revisions of article ’s basis of this information provided by Wikipedia , we designed a parser to ignore anonymous contributor so we can see all of the real contributors who have contributed to those specific set of topics . After lists of this procedure , we can create identify

The topic contributor bipartite graph can be represented
For a topic contributor bipartite graph consisting of n topics and m contributors , we can express the editing relationship by a binary
We group together all of the terms contributed by a group of contributors as an effective sampling . Indeed , the number of all of the terms contributed by this group of contributors CTm is definitely larger than the number of specific related terms Tm . Each contributor may have his diverse interests . Thus , this grouping procedure reflects the semantic relatedness buried in human behavior . This step introduces a useful sampling scheme for semantic relatedness and paves a way to locate important information inside the human centric concept and thus extend the relatedness of each term . asGTC(cid:1568)(cid:1731)VT(cid:3397)V(cid:2913),ETC(cid:1732 ) , whereVTT(cid:4668)t(cid:2919)(cid:4669 ) andVCC ( cid:4668)c(cid:2919)(cid:4669)denote the vertices of topics and contributors , respectively . matrixBTC(cid:3427)b(cid:2919)(cid:2920)(cid:3431)(cid:2923)(cid:3400)(cid:2924 ) , where the element b(cid:2919)(cid:2920)(cid:2880)(cid:3420),(cid:2919)(cid:2916 ) ( cid:2930)(cid:2918)(cid:2915 ) ( cid:2919)(cid:3178)(cid:3166)(cid:2913)(cid:2925)(cid:2924)(cid:2928)(cid:2919)(cid:2912)(cid:2931)(cid:2930)(cid:2925)(cid:2928 ) ( cid:2918)(cid:2911)(cid:2929 ) ( cid:2915)(cid:2914)(cid:2919)(cid:2930)(cid:2915)(cid:2914 ) ( cid:2930)(cid:2918)(cid:2915 ) ( cid:2920)(cid:3178)(cid:3166)(cid:2930)(cid:2925)(cid:2926)(cid:2919)(cid:2913 ) , More specifically , the i(cid:2930)(cid:2918 ) row vector,b(cid:2919)(cid:1568)(cid:3419)b(cid:2919)(cid:3117),b(cid:2919)(cid:3118),(cid:1710),b(cid:2919)(cid:3172)(cid:3423 ) , of i(cid:2930)(cid:2918)contributor or not . We then fold this bipartite graph into a topic number of common members between contributor vectors b(cid:2919 ) , b(cid:2920 ) W(cid:2919)(cid:2920)∑ b(cid:2920)(cid:2921)b(cid:2920)·b(cid:2920)T , ( 2 ) µ(cid:2921)(cid:2880 ) that is , the value of W(cid:2919)(cid:2920 ) is computed by the inner product of b(cid:2919 ) and b(cid:2920 ) . This measurement can be generalized to the whole matrix BTC . W(cid:2923)(cid:3400)(cid:2924)BTCBTC(cid:2955 ) ( 3 )
So the weights of the corresponding semantic graph can be expressed by
BTC denotes whether the topics have been edited by the only graph , which is called the semantic graph , by identifying the via the following formula

3 . EVALUATIONS OF CITS SYSTEM Table 1 shows a comparison example of the related terms constructed from the proposed method and from the WordNet [ 2 ] . We can see that the proposed method is arguably closer to most users’ perception today . We take “ Number Theory ” as a testing example and compare with Google [ 3 ] . When keying in “ number theory ” into CITS , the words like “ Chinese remainder theory ” , “ Fermat ’s little theory ” , “ Prime number theory ” , “ Riemann zeta function ” , and “ Goldbach's conjecture ” , were listed in the suggestion box . But , among the suggested words providing by Google , we can only find words “ Number theory web ” that is conceptually relevant .

Eighteen students were invited to test 50 search terms and compared with the search recommendations with Google and Yahoo! [ 4 ] . Examples of the query terms included “ number theory ” , “ solar energy ” , “ encryption ” , and “ complex network ” , etc . The experiment showed that 21 % users think CITS is much better , 47 % better , 10 % the same , 17 % worse , and 5 % much worse , as compared with Google . Yahoo! has provided two kinds of term suggestions . One of them makes more like a wordcompletion suggestion and the other , called “ Explore concepts ” , also a conceptual term suggestion mechanism . User studies on the basis of the same group of participants showed for wordcompletion approach : 12 % users think CITS is much better , 41 % better , 15 % the same , 27 % worse , and 5 % much worse , as compared with Yahoo! . Compare with the Yahoo! ’s Explore Concepts approach , users studies showed 8 % think CITS is much better , 39 % better , 35 % the same , 15 % worse , and 3 % much worse . A demo site is at http://wwwcmlabcsientuedutw/CITS/ 4 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS In this paper , we propose a new framework for performing human centric searches with complex semantic relatedness . We see a potential advantage in using such semantic graphs for various search tasks in people ’s daily search activities . Compared with WordNet , our approach leverages knowledge bases that are orders of magnitude larger and more comprehensive . Compared with commercial search engines such as Google and Yahoo! , CITS results in better semantic related search suggestions , and is thus more activated due to its usage of real time Wikipedia based social network structures . Our future work will focus on enhancing CITS ’s search capabilities by adding personalization and trend prediction to the design . 5 . References [ 1 ] Wikipedia , http://enwikipediaorg/ [ 2 ] C .
