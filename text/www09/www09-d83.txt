ABSTRACT Online social networking sites like MySpace , Facebook , and Flickr have become a popular way to share and disseminate content . Their massive popularity has led to viral marketing techniques that attempt to spread content , products , and ideas on these sites . However , there is little data publicly available on viral propagation in the real world and few studies have characterized how information spreads over current online social networks .
In this paper , we collect and analyze large scale traces of information dissemination in the Flickr social network . Our analysis , based on crawls of the favorite markings of 2.5 million users on 11 million photos , aims at answering three key questions : ( a ) how widely does information propagate in the social network ? ( b ) how quickly does information propagate ? and ( c ) what is the role of word of mouth exchanges between friends in the overall propagation of information in the network ? Contrary to viral marketing “ intuition , ” we find that ( a ) even popular photos do not spread widely throughout the network , ( b ) even popular photos spread slowly through the network , and ( c ) information exchanged between friends is likely to account for over 50 % of all favoritemarkings , but with a significant delay at each hop .

INTRODUCTION
1 . Online social networking has recently become a popular way to share and disseminate information . Users of websites like MySpace , Flickr , and Facebook create networks of friends . They share , find , and disseminate content at a massive scale . Every minute , ten hours of video are uploaded to YouTube [ 31 ] ; Flickr contains over two billion photos [ 26 ] . As a result of their massive popularity , these sites have been exploited as a platform for the viral Copyright is held by the International World Wide Web Conference Committee ( IW3C2 ) . Distribution of these papers is limited to classroom use , and personal use by others . WWW 2009 , April 20–24 , 2009 , Madrid , Spain . ACM 978 1 60558 487 4/09/04 . marketing of content , products , and political campaigns . For instance , major movie studios place trailers for their movies on MySpace ; US presidential candidates ran online political campaigns on YouTube ; and individuals and amateur artists promote their songs , artwork , and blogs through these sites , all hoping to reach millions of online users . Despite the excitement , neither the characteristics of information propagation in social networks nor the mechanisms by which information is exchanged are well understood .
One of the distinguishing features of online social networks is the potential for information dissemination along the social links , ie , information propagation among friends in social networks , one hop at a time . It is widely believed that such user to user exchanges , also known as “ word of mouth ” exchanges , can spread content , ideas , or information widely and quickly throughout the network . In fact , a number of research efforts [ 7 , 8 , 11 , 12 , 24 , 30 ] have proposed viral marketing campaigns to exploit the word of mouth effect . In 2007 , $1.2 billion was spent on advertisement in online social networks worldwide , and this amount is expected to triple by 2011 [ 4 ] . However , to date , there is little data publicly available on viral propagation in the real world and only a few studies [ 1,10,15 ] have been conducted to characterize how information spreads over current online social networks .
In this paper , we collect and analyze large scale traces of information dissemination in the Flickr social network . Flickr , founded in 2004 and acquired by Yahoo! in 2005 , is an online social network for sharing photos . We crawled the social network to gather information from 2.5 million Flickr users and 33 million links between them . To capture the dynamics of information propagation , we crawled the social network for 104 consecutive days . In addition , we collect information about what photos these 2.5 million users marked as favorites and when they did so . We conduct an in depth study of these data sets to determine how pictures spread through the Flickr social network.1
We analyzed the data to answer three key questions :
1 . How widely does information spread in the Flickr social network ? Do popular pictures gather fans from different parts of the network or is their popularity limited to a certain region ?
2 . How quickly does information spread through the social network ? How long after the upload of a photo do fans mark it as a favorite ?
3 . Does information in Flickr flow along its social network links ? What fraction of a photo ’s fans discovered the photo through a friend ? How long does this process take ? By what other mechanisms do fans discover their favorite photos ?

WWW 2009 MADRID!Track : Social Networks and Web 2.0 / Session : Diffusion and Search in Social Networks721 Our data analysis reveals several interesting facts about information propagation in Flickr . We find that most information does not spread widely throughout the network : while it is intuitive that many “ personal interest ” photos of an individual ’s family and friends will have highly localized appeal , we find that even the more popular photos have substantially limited popularity outside the immediate network neighborhood of the uploader . We also find that information spreads slowly in the network ; even the most popular photos exhibit a slow , steady growth in popularity over a long period of time ( 1 2 years ) . Our findings suggest that over 50 % of users find their favorite pictures ( ie , pictures they bookmark ) from their friends in the social network . However , there is a significant delay ( often several months ) in the propagation of information across friend links .
Our findings are in conflict with our initial expectation that information would spread widely and quickly in a viral fashion across the social network . Our observations about high content locality ( ie , even top popular photos did not spread widely ) may be related to the burnout process in the theory of information diffusion [ 25 , 27 , 30 ] . The slow pace of information propagation might reflect the challenges in finding relevant information from an overwhelming volume of information individuals get exposed to , even from their immediate friends . Our results , while preliminary , may have implications not only for the designers of viral marketing campaigns , but also for the mechanisms for finding information that social networking sites offer , and promote .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . We describe our measurement methodology and introduce our data set in Section 2 . We present characteristics of the Flickr social network that are relevant to information propagation in Section 3 . We present analyses of how picture popularity is distributed over the network topology in Section 4 and how they evolve over time in Section 5 , respectively . Section 6 investigates the role of social links in information propagation . In Section 7 , we discuss possible explanations for our findings . We summarize related work in Section 8 and conclude in Section 9 .
2 . MEASUREMENT METHODOLOGY In this section , we introduce the Flickr website and describe our data collection methodology . 2.1 Flickr Flickr is a photo sharing site with social networking features , where users can create friend relationships with one another and share photos . Users can create networks of friends , join groups , send messages to other users , comment on photos , tag photos , and choose their favorite photos . To use most of these features , users must create a Flickr account and they must be logged in to Flickr . Flickr provides users with privacy control over photos they upload , allowing photos to be classified as either private , visible only to their friends , or , the default , public .
Flickr allows users to create two types of links : links to favorite photos ( called favorites in Flickr ) and links to other users ( called contacts in Flickr ) . We refer to users in the contacts list as friends in this paper . Like bookmarks , users may “ favorite mark ” a photo to archive and share interesting photos with others . We refer to users who include a photo in their favorite photos list as fans of that photo . The list of a user ’s favorite photos and the list of a user ’s contacts are both available from a user ’s profile page . This paper focuses on these two features of Flickr .
2.2 Data collection methodology We describe our Flickr data collection methodology . Since we were interested in studying the dynamics of information flow in a largescale social network , we needed to collect ( a ) the evolving state of the social network and ( b ) evidence of information propagation from one user to another . Here we describe our methodology for collecting both types of information .
In order to collect the state of the social network , we crawled a significant subset of the Flickr online social network . We started with a randomly selected Flickr user and followed all of the friends links in the forward direction in a breadth first search fashion . In this way , we collected a “ snowball" sample of the Flickr social network . The list of contacts for each user is publicly visible in Flickr , and we used the Flickr API to reduce the necessary bandwidth for crawling . Our snowball sample is part of a large weakly connected component of the entire Flickr network that is reachable from the seed user ; we call our sampled data the Flickr social network graph . To capture the dynamics of friends’ relationships , we launched a complete crawl of the social network graph once per day . We visited all users in the previous day ’s social network graph and recorded any newly created or removed friend links or users .
Finally , to collect evidence of information flow over a social network , we collected information on the favorite photos of the Flickr users . Favorites photos are publicly visible from each user ’s profile page . We used the Flickr API to download the list of favorite photos for all known users , based on the final snapshot of our Flickr social network graph . Because Flickr provides information about the exact timestamp when a user marked a photo as a favorite , this allowed us to recreate favorite marking events over the dynamically evolving social network graphs . Moreover , for favorite markings that occurred during our repeated crawls of the social network , we know the state of the social network at the time the favorite marking took place . From this , we can examine the social network factors which influenced the favorite marking user .
2.3 Data description We crawled the Flickr social network graph once per day for the period of 104 consecutive days from November 2–December 3 , 2006 and February 3–May 18 , 2007 . We observed 2.5 million Flickr users and 33 million links , an estimated 25 % of the entire Flickr network . We refer the readers to our previous work [ 21 , 22 ] for data analysis on the general properties and growth patterns of the network . In this paper we also collected information about 34 million favorite markings over 11 million distinct photos .

2.4 Limitations Although this data gives us a unique opportunity to examine information spread dynamics over social links , it has several limitations . First , our methodology does not take into account any deleted favorite marking . However , informal reports from Flickr users suggest that users rarely delete any of their favorite marked photos . Furthermore , this does not affect our analysis results because deleted favorite markings can no longer spread via a social network .

Second , we do not know how a user was exposed to a photo prior to favorite marking . There are many possibilities : visiting friends’ pages , browsing featured photos , visiting external web pages , or finding via search engine . However , we do not know which mechanisms are responsible for which users’ favorite markings . Thus , we use a heuristic to infer whether a user found photos through social links .
Finally , we can only observe the network , but we cannot manipulate it . We are not able to make changes to the Flickr website or run tests in a controlled environment . For example , we cannot test whether Flickr would see an increase in traffic if we were to add a specific feature or create links between certain photos or users .
3 . NETWORK TOPOLOGY AND
PICTURE POPULARITY
In this section , we present an overview of the Flickr social network . We first describe the small world pattern seen in the Flickr network topology , which is characterized by a strong local clustering and a small diameter . These structural properties are important because they indicate how widely information can propagate through the network . After presenting structural properties , we describe various popularity metrics that could be used for pictures in Flickr , and discuss why we chose to focus on the number of fans .
3.1 Social network topology We begin by examining the degree distributions of the 2.5 million users . We construct the Flickr social graph such that each node represents a Flickr user and edges between nodes represent friend links . A user can unilaterally declare and point to any other user as a friend in Flickr , ie , friends links are unidirectional . Thus , we represent the network as a directed graph . We refer to the number of friends a user declares and points to as the outdegree of the user and the number of other users that point to the user as a friend as the indegree of the user . In Flickr , most links are reciprocal ; 68 % of the links are bidirectional . The Pearson ’s correlation coefficient between a node ’s indegree and outdegree is 0.76 , indicating that a user with many outdegree links is also likely to have many indegree links .
Figure 2 shows the in and out degree distributions of the 2.5 million users . A majority of users are connected to only a few other users . In fact , 55 % of the nodes have just 1 outgoing link and 90 % of them have an outdegree smaller than 10 . The average outdegree was 14 . However , a few nodes have tens of thousands of links ; the node with the highest number of outgoing links has 26,342 friends . The indegree distribution is similar , but the maximum indegree is smaller than the maximum outdegree . x

Figure 2 : Node degree distribution
We examine two important structural properties of the social network graph : path lengths and clustering coefficient . The maximum path length between any two nodes in the network ( ie , diameter ) is 27 , while the average path length is 567 The clustering coefficient measures how tightly the neighbors of a node are interlinked . It can range from 0 to 1 , where 0 means there is no connection between neighbors and 1 means a clique . For well connected nodes in Flickr the clustering coefficient is typically between 0.05 to 0.1 , and for poorly connected it is typically between 0.2 and 0.4 [ 22 ] .
The small world network properties have implications for information flow . For example , users with high indegree and outdegree can potentially receive and transmit information more widely . The observed small world network structure indicates that most Flickr users are separated by only a few hops and that information can be retrieved over short network paths [ 29 ] . In summary , the Flickr social structure exhibits properties that promise wide spread dissemination of popular information throughout the network .
3.2 Picture popularity In Flickr , users can view pictures , leave comments on pictures they find interesting , or favorite mark pictures they like . Consequently , there are different metrics possible for ranking pictures ; they can be ranked based on their popularity in terms of the number of views , fans , or comments . Figure 1 shows the popularity distributions for the 11 million pictures based on these three metrics . All three distributions show a heavy tailed distribution . For example , the distribution of fan popularity shows that millions of pictures have fewer than 10 fans in the entire network , while an order of magnitude fewer pictures ( 252,126 ) have more than one thousand fans . This means that only a small fraction of pictures achieve high popularity and thus have the potential to spread widely through the social network .
WWW 2009 MADRID!Track : Social Networks and Web 2.0 / Session : Diffusion and Search in Social Networks723 Views of pictures tend to be two orders of magnitude higher than fans or comments . To understand the relationship between the number of views , comments , and fans , we measure the strength of a linear relationship between these values ( ie , correlation coefficient ) . The correlation coefficient ranges from 1 to 1 , where values close to 1 suggest a positive linear relationship , values close to 1 suggests negative linear relationship , and values close to 0 suggest there is no linear relationship between the data points . The number of views is not strongly correlated with the number of comments ( 0.13 ) or the number of fans ( 023 ) On the other hand , the number of comments pictures receive is highly correlated with the number of fans ( 060 ) This may be because leaving comments on pictures or marking them as favorites takes time . So users are likely to leave comments or favorite mark only those pictures they find interesting , which would explain the high correlation between the number of fans and the number of comments .
More interestingly , the correlation between views and fans is weaker for popular pictures ; the correlation coefficient decreases to 0.21 for pictures with over 100 fans and falls to 0.13 for pictures with over 1,000 fans . The low correlation between the number of view and fans could indicate that users find many of the pictures they view uninteresting . The low correlation may also arise because any web user can view a Flickr picture , but users need to register with Flickr and login to favorite mark or comment on pictures .
In this paper , we focus on the fan popularity of pictures . Specifically , we study how widely and quickly pictures are favoritemarked throughout the network . We believe our analysis demonstrates how pictures that are of interest to users spread through the social network . However , our findings might not apply to the spread of picture views , because we do not have information about when which user viewed which photo in Flickr . ( We only know the total view counts per photo . )
4 . TOPOLOGICAL DISTRIBUTION OF
PICTURE POPULARITY
We investigate how widely all the fans of a particular picture is distributed over its social network topology . The key question we want to answer is , how widely does information in the form of a favorite marking propagate through the social network ? We first analyze whether the popularity of Flickr pictures is global or confined to local regions in the network . We then study the distribution of fans as a function of their distance from the uploaders .
4.1 Local versus global picture popularity To understand how well the local popularity of pictures in different regions of the network correlates with their global popularity , we determine the most popular pictures ( we call this set a hotlist ) in several local neighborhoods and compared them with the global hotlist of pictures . We assume that if pictures spread widely throughout the network then we will see a good match between the local and global hotlists of pictures . However , if the popularity is localized to a specific region and shows strong topological correlation , the global and local hotlists will vary substantially .
For the test , we randomly picked 250 users ( or seed nodes ) from the set of 2.5 million users who have favorite marked at least one photo , and identified the top 100 pictures from the neighborhood of each seed node . We visited the 4 hop neighborhood around each of these seed nodes , based on the final snapshot of the network . Table 2 shows the neighborhoods of our 250 seed users . Increasingly , more nodes are reached as we increase the neighborhood bound ary . Within 4 hops , our seed nodes reached on average 1,563,500 nodes , which is nearly 36 % of our entire Flickr social network .

Max . 2,816 290,671 1,159,636 1,667,054
For each of the neighborhoods , we identified the top 100 pictures based on the number of fans from that region and compared the list with the globally popular top 100 pictures . We then determine the number of photos that appear in both lists , the “ overlap . ” Figure 3 shows the overlap between the two lists . Along the horizontal axis , we sort the neighborhoods based on the number of common photos . The one hop neighborhood plot shows that , for 233 of the 250 local regions , there was no overlap between the local and global hotlists . The largest overlap was 19 pictures . The overlap between local and global hotlists increases as we consider wider neighborhood boundaries . Hotlists based on a 2 hop neighborhood boundary showed on average 8 globally popular pictures ; while the 3and 4 hop neighborhoods showed much larger overlaps of 39 and 70 , respectively .

Figure 3 : Resemblance in local and global hotlists
We make two key observations . First , the difference between global and local hotlists indicates that different pieces of information are popular among the different social network regions . Based on 1 or 2 hop neighborhoods , hotlists of pictures are localized . That is , these pictures were not widely available throughout the network . Second , focusing on the 4 hop neighborhood , we are able to see a high overlap in global and local hotlists . This is because this neighborhood covers a large number of nodes—36 % of the entire graph . This also means that information is reachable within few hops ( ie , small world network ) . 4.2 Distance from fans to picture uploaders Motivated by high content locality , we look at the distance between fans and photo uploaders . We examine two quantities : ( a ) the fraction of fans that are located 1 , 2 , or 3 or more hops away from the uploaders and ( b ) the fraction of nodes that become fans of the pictures ( as a function of the distance from the uploader ) . Calculating these distances for all 34 million favorite markings on a 2.5 million node network is time intensive . Therefore , we chose a subset of pictures from our data set for analysis . To pick representative pictures , we chose all pictures that were uploaded after November 2nd , 2007 , and all of their fans as our target set . This set includes 3 million pictures and 10 million favorite markings .
WWW 2009 MADRID!Track : Social Networks and Web 2.0 / Session : Diffusion and Search in Social Networks724 We first investigate the distance from fans of photos to their uploaders . Table 3 shows the percentage of fans that are k hops away from uploaders . We observe strong locality across all popularity level . For less popular photos , 91 % of all fans are within 2 hops of the uploaders . But even for top popular photos , 81 % of all fans are within 2 hops of uploaders . It is intuitive that globally less popular photos exhibit strong locality , since these are typically personal photos of family and friends , which are by definition interesting primarily to people pictured in the photo and those who know them . However , it is surprising to us that popular pictures with more than 500 fans also show a high level of content locality .

One potential concern with the above analysis is the vastly different k hop neighborhood sizes around different uploaders , making it hard to compare the distribution for different photos . We therefore also calculated the fraction of the each k hop neighborhood that became fans of the photo . Thus , we visited each and every user that is k hops from the respective uploaders and counted how many of them have favorite marked the picture . Because visiting neighborhoods is also time intensive , we limited our study to pictures with more than 100 fans . Table 4 shows the fraction of an uploader ’s k hop friends that are fans . Across all popularity levels , 1 2 % of neighbors eventually become fans of the uploaders’ pictures . In 2 and 3 hop neighborhoods , a much smaller fraction of nodes become fans . This suggests that propagation of favoritemarked photos throughout the network is limited and that photos rarely spread beyond the immediate vicinity of the uploaders .

4.3 Summary In this section , we presented data analysis of 34 million favorite markings of 11 million pictures in the Flickr social network . We examined the correlation between the locations of favorite marking and the social structure of users , based on the topology that existed on the last day of our crawl . We found that different sets of pictures are popular in different parts of the social network and that photo fans are closely located to the uploaders . These observations demonstrate that information does not propagate widely in the Flickr social network .
5 . TEMPORAL EVOLUTION OF
PICTURE POPULARITY
In this section , we study how the popularity of pictures evolves over time , ie , how quickly fans favorite mark pictures after they are uploaded . We first study how four sample pictures accumulated fans over time to identify various patterns of growth in picture popularity . We then analyze the dominant patterns in the long term evolution of popularity across all pictures . 5.1 Patterns of popularity growth To understand patterns in the evolution of picture popularity , we focused on the pictures with the most number of fans . We examined the growth patterns in the 30 most popular pictures in Flickr . We also visited each photo ’s web page to gather additional information about potential external links to the photo , for instance , whether the photo had been featured on the front page of Flickr or whether it had received a photography award .
From these 30 pictures , we selected four representative photos and show how their popularity evolves over time in Figure 4 . At a first glance , the four photos show different growth curves . However , their growth curves exhibit one or more of the following three distinct growth phases , which we call active growth , surgeincrease , and sluggish . Photo A experienced an active growth in popularity over the course of 563 days , eventually acquiring 2,144 fans . Photo B ’s popularity evolved differently from Photo A ’s . Photo B stayed dormant and unknown to many Flickr users for nearly 272 days after it was uploaded ; it gained only 10 fans by day 230 . Then on day 272 , the photo won a national photo contest and was linked from several external web pages . Almost immediately the photo witnessed a growth spike and received 244 new fans on a single day! Over the next 50 days the photo continued to gain fans , but on day 325 the photo again became sluggish .
The popularity growth of Photo C shows sluggishness , surgeincrease , and active growth . After it was uploaded , the photo went through a sluggish period before day 40 . As the photo slowly started gaining fans , it was featured on the front page of Flickr on day 57.2 Once it was featured , the photo saw a spike in its popularity ; it obtained over 200 fans by day 70 . Then , it shifted into a long period of active , steady growth for nearly an year . Finally , Photo D ’s popularity shows two surge increases , once at day 0 and another at day 313 , and both increases are followed by extended periods of steady growth . On day 0 , the photo was featured on Flickr ’s Explore page . The initial growth rate of photo popularity is influenced by how users link to the photo ’s uploader . The uploaders of Photo A and Photo D had 5,178 and 4,893 incoming links , respectively . This may explain why their pictures became instantly known to others as soon as the photo was uploaded . In contrast , the uploaders of Photo B and C had substantially fewer incoming links ( 289 and 966 respectively ) , and thus initially experienced much slower growth in popularity .
In summary , the popularity of individual pictures evolves differently . However , their growth curves share three key common patterns : sluggishness , surge increase , and active growth . The relative importance of each pattern differs across photos . For instance , Photo B gained most of its fans through its surge increase , whereas Photo C gained most of its fans during an active growth . Interestingly , most of the 30 popular pictures showed an active growth pattern that is linear over an extended period of time . This steady linear growth in popularity cannot be easily explained by traditional information diffusion theories [ 25 , 27 ] , which predict an exponential growth in popularity followed by a saturation or maturity . We discuss potential explanations for this discrepancy in Section 7 . 5.2 Long term trends in popularity growth How does photo popularity evolve over a long period of time ? Which growth pattern is dominant in a time period of a year or 2Flickr uses an internal algorithm to choose interesting pictures to feature .

Figure 4 : Popularity growth pattern of sample photos longer ? To answer these questions , we examined the aggregate growth patterns of two subsets of photos : photos that are older than 1 year and photos that are older than 2 years . We considered only popular pictures that had at least 100 or more fans by the end of their first year and their second year . There were 5,346 and 897 such pictures . Similarly , we focused on only the fans acquired during the first or the second year after the picture was uploaded .

Figure 5 : Popularity growth patterns over a long term period
We examine the long term popularity trend of the two sets of photos . Figure 5(a ) shows the growth in popularity of 5,346 pic tures that are older than 1 year . The horizontal axis represents the age of the photo , or the time since the pictures’ uploads . The vertical axis represents the fraction of fans a photo obtained by the given age , out of the total number of fans it obtained at the end of the first year . We show the 10th percentile , the median , and the 90th percentile growth rates for all 5,346 pictures for every day of the 1 year period . Similarly , Figure 5(b ) shows the growth in popularity of pictures that are older than 2 years . This figure plots data for 897 pictures .
We make two key observations from the above figures about the long term trends in popularity growth of pictures . First , in aggregate , many photos do show an active rise in popularity during the first few days after they are uploaded . Second , after the first few ( 10 20 ) days , most pictures , in aggregate , enter a period of steady linear growth . Surprisingly , the linear growth is sustained over extended periods of time—the median growth rate does not show any sign of slowing down even after 1 or 2 years . As a result of this linear growth pattern , the fans these pictures obtained during the first few days accounts for an ever decreasing fraction of total fans . For a majority of pictures , over 40 % of fans were acquired after the first 100 days . Conversely , our analysis suggests that Flickr users take a long period of time to find out about interesting pictures .
We also analyzed the trends in popularity growth for less popular pictures , ie , pictures with fewer than 100 fans ( not shown in Figure 5 ) . Unlike popular pictures that exhibit a steady growth pattern in their fan population , a majority of the less popular photos attract their limited fan population early on during their lifetime , and they become dormant after the first few months .
5.3 Summary In this section , we studied how popularity grows over a long period of time . Existing models of information diffusion predict an exponential growth in popularity . In contrast , our data shows a steady linear growth pattern for the most popular pictures . Our data also reveals different paths to popularity , comprised of active growth , surge increase , and sluggishness .

INFORMATION PROPAGATION VIA SOCIAL LINKS
In this section , we first describe the various mechanisms by which people can find content in Flickr . We then investigate the role played by one specific mechanism , namely , the exchange of information between friends , in propagating favorite markings over the Flickr social network . 6.1 Dissemination mechanisms In Flickr , people can find pictures through various mechanisms . We list some of the important ones below .
• Featuring . Flickr officially provides two key features : one is the front page and the other is the Explore page3 which is the list of photos selected by Flickr as “ interesting . ”
• Search results . Users may search for specific content within Flickr . Content meta data such as titles , tags , and descriptions are used by the Flickr photo search engine to identify relevant content .
• Links between content . Flickr provides links between picture pages that allow users to easily navigate the website . Examples are “ sets , ” which are groups of similar pictures by the same uploader , and “ pools ” , which include photos uploaded by different users , but that have common themes .
• External links . Users can reach Flickr photos from external websites , blogs , emails , and other mechanisms external to the Flickr website .
• Social network . Flickr users find new pictures that are up loaded or shared by their friends .
In the rest of this section , we focus on the dissemination of content via social network links in Flickr . Undoubtedly , other mechanisms are also at play , but studying their influence requires a richer data set and is beyond the scope of this paper . 6.2 Identifying social cascades Information can travel widely through a social network one hop at a time via word of mouth exchanges between friends in the network . We refer to such information dissemination as a social cascade . Without a page view trace or asking the user directly , we cannot say for sure how users in Flickr found photos . So we used a heuristic to infer the cases when Flickr users are likely to have discovered pictures using their friends links . Our heuristic uses the state of the social network at the time of the favorite marking to make an educated guess about how a new fan might have found the photo . In particular , we say that user A found a photo P through the social
3http://wwwflickrcom/explore/ network if and only if there exists a user B who is a friend of A such that :
• B also marked P as a favorite , • B included photo P on his favorite list before A included photo P on his favorite list , and
• B was a friend of A before A made photo P his favorite .
The above conditions state that B must be A ’s friend before A found the photo , and that B must have already favorite marked the photo before A found it . If all of these conditions hold , then we consider the photo to have propagated from B to A via a social link . Our definition may identify multiple friends from whom A could have found the photo . For this work , we assume A received information about the photo from all of these users . Finally , Flickr users cannot mark the pictures they uploaded as favorites . For the purpose of our analysis , we consider uploaders as fans of their pictures by default . To apply the above test , we need to know the social network graph at the time when photos are marked as favorites . We use the data from our daily snapshots of the Flickr network to recreate the state of the network on each of the 104 days it was crawled . Thus , we are able to infer the role of social links in transmitting favoritemarking information only for the favorite markings made during the 104 days . We further limited our analysis to the set of photos that were uploaded during the period of our crawl as this guarantees that its entire popularity history is known to us . This leaves us with 10,025,185 favorite markings over 3,055,361 pictures . 6.3 The role of social cascades We examined the fraction of favorite markings that spread through social links in Flickr . Table 5 summarizes the role of social cascades in the spread of favorite markings . We grouped pictures based on their popularity to determine whether we observe social cascades for both popular and unpopular pictures . Table 5 shows the number of pictures in each popularity level and their number of favorite markings ( ie , fans ) . Out of 3 million pictures , nearly 2.7 million of them ( 88 % ) obtained no more than 5 favorite markings , while 3,685 pictures gained more than 100 fans during the daily crawl period . This skewed popularity of pictures also matches the heavy tailed popularity distribution over a long term period ( Section 32 )
Columns grouped as social cascade in Table 5 represent the set of pictures and fans that were identified as being part of a social cascade . Overall , out of the more than 10 million total favorite markings , 5 million or 53 % of all favorite markings were propagated through social links , suggesting that a crucial role is likely played by the social network in information propagation . The remaining fans might have found the pictures through various other mechanisms . Social cascade plays a significant role in propagating information for both popular and unpopular pictures . The fraction
WWW 2009 MADRID!Track : Social Networks and Web 2.0 / Session : Diffusion and Search in Social Networks727 of social cascade favorite markings remains consistently high , varying from 43 % to 55 % across the different popularity ranges . Thus , social links play an important role in transmitting information , independent of its popularity .
While aggregate statistics show that a consistently high fraction of social cascades in the spread of favorite markings , individual pictures vary from this pattern . Figure 6 shows that varying fractions of favorite markings are part of social cascades for different pictures . The horizontal axis represents the photo popularity , ie , the number of fans a photo received , and the vertical axis represents the percentage of favorite markings that spread through social links for the group of pictures with similar popularity . The horizontal axis is in a log scale . The fraction of social cascade based favoritemarking is shown for every 10th percentile values . The three solid lines indicate the minimum , the median , and the maximum values . The median plot shows similar values as observed in Table 5 . Across all popularity ranges , individual pictures benefit from information propagation through social links to varying degrees .

Social cascades are based on word of mouth and could potentially reach far and wide throughout the network . To understand how widely social cascades spread beyond the first hop from the uploader , we show the fraction of social cascade based favorite markings that are just 1 hop away from the uploaders in the rightmost columns in Table 5 , denoted cascades from uploaders . For pictures with 1 to 5 fans , 2.11 million out of 2.19 million social cascade based favorite markings were from fans 1 hop away from the uploaders . For popular pictures with more than 500 fans , only 4,017 out of 8,686 favorite markings were from fans 1 hop away from the uploaders . These observations suggest that uploaders play a crucial role in the social cascades of less popular pictures , while social cascades of popular pictures spread information beyond the immediate vicinity of the uploader .
6.4 Peer pressure in photo favorite marking We check whether a user ’s tendency to favorite mark a picture is influenced by the number of friends who have previously favoritemarked the same picture . If one has many friends who declare that they “ like ” a given picture , is the user more likely to mark the picture as a favorite in the future ? To answer this question , we focused on the set of 3,685 pictures with more than 100 fans . We examined the number of times users were exposed to those pictures through their 1 hop friends and counted how many of them later became fans of those pictures . Figure 7 shows the result , where the probability of becoming a fan is shown as a function of the number of friends who have already favorite marked the picture . The plot shows the average value . n a f i a g n m o c e b f o y t i l i b a b o r P

Figure 7 : The probability of becoming a fan as a function of the number of friends who are already fans of the same picture
The probability of a user becoming a fan of a photo increases with the number of her friends who are already fans of the photo . That is , the behavior of favorite marking is influenced by peers in the social network . Backstrom et al . [ 3 ] also found a similar relationship in their study of LiveJournal and DBLP data , where the probability of joining a community increased as the number of friends who are already in the community increased . 6.5 Time taken for social cascade hops Finally , we look at how long it takes for information to propagate along each hop of the social cascade . For each favorite marking that spread over a social link , we examine the time difference between when the favorite marking was made and the earliest time when one of the user ’s friends favorite marked the same picture . When a friend ’s favorite marking precedes the time of link formation with the user , we take the time when the link was formed as the earliest possible time the user was exposed to the picture . Table 6 presents the time taken for information to propagate along a social link in units of days . We only consider favorite marking of pictures with more than 100 fans , users are less likely to be exposed to pictures with few fans . This subset of data accounts for 190,353 favorite markings for 3,685 pictures .
Table 6 shows that some users discovered their friends’ favorite photos and marked them as their favorites the same day that their friends favorite marked them . While not presented in the table , our data shows that 35 % of fans found their favorite marked pictures within a week after friends’ favorite marking of the same picture . However , 50 % of fans took over 60 days to favorite mark their friends’ favorite marked pictures . The average delay in information propagation across a social link is significantly higher exposure at 140 days . One user favorite marked what his friends had already favorite marked after 904 days . These observations indicate that favorite marking information takes a long time to spread across each link in the social network .

6.6 Summary We have examined to what extent information propagates through social links in Flickr . Our analysis suggests that ( a ) social network plays a notable role in Flickr , likely accounting for more than 50 %
WWW 2009 MADRID!Track : Social Networks and Web 2.0 / Session : Diffusion and Search in Social Networks728 of the favorite marking and ( b ) individuals take a long time , typically 3 to 5 months , to favorite mark pictures that their friends had previously listed as favorites .
7 . DISCUSSION In this paper , we have made two key observations : first , most fans of a given picture are within a few hops of the picture uploader and second , pictures spread slowly throughout the social network . These observations contradict our expectations and need to be investigated thoroughly . In this section , we discuss two possible explanations of the high content locality and one potential explanation of delay in the social cascade .
In Section 4 , we showed that most favorite markings for a photo come from the 2 hop neighborhood region of its uploader , which is a small part of the entire Flickr social network . While it is not surprising that personal photos would exhibit high content locality , we have also seen that even popular photos with more than 500 fans have substantially limited popularity beyond a 2 hop neighborhood . One possible explanation for such high content locality is suggested by models of viral marketing . Watts and Peretti [ 30 ] describe a word of mouth marketing model as follows . It starts with “ seeds ” of individuals who spread information by infecting their friends , in a similar fashion to the spread of an infectious disease . The expected number of new infectious generated by each infected person is called the reproduction rate or R . If R > 1 , each person is infecting more than one additional person and the number of infected people will grow exponentially , ie , viral marketing is a success . When R < 1 , initial seeds will quickly burn themselves out after several steps of information spreading . In this case , the final number of infected people will be approximately
N 1 − R
( 1 ) where N is the number of initial seeds . In Flickr , the uploader is often the only seed who actively advertises a photo ( ie , R > 1 ) , and the characteristics of R may change drastically beyond the immediate neighborhood of the uploader ( ie , R fi 1 ) . This may explain high content locality near the uploaders .
Another possible reason for high content locality might be related to homophily in social networks [ 2,6 ] . Homophily is colloquially described by the aphorism “ birds of a feather flock together . ” It refers to the principle that contacts between similar people ( ie , “ birds of a feather ” ) occur at a higher rate than among dissimilar people [ 20 ] . In Flickr , homophily can be explained as follows : people who like each other ’s pictures tend to become friends and people who are friends tend to like each other ’s pictures , thereby ensuring that popularity of pictures is localized , even for top popular pictures .
To see if this is true , we examined what fraction of links , from a user A to a user B , were established after A had favorite marked some of B ’s pictures . From a random selection of 150,000 new links , we found that 27,546 or 18 % of the links were formed after favorite marking the others’ pictures . In 83 % of the cases , A was previously only 2 hops away from B . Still , 17 % of the remaining links indicate that users actively reach out to content creators who were beyond the friend of a friend range . By strategically forming links , users can later visit the web pages of their new friends and follow up on their content .
In Section 5 , we showed that even top popular photos took a long time to propagate from one friend to another . This delay may be related to the rate at which users are exposed to the new pictures bookmarked by their friends . In Flickr , users get a small number of updates about their friends’ newly uploaded pictures when they log in . So the rate of information propagation may be limited by the frequency of user logins . In summary , our findings about high content locality and slow spread of information propagation through social links could potentially be explained by the burnout process in the theory of information diffusion [ 25 , 27 , 30 ] and the frquency with which users are exposed to the information .
8 . RELATED WORK We briefly review related work on theories in information diffusion , viral marketing , and the data analysis of information spreading on online social networks . Studies related to social cascades go as far back as the 1950s [ 25 , 27 ] . Seminal work on persuasive communication , the branching process , and the diffusion of innovations spawned an extensive literature in sociology , economics , social psychology , political science , marketing , and epidemiology [ 19 , 23 , 28 ] . More recently , research on information diffusion has been conducted in light of viral marketing [ 7,11,24 ] and social networks [ 1 , 10 , 12 ] . Especially , Leskovec et al . [ 15 ] studied the cascade characteristics of purchases in a recommendation referral network of a large retailer website . They found that the distribution of the size of cascades followed a power law distribution .
A number of studies focus on the interplay between social structure and information dissemination in real networks [ 2,5,9,13,16– 18 ] . Amongst them , diffusion in blogsphere has been studied based on the keywords [ 10 ] as well as links embedded in blog posts [ 1 ] . Kossinets et al . studied a university email network to identify the information “ backbone , ” where information has the potential to flow the quickest [ 13 ] . Anagnostopoulos et al . examined the spreading of picture tags in Flickr and developed a statistical test to distinguish social influence ( causality ) from correlation [ 2 ] . They found that the choice of tags used by Flickr users is not likely to be due to social influence . Gómez et al . studied the social network that instantly arise on the discussion threads in Slashdot website [ 9 ] . They studied the dissemination tree in respect to identifying how controversial a post was .
The most similar to our work is by Lerman and Jones [ 14 ] . They studied Flickr and also found that the social network played a significant role in photo propagation . They confirmed this by examining the correlation between the number of fans for 1,500 photos and the indegree of uploaders of those pictures . In this work , we have examined the influence of not only the uploaders , but also neighboring fans . We have also examined the detailed spatial and temporal growth patterns of photo popularity .
9 . CONCLUDING REMARKS This paper presented a data analysis of how picture popularity is distributed across the Flickr social network , and characterized the role played by social links in information propagation . We showed empirical evidence that ( a ) social links are the dominant method of information propagation , accounting for more than 50 % of the spread of favorite marked pictures ; ( b ) information spreading is limited to individuals who are within close proximity of the uploaders ; and ( c ) spreading takes a long time at each hop . As a result , we found that content popularity is often localized in the network and popularity of pictures steadily increases over many years .
While the popularity pattern observed is natural for many personal photos , we have also observed similar trends for popular photos with hundreds of fans . Our findings differ from from the common expectations about the quick and wide spread of word ofmouth effect , and they need to be investigated thoroughly .
We would like to extend our work in many directions . First , we would like to understand the mechanisms of user behaviors that
WWW 2009 MADRID!Track : Social Networks and Web 2.0 / Session : Diffusion and Search in Social Networks729 leads to a substantial delay and high content locality in information propagation . Second , we are interested in developing tools and features in Flickr that can enable the full viral spread that the theory suggests is possible . For instance , content may propagate more quickly and widely in a push based system , compared to the pullbased system used in Flickr . Third , we are interested in exploring opportunities for personalized recommendations in Flickr . We have seen that users are interested in local content ( within 2 hop neighborhood ) , but it took a long time to for many users to reach that content . We would like to test the efficacy of recommending photos that are popular within one ’s local neighborhood , rather than from the entire user population ( as Flickr currently provides in the Explore list ) .
