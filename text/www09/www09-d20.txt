ABSTRACT In this paper , we propose to model the blended search problem by assuming conditional dependencies among queries , VSEs and search results . The probability distributions of this model are learned from search engine query log through unigram language model . Our experimental exploration shows that , ( 1 ) a large number of queries in generic Web search have vertical search intentions ; and ( 2 ) our proposed algorithm can effectively blend vertical search results into generic Web search , which can improve the Mean Average Precision ( MAP ) by as much as 16 % compared to traditional Web search without blending .

1 . INTRODUCTION Vertical Search Engine ( VSE ) refers to the search services that target at specific kind of information , such as image , video and news search . In recent years , VSEs have become increasingly effective in serving users with specific needs . Unfortunately , many Web users are still unaware of these high quality vertical search resources . For example , many users enter “ Jennifer Lopez image ” in generic Web search to find images of Jennifer Lopez instead of entering “ Jennifer Lopez ” in Image search . Our study in the search query log of a commercial search engine reveals that the number of generic Web search queries , which have explicit or implicit vertical search intentions , can surpass the traffic of VSEs . As more evidences , we found that 12.3 % of generic Web search queries have strong image search intention and 13.1 % have the news search intention .
To make the value of VSEs aware by search users , many efforts have been made by commercial search engines . Yahoo Shortcut , Ask 3D , MSN Live and Google Universal Search , are all examples of these efforts . However , why and how to blend the vertical search results into generic Web search are still under explored in academia . In this paper , we propose a probabilistic model based approach as a solution to the blended search and show that the blended search can truly help general purpose search engines . As related work , the “ blended search ” can be naturally considered as a meta search problem [ 4 ] . For example , if we treat both generic Web Search and VSEs as component search engines , the blended search is to aggregate the search results from

However , from the classical meta search problem ’s configuration , the query log of component search engines is not available for study . In this extended abstract , we model the blended search problem based on the conditional dependencies among queries , VSEs and all the search results . We utilize the usage information , ie query log , of all the VSEs , which are not available for traditional metasearch engines , to learn the model parameters by the smoothed unigram language model . Finally , given a user query , the search results from both generic Web search and different VSEs are ranked together by inferring their probabilities of relevance to the given query . The main contributions of this work are , ( 1 ) through studying the belonging vertical search engines’ query log of a commercial search engine , we show the importance of blended search problem ; ( 2 ) we propose a novel probabilistic model based approach to explore the blended search problem ; and ( 3 ) we experimentally verify that our proposed algorithm can effectively blend vertical search results into generic Web search , which can improve the MAP as much as 16 % in contrast to traditional Web search without vertical search blending and 10 % to some other some ranking baseline .
2 . MOTIVATIONAL OBSERVATIONS In this section , we show why we study blended search . We utilize 10 days’ vertical search query log and a general Web search query log of a commercial search engine as our dataset . We study five VSEs , which are Image , Video , News , Books and RSS Feeds . If only considering the English queries , the traffic of the five VSEs is only 1.56 % of the Web search traffic . We assume that if a VSE ’s name v appears as part of a query q in two special patterns , then q has the explicit intention to search in VSE v . The two patterns are “ v of something ” and “ something v ” . For example , the queries “ image of Britney Spears ” and “ Britney Spears image ” are assumed to have the explicit image search intentions . Under this assumption , there are 2,766,937 queries ( about 1 % ) having the explicit vertical search intentions to the 5 VSEs in the 10 days’ search query log . We can extent the vertical search engine name v to more related terms in the above assumption . Take the image search VSE as example . If we allow v to be any term in “ image , picture , gallery , wallpaper and pic ” , there are 2,573,911 queries . Note the traffic of image search is 2,106,452 . The number of Web search queries that have explicit image search intentions , have already surpassed the traffic of image search .
To do a more accurate study , we randomly sampled 2,153 generic Web search queries and ask labelers to judge the relevance between queries and search domains , which are Image , Video , News , RSS and Book . We use 4 level labeling with “ 3 ” is “ strong relevant ” and “ 0 ” is “ irrelevant ” . The results are given in Table 1 It is interesting that 12.3 % queries have strong image search intention , 8.5 % have strong video search intention and 13.1 % have strong news search intention . These statistics motivated us to study the blended search .

4 . EXPERIMENTS The dataset used for experiments is the 2,153 labeled queries , which is introduced in section 2 . For each of these queries , its top 10 vertical search results and top 10 generic Web search results are mixed together for the labelers to rank their relevance . A voting strategy is used to determine the data ground truth . The evaluation metrics are Mean Average Precision ( MAP ) and Normalized Discount Cumulative Gain ( NDCG ) [ 3 ] . For comparison purpose , three baseline strategies are involved to compare with our proposed algorithm . The first is a learningbased meta search method , called ProFusion [ 2 ] algorithm . The second baseline is Random Blended which merges the top results from different SEs randomly . We also use generic Web search we crawled from the commercial search engine we used as the baseline . The results are shown in table 2 . PM stands for our proposed approach and RB is the random results . Table 2 verifies the significant improvement of our proposed approach . Table 2 .

5 . CONCLUSION Vertical search engines ( VSEs ) have attracted much attention in the past decade . However , they are not very popular yet . This motivates the commercial search engines to blend vertical search results into generic Web search . In this abstract , we first study the vertical search engines’ query log of a commercial search engine to show the importance of blended search problem . And then we propose a probabilistic model based approach to explore the blended search problem . Finally we experimentally verify that our proposed algorithm can effectively blend vertical search results into generic Web search .

3 . TYPESET TEXT In this paper , search engines ( SEs ) is noted as both VSEs and general purpose search engine . Let Λ = {Si , i=1,2,…m} stands for the set of all SEs . Given the user query q , the search results are represented by R ={Rij , i=1,2,…m and j=1,2,…n} , where Rij is the jth search result of query q in the ith search engines Si . Our problem is to rank the results come from various SEs for generic Web search . Thus we aim to learn the probability p(Rij|q ) and then the search results of q can be ranked according to the probabilities in a decreasing order . To learn p(Rij|q ) , we firstly analyze the dependencies between queries , SEs and search results . Since Rij is retrieved from Si by query q , it depends on both Si and q . On the i≠ . other hand , we assume that Rij is independent of Vl if l Intuitively , we assume that each result can only be retrieved from one search engine . Note the fact that different queries will have different vertical search intentions . The importance of SEs is not uniformly distributed . It will highly depend on the user query . Motivated by these clear dependencies , we modeled our problem , ie the problem of learning probability p(Rij|q ) , by a probabilistic graphical model , which is described by Figure 1 .
