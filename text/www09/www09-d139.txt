ABSTRACT Searching posts effectively has become an important issue in large scale online communities . Especially , if search users have different inclinations when they search posts , they have different kinds of posts in their minds . To address this problem , in this paper , we propose a scheme of ranking posts based on search users’ inclination . User ranking score is employed to capture posts that are relevant to a specific user inclination . Specifically , we present a scheme to rank posts in terms of user expertise and popularity . Experimental results show that different user inclinations can produce quite different search results and the proposed scheme achieves about 70 % accuracy .

Introduction Online communities on the web are so popular that large scale ones like YouTube often contain up to millions of posts created by community users . Thus , searching posts effectively has become an important issue . Especially , if search users have different inclinations when they search posts , they have different kinds of posts in their minds . For example , popular posts must be ranked high when search users look for popular contents , meanwhile high quality posts should be ranked high when they want contents of high expertise . In this paper , we propose a scheme of ranking posts based on search users’ inclination . 2 . User Inclination based Post Ranking A post ’s score is computed by the combination of semantic similarity score and user inclination based score as follows :
PostScore(cid:4666)(cid:1869)(cid:1857)(cid:1877),(cid:1868)(cid:1867)(cid:4667)α(cid:1499)SemanticSimilarity(cid:4666)(cid:1869)(cid:1857)(cid:1877),(cid:1868)(cid:1867)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:3397)(cid:4666)1α(cid:4667)(cid:1499)UserInclinationPostScore(cid:4666)(cid:1868)(cid:1867)(cid:4667 ) , ( cid:4666)0α1(cid:4667 ) UserInclinationPostScore(cid:4666)p(cid:4667 ) ( cid:3533)UserRankingScore(cid:4666)u(cid:4667 )
The semantic similarity score of a post against a search query is computed by a TF*IDF based document weighting scheme . The user inclination based score of a post is obtained by the summation of the ranking scores of the users who have given any contribution to the content :
( cid:2931)(cid:1488)U(cid:3174 )
, where Up consists of the users that have contributed to the post , p . Here , contribution means post related user activities such as

The method to compute user ranking scores should be dependent on the specific user inclinations . In this paper , we introduce two user inclinations : expertise and popularity . Figure 1 represents the framework of the scheme . In off line step , user ranking scores[1 ] on specific user inclinations are computed a priori , which is followed by user score transform process . When a user query comes in , user inclination based post scores are combined with semantic similarity scores to produce the rank results .
Figure 1 . Framework of User Inclination based Post Ranking 3 . User Expertise and Popularity User created contents like photos or videos can be measured in two contrary aspects : expertise and popularity . While some users want to see popular photos that many other users have seen , others may want to see photos that are regarded to have high expertise . In this paper , we present a scheme to model these two aspects as the comparative user inclinations . If a post contains high quality or expert level contents , the post is likely to receive more responses from expert users than from non expert users . In contrast , if a post contains low quality or novice level contents , expert users may not respond the post at all . It can be said that the expertise of a post can be determined by the expertise of the commentators for the post . In other words , the commentators’ expertise can affect the expertise of the poster . From this inference , we design the user expertise feature : Expertise Reference(ER ) . The ER of a user u is affected by the ER values of all the users v who have commented on the posts written by the user u .
Let |A(cid:2931)| be the number of posts written by the user u and |C(cid:2932)| be the number of comments written by the user v , and |CA(cid:3179),(cid:2932)| be the number of comments written by the user v for the posts Au , which is written by the user u . Then , the expertise reference , ER(u ) of the user u is formulated as follows :

, where ∑ |(cid:1829)(cid:3002)(cid:3296),||(cid:1829)|
Meanwhile , popularity could be thought as the opposite concept of expertise . However , some posts with high expertise can be also popular . Popularity had better be translated as the extent of inclinations that normal users like . To reflect this stream , we obtain the popularity scores of users by applying transform function such as normal distribution for user ranks in accordance with the user expertise scores explained above . 4 . User Ranking Score Transform Each user ’s score obtained from user ranking on a specific user inclination criterion can be additionally tailored by user score transform functions to meet different user inclination criteria . For example , given user ranking of expertise , if a search user wants to see low browed but popular contents , a transform function will effect to make comparatively high user scores into lower ones and low scores into higher ones . In some cases , the transformation from user scores into user ranks may be required . Furthermore , user ranks can be passed into probability density functions to produce biased user scores . For example , normal distribution and exponential distribution can give more weight to average ranked users and high ranked users , respectively . 5 . Experimental Results We conduct the experiments with the data sets from a large scale web community called “ SLR Club ( http://wwwslrclubcom ) ” in which users can post photos and also give comments on other users’ photos . The data set contains 129,941 posts and 1,191,716 comments by 114,308 users for about one and half years . In ranking posts in term of expertise , we use the combination of ER and identity transform . As for popularity , we combine ER and normal distribution probability density transform on ER ranks . Figure 2 demonstrates some high ranked photos on expertise and popularity searched by the proposed scheme . In each figure 2 (a ) and 2 (b ) , upper four pictures are results of no search keyword , and lower four are results of search keyword “ sea ” . Photos of expertise appear to be quite relevant to high level skills on photography ; meanwhile , popular photos seem to be related to interestingness of stuff such as young woman , unusual situation , rare animals , and so on .

Figure 2 . Retrieved Photos with the highest expertise and with the highest popularity . We analyze the correlation between expertise and popularity of posts . As can be seen in figure 3 (a ) , the correlation is minimal among high ranked expertise or popularity posts , and it gets higher in low ranked posts . The x axis represents the post ranks in order of expertise and y axis represents popularity ranks .

Figure 3 (b ) also shows the trend that the correlation fluctuation gets larger as the post rank increases . Finally , to evaluate the performance of judgment on expertise and popularity of the proposed scheme , we let four persons to judge 253 photos whether each photo has more expertise or more popularity . By the proposed scheme , among the 253 pictures , 128 pictures are categorized as high expertise ones , and 125 pictures as high popularity ones . Table 2 summarizes the user study results . As for precision , photos within the popularity category get higher score ( 71.2% ) , meanwhile photos within the expertise category get higher score ( 69.2 % ) in recall . The overall F1 score is about 66%~68 % . The demonstration is available at our web site[2 ] .

Conclusions In this paper , we presented a scheme to effectively find usercreated contents based on search users’ inclinations in largescale online communities . Experimental results showed that user inclination is very influential in ranking posts diversely . Also , we proposed that user inclinations could be captured by user ranking mechanism . As a case study , we presented user expertise and popularity . It should be noted that our approach of using user inclination in searching online community contents is different from the user profile based personalized web search approaches like the recent publication[3 ] . Future work includes further investigation on possible user inclinations . 7 .
