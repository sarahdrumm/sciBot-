ABSTRACT Nowadays , information is primarily searched on the WWW . From a user perspective , the readability is an important criterion for measuring the accessibility and thereby the quality of an information . We show that modern content extraction algorithms help to estimate the readability of a web document quite accurate .

INTRODUCTION
The WWW is a major resource for finding information . The problem is to find relevant information and to understand this information . Therefore a user has to first find an appropriate document and then identify , read and understand its content to satisfy his need for information .
Readability is commonly evaluated by using readability indices , such as SMOG [ 6 ] or FRE [ 2 ] . In a web environment , these indices are calculated on full web documents , eg in [ 5 ] . Hence , they consider navigation menus , layout elements , related links lists , copyright information , etc . in their evaluation . These elements typically do not consist of well formed language and distort the values of the readability indices . This might result in misleading values , especially , because users usually focus on the main article in a document and ignore all other parts . Accordingly , a readability analysis should be restricted to those parts the user actually reads , ie the main content of a document .
In this paper we will investigate the combination of content extraction and readability tests . Section 2 describes two readability indices , section 3 presents content extraction and in section 4 we combine the both concepts .
2 . READABILITY INDICES
A readability index is a mean to express the complexity of written text . Based on simple features , such as sentence and word length , they indicate how easy it is to read and comprehend a text . Originally developed for text documents , they are nowadays applied to web documents , too [ 5 , 4 ] . 2.1 Flesch Reading Ease
One index to determine readability is the Flesch Reading Ease ( FRE ) [ 2 ] . It has a score between 0 and 100 . A higher Copyright is held by the author/owner(s ) . WWW2009 , April 20 24 , 2009 , Madrid , Spain . .

A score lower than 30 implies a college graduate . If y is the total number of syllables , w the number of words and s the number of sentences in the text , FRE is defined as : rFRE = 206.835 − 84.6 y w
− 1.015 w s
2.2 SMOG
McLaughlin [ 6 ] presented a different readability formula , the SMOG grading . This index indicates the educational level , ie the years of school education , required to understand a text . If p is the number of polysyllables ( words with three or more syllables ) and s again the number of sentences , SMOG is defined as : r p s rSMOG = 1.043
+ 3.1291
3 . CONTENT EXTRACTION
Content Extraction ( CE ) is the process of determining those parts of an HTML document which represent its main textual content . 3.1 Document Slope Curves
Pinto et al .
[ 7 ] developed the Document Slope Curves ( DSC ) algorithm as an extension of the Body Text Extraction ( BTE ) by Finn et al . [ 1 ] . While BTE identifies a continuous part of a document which contains most of the text while excluding most of the tags , DSC uses a windowing technique to locate also distributed and interrupted parts of the document , which satisfy the same characteristics . 3.2 Adapted Content Code Blurring
The idea of content code blurring ( CCB ) [ 3 ] is to take advantage of typical visual features of the main and the additional contents . Additional contents are usually highly formatted and contain little and short texts , while the main text content is commonly long and homogeneously formatted . CCB identifies these homogeneously formatted regions in HTML documents by calculating local content code ratios on a character level . Adapted CCB ( ACCB ) additionally ignores anchor tags in this process , which yields better results .
4 . ESTIMATING READABILITY
As mentioned initially , readability indices for web documents should focus in the main content . Hence , our idea is

For this purpose , we analysed a total of 1114 documents from five different web sites for which we manually outlined the main content . We then compared the readability indices computed on the actual main article with those computed on the full document and those based on a document version in which the main content was extracted via the ACCB or the DSC algorithm . The results for the SMOG index are listed in table 1 . The figures show , that both CE approaches estimate the readability indices for the main article far more accurate than an index calculated on the full document .
We will now take a more detailed look at the first 100 pages of the Yahoo news data . Figure 1 and 2 show a plot of the readability scores using the FRE and SMOG index . In both cases the readability estimates involving CE correlate very well with the index of the hand extracted main content . e r o c s E R F

Finally , figure 3 shows the difference between the SMOG score of the actual main article and the three estimates . In the case of Yahoo the average difference between the score of ACCB and the actual main content is 0.185 , for DSC it is 0.179 while the difference to the full document is 0704 i e c n e r e ff d G O M S

5 . CONCLUSIONS
The paper demonstrates the improvements in estimating readability of web documents when applying content extraction algorithms prior to index calculation . We observed the SMOG and the FRE index to be far more accurate in combination with CE in comparison to calculating them on the full document . Further investigations need to be done to find the most suitable CE algorithm for a downstream readability analysis .
