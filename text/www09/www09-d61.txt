ABSTRACT Due to the lexical gap between questions and answers , automatically detecting right answers becomes very challenging for community question answering sites . In this paper , we propose an analogical reasoning based method . It treats questions and answers as relational data and ranks an answer by measuring the analogy of its link to a query with the links embedded in previous relevant knowledge ; the answer that links in the most analogous way to the new question is assumed to be the best answer . We based our experiments on 29.8 million Yahoo!Answer questionanswer threads and showed the effectiveness of the approach .

1 . INTRODUCTION As one type of portals for fast growing user generated content ( UGC ) , community question answering ( CQA ) sites have attracted a large number of users both seeking and providing answers to a variety of questions on a variety of subjects . Since they allow anyone to post or answer any questions on any subjects , the quality of answers varies greatly . Thus , the ability to automatically identify the best answers has significant impact on users’ satisfaction .
The major challenge of identifying high quality answers in CQA sites is the lexical gap between a question and its correct answer . The gap is caused by at least two factors : 1 ) textual mismatch between questions and answers . Words appeared in a question will not necessarily reappear in its best answer ; and 2 ) user generated spam or flippant answers .
Previous work solved this problem by either generating complementary features provided by highly structured CQA sites [ 1 ] , or finding textual clues using machine learning techniques [ 3 ] . In this paper , we propose an analogical reasoning based ranking technique which uses previous relevant knowledge to bridge the lexical gap , and discovers non textual clues between questions and their answers to identify the correct ones . In particular , we assume that a question has implicit positive links with its right answers , and negative linkages with other answers . Given a new question , firstly we retrieve a set of positively linked ( ie correctly answered ) question answer pairs ( q a pairs ) whose questions

The retrieved q a pairs construct a supporting set . Secondly , we predict the analogy of the link between the new question and each of its candidate answers to the links in the supporting set . The analogy is predicted by a logistic regression model learnt offline . The answer which has the most analogous linkage is assumed to be the best answer to the new question .
There are two key aspects of the proposed idea : 1 ) Instead of either separating questions and their answers as independent information sources or mixing them as one object , we treat them as relational data and predict the property of the link . Secondly , instead of directly predict the link with the link prediction model , we use a supporting set to bridge the lexical gap and facilitate the prediction . Intuitively , not only the supporting set is more likely to share terms with the candidate answers , but also it provides the knowledge of how similar questions are answered , while the “ way of answering ” suggests the desired answers .
2 . THE APPROACH 2.1 Learning the Link Prediction Model We adopt the Bayesian Analogical Reasoning ( BAR ) framework proposed by Silva et al . [ 3 ] to predict the latent q a linkages . Formally , let 𝑋𝑖𝑗 = [ Φ1 𝑄𝑖 , 𝐴𝑗 , Φ2 𝑄𝑖 , 𝐴𝑗 , … , ΦK 𝑄𝑖 , 𝐴𝑗 ] be a 𝐾 dimensional feature vector of the q a pair of question 𝑄𝑖 and answer 𝐴𝑗 , where Φ defines the mapping Φ : 𝒬 × 𝒜 → ℛK . Let 𝐶𝑖𝑗 ∈ {0,1} be an indicator of the type of the link between 𝑄𝑖 and 𝐴𝑗 , where 𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 1 indicates a positive linkage and 𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 0 otherwise . Let Θ = [ 𝜃1 , 𝜃2 , … , 𝜃𝐾 ] be the parameter vector of the logistic regression model to be learnt , we have
𝑃 𝐶𝑖𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑖𝑗 , Θ =
1
1 + exp(Θ𝑇𝑋𝑖𝑗 )
( 1 ) where 𝑋𝑖𝑗 ∈ 𝑋𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 = {𝑋𝑖𝑗 , 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝐷𝑞 , 1 ≤ 𝑗 ≤ 𝐷𝑎 } is a training q a pair and 𝐷𝑞 , 𝐷𝑎 are the numbers of training questions and answers respectively . Generally we have 𝐷𝑎 ≫ 𝐷𝑞 .
We use both positive q a pairs ( ie good answer ) and negative q a pairs ( ie noisy answers ) to train this model , while the effect of negative ones is embedded in a Gaussian prior .
To ensure the preciseness of the prior , firstly we fit a BAR model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation ( MLE ) on the training data , and obtain an initial Θ . Then we compute the covariance matrix Σ as a smoothed version of the MLE estimated covariance :
−1
Σ
=
𝑐 𝑁
⋅ ( 𝑿𝑻𝑾 𝑿 )
( 2 ) where 𝑐 is a predefined number , 𝑁 is the size of the training dataset , 𝑿 is the 𝑁 × 𝐾 feature matrix of the training q a pairs , either positive or negative . 𝑾 is a diagonal matrix with 𝑾 𝒊𝒊 = 𝑝 𝑖 ⋅ ( 1 − 𝑝 𝑖 ) , and 𝑝 𝑖 is the predicted probability of a positive link for the 𝑖th row of 𝑿 . The prior of Θ is then the Gaussian 𝒩(Θ , Σ ) .
We randomly sample a similar number of negative points as a positive population to balance the number of positive and negative training data .
2.2 Retrieving Relevant Previous Knowledge In the testing stage , given a new q a thread , we retrieve some relevant positive q a pairs from 29.8 million q a threads crawled from the Yahoo!Answers site .
We adopt traditional information retrieval techniques to find the supporting q a set . In particular , let 𝑄𝑞 be a query question and its 𝑖 , 1 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑀} , we retrieve those positive q a answer list be {𝐴𝑞 pairs 𝑺 = {𝑄1 : 𝐴1 , 𝑄2 : 𝐴2 , … , 𝑄𝐿 : 𝐴𝐿} with high cosine similarity above a threshold :
𝑺 = {𝑄𝑖 : 𝐴𝑖| cos 𝑄𝑞 , 𝑄𝑖 > 𝜆 , 𝑖 ∈ 1 , … , 𝐷 }
( 3 ) where 𝐷 is the size of the crawled Yahoo!Answers database and 𝜆 is a threshold . Each question is represented in the bag of word model . The effect of 𝜆 is shown in Figure 2 .

2.3 Answer Ranking by Analogical Reasoning 𝑀 Given 𝑺 , we score the new q a pairs 𝑄𝑞 : 𝐴𝑞 with Eq ( 4 ) by measuring a marginal :
2 , … , 𝑄𝑞 : 𝐴𝑞
1 , 𝑄𝑞 : 𝐴𝑞
𝑠𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 𝑄𝑞 , 𝐴𝑞
𝑗 = 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃 𝐶𝑞
𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑞
𝑗 , 𝑺 , 𝑪𝑺 = 1
− 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃 𝐶𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑞
𝑗
( 4 )
𝑗 is the 𝑗 th answer of the query question . 𝑋𝑞
𝑗 where 𝐴𝑞 represents 𝑗 ) . 𝑪𝑺 is the vector of link indicators for 𝑺 , the features of ( 𝑄𝑞 , 𝐴𝑞 and 𝑪𝑺 = 1 indicates that all the q a pairs in 𝑺 have positive links , ie {𝐶1 = 1 , 𝐶2 = 1 , … , 𝐶𝐿 = 1} .
𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑞
𝑗 , 𝑺 , 𝑪𝑺 = 1 , measThe first term in Eq ( 4 ) , ie 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃 𝐶𝑞 ures the probability of a positive query linkage when the support𝑗 , on the ing set is observed . The second term , 𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑃 𝐶𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑞 other hand , evaluates this probability in the case that only the query q a pair is observed . The idea underlying Eq ( 4 ) is actually 𝑗 ) would “ fit into ” 𝑺 , or to what to measure to what extent ( 𝑄𝑞 , 𝐴𝑞 𝑗 ) . The more analogous it is to the supextent 𝑺 explains ( 𝑄𝑞 , 𝐴𝑞 porting linked q a pairs , the higher score a q a pair obtains .
We use the learnt logistic regression model to predict the probability of a positive linkage in particular , which gives Eq ( 5 ) and Eq ( 6 ) :
𝑃 𝐶𝑞
𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑞
𝑗 , 𝑺 , 𝑪𝑺 = 1 =
𝑃 𝐶𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑞
𝑗 , Θ 𝑃(Θ| 𝑺 , 𝑪𝑺 = 1)𝑑Θ
𝑃 𝐶𝑞
𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑞
𝑗 = 𝑃 𝐶𝑗 = 1 𝑋𝑞
𝑗 , Θ 𝑃(Θ)𝑑Θ

3 . EVALUATION We crawled 29.8 million questions from the Yahoo!Answers website , all of which have user labeled “ best answers ” . 100,000 randomly selected q a pairs were used to train the link prediction model , and 16,000 q a threads were used for testing ; each contains 12.35 answers on average , which results in about 200,000 testing q a pairs .
We compared our approach with three baseline methods : Nearest Neighbor ( NN ) , Cosine distance and Bsets [ 2 ] . The first two directly measure the similarity between a question and an answer ,

4 . CONCLUSION This paper has presented a novel best answer identification method for CQA sites . It not only uses a supporting set to bridge the lexical gap between questions and answers , but also treats them as relational data and learns an analogical reasoning based model to rank the answers of a new question . The best answer is identified as the top ranked one which has the strongest analogy to the positive links in the supporting set . Experiments based on 29.8 million real q a threads showed the effectiveness of the proposed method .
