Since 1970s , many software reliability growth models ( SRGMs ) have been proposed for the reliability estimation of software products during software development processes [ 2 ] . However , application of SRGMs has shown that there is commonly great disagreement in software reliability predictions , while none of them can be trusted to provide consistently accurate results across different applications . Consequently , it is hard for managers to select an adequate model to predict software reliability for their developed software . Therefore , some researches suggested that engineers can use combined SRGMs to obtain more accurate software reliability prediction during testing [ 2 , 3 ] .
Actually , the development of web based software is very different from the non web commercial off the shelf ( COTS ) software . Web based applications have the characteristics of cross platform support , massive user population , data security requirement , and complicated network environment . In recent years , Tian et al . [ 6 ] tried to evaluate software reliability based on web workload and failure data . Tsai et al . [ 7 ] also proposed a service oriented software that dynamically evaluates the reliability of web services . In this paper , we will propose three simple and workable combinational models by combining different SRGMs to measure software reliability for web based software , and study how to integrate genetic algorithm ( GA ) for the related weight assignments . Finally , results from applications to a real failure data obtained from web based ERP system are presented . reliability model

2 . PROPOSED MODELS 2.1 Weighted Combinations
In general , SRGMs depend on failure data to estimate failure pattern and reflect different testing conditions [ 2 ] . Sometimes , SRGMs may result in prediction bias from the collected data . One common way to eliminate this bias is suggested by averaging or combining the estimated results of models [ 1 , 3 ] . On the other hand , software development processes involve many intricate human activities and environmental factors the applicability of SRGMs . Hence , different SRGMs have different underlying assumptions which are used to describe testing process , and they may have a certain relationship between SRGMs . However , because such relationship is unclear and still an open issue , here we formalize three weighted combinational models based on the calibration of arithmetic mean and geometric mean [ 1 ] , which respectively represent linear and nonlinear relationships between models . These weighted combinational models are equally weighted ( EW ) , linearly weighted ( LW ) and nonlinearly weighted ( NLW ) combinational models . that may influence
If the linear relationship exists in models , LW can be expressed as follows [ 3 ] :

1 where n is the number of models , Ei(t ) is the estimated result ( ie , cumulative number of faults ) of the ith model by time t , and wi is a stationary weight given to the ith model . LW is relevant to the arithmetic summation of estimated results with weights [ 1 ] . In the simplest combination , an equal weight could be assigned to each model for deriving a final prediction .
Similarly , if the relationship between models is nonlinear ,
NLW can be defined as follows : n ∏
)(ˆ tE
= n tE )( i w i
, n i =∑ nw i

The identity of NLW is based on the nth root of the geometric product of estimated results with exponential weights [ 1 ] . Clearly , if we take a logarithm on Eq ( 2 ) , it is given as log(

We can see that NLW will become a special case of LW . Likewise , when wi are all equal to 1 in Eq ( 2 ) or Eq ( 3 ) , NLW can have an equal weight .
SRGMs could be divided into several types based on their reliability growth curves [ 2 ] . In this paper , some SRGMs , such as the Goel Okumoto ( GO ) , the delayed S shaped ( DeS ) , the inflected S shaped ( InfS ) , and the generalized Goel Okumoto ( GGO ) models , are considered as the candidate models for our proposed weighted combinations . It is noted that the parameters of these candidate models will be estimated by applying Maximum Likelihood Estimation ( MLE ) in advance [ 2 ] .

From Eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) , it appears an annoying problem in terms of determining appropriate weight for each model . Fundamentally , this problem can be treated as a searching problem . Here we suggest the use of GA to conduct weight assignment . GA is a kind of evolutionary algorithms that uses bit level computations for finding approximate solutions [ 4 ] . Its searching process includes several steps : chromosome representation , selection scheme , crossover operator , and mutation operator . This searching process will run these steps iteratively and evolve solutions until a best weight assignment is found or termination condition is reached . The evaluation of this searching process is determined by the value of fitness function [ 4 ] . Fitness function is an indicator of the fitness of every chromosome that shows how close this chromosome is to the desired solution . We can define the fitness function as follows :
−= fitness
, ( 4 ) where log(ML ) is the logarithm of maximum likelihood function ( LML ) [ 3 ] . Our goal is to maximize the fitness function for finding the best weighted assignment of our proposed models . 3 . PRELIMINARY RESULTS
A real failure data based on a web based ERP system ( WebERP ) [ 5 ] is used for illustration . This system was written by PHP language with about 220K lines of code . Over the course of 60 months ( from Aug . 2003 to Jul . 2008 ) , 146 failures were detected . Related parametric settings for GA are given as below : population size = 100 chromosomes , crossover rate = 0.6 , and mutation rate = 0.2 [ 4 ] .
To validate the proposed models with EW and traditional SRGMs , three criteria , named LML ( see Eq ( 4) ) , Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) [ 2 ] , and relative error ( RE ) curve [ 2 ] , are used for model comparisons . Results of parameter estimation of all selected models and related weight assignments are given in Table 1 . Comparison results for all models and the plot of RE curves are presented in Table 2 and Figure 1 , respectively . log(

The shadow indicates the most accurate result in the LML or AIC criterion ; The bold indicates the least accurate result in the LML or AIC criterion .
From Table 1 , it is noted that LW has two weights for DeS and InfS , and NLW also has two weights for InfS and GGO . According to the classification of SRGMs , DeS and InfS are S shaped models , and GGO could approach S shaped model as c > 1 [ 2 ] . On the other hand , from Table 1 , we have φ = 2001 That is , the inflection rate ( ie , ratio of the number of detectable faults to the total number of faults in the program ) is 0.333 , indicating the growth curve of this data is S shaped . This corresponds with the finding provided by LW and NLW , ie , wGO=0 .
From Table 2 , it is worth noting that LW and NLW give better fit for this dataset . Besides , LW and NLW are more accurate than EW in both LML and AIC criteria . Figure 1 also depicts that the LW and NLW still give a better fit to the observed data in most data points , and also predict the future behavior well in the tail area . On the other hand , since software reliability is related to the cumulative number of faults , we can easily use the estimated results of proposed LW and NLW models to compute software reliability . Let conditional reliability be R(Δt|t ) , which is defined as the probability that a software will be successful in the time interval ( t , t +Δt ] [ 2 ] . If we choose LW and ΔT = 0.01 ( month ) as an example , then we have R = 0972 During testing , this information would be very useful and important for project manager ( PM ) to determine the total amount of software testing time , resource allocation , and quality improvement , etc .
Finally , from above experiments and discussions , if PM plans to employ SRGM for estimation of reliability growth of products , engineers should select some SRGMs , and apply them in parallel . Although SRGMs sometimes give good results , there is no single model that can be trusted to give accurate results in all circumstances . In this case , we can conclude that the proposed weighted combinational models may be a good approach to provide a more accurate prediction of software reliability for web based software than using SRGMs or EW . r o r r E e v i t a l e R
