ABSTRACT A soft error redirection is a URL redirection to a page that returns the HTTP status code 200 ( OK ) but has actually no relevant content to the client request . Since such redirections degrade the performance of web search engines in many ways , it is highly desirable to remove as many of them as possible . We propose a novel approach to detect soft error redirections by analyzing redirection logs collected during crawling operation . Experimental results on huge crawl data show that our measure can classify soft error redirections effectively .

INTRODUCTION
Behind the rapid proliferation , the web exhibits rapid decay as well . Recent studies have reported that a large fraction of the Web consists of dead pages , and especially , more than 25 % of the dead links are involved in the ( in)famous soft error redirections [ 2 ] .
Soft error redirections occur in many ways . Many web servers today redirect the requested – but permanently or temporarily inaccessible – URL to a dedicated page informing a certain error such as 403 ( forbidden ) , 404 ( not found ) , or 5xx ( server error ) , with the status code 200 ( OK ) . Sometimes , miscofiguration causes inadvertent redirections to the site ’s root page .
Another important type of soft error is a redirection spam . Redirection methods have historically been abused by spammers in many ways . For example , when a domain name is allowed to lapse , a spammer often re registers it and puts a redirect from this site into his own web site , in order to profit from the prior promotional works of the previous owners of the “ parked ” site [ 2 ] . Sometimes , a spammer generates enormous keyword stuffed URLs and redirects them to the target page . We regard these types of redirections as soft errors in a broad sense . ∗ Supported by Korea Research Council of Fundamental Science and Technology .

The soft error redirection seriously disturbs not only the web surfer ’s experience , but also the search engine ’s performance in many aspects . In crawling , for example , it leads to crawl a bunch of pages which are not related with the requested URLs , but whose contents are nearly identical . In indexing , these irrelevant and near duplicate pages waste computation time and disk space . In ranking , they adversely affect link based ranking to result in disproportionate promotion to undeserving pages . Then , in presentation , they distort displayed search results and lead to a poor user experience . Thus , for search engines , it is crucial to find out such unnecessary redirections in as early a stage as possible . However , to the best of our knowledge , there have been few attempts to tackle this problem in the literature . BarYossef et al . [ 2 ] developed a heuristic for detecting soft 404 s , in which they induce a 404 error by fetching a URL with a random file name , and find out that the target server generates a soft error redirection to a certain page ( soft 404 ) . Their heuristic effectively finds soft 404 pages , but it does not cover soft errors related with other types of errors such as 403 , or 5xx . Moreover , the assumption that roots of web sites are never redirected to soft 404 pages prohibits finding the soft errors related with redirection spams .
We propose a novel measure to detect soft error redirections by analyzing redirection logs collected during crawling operation . Since we only use the redirection logs , we neither require predefined white/black lists nor fetch actual web pages for the whole process . The results demonstrate that we can effectively identify not only soft 404 , but also 403 , and 5xx . Moreover , the proposed measure also catches redirection spams in the type of soft errors .
2 . HEURISTICS AND SCORING MEASURE Let u be the URL1 of a page and host(u ) be the hostname of u , eg , for u = http://wwwfoocom/bar , host(u ) is wwwfoocom Suppose we have a large collection U of original URLs along with V of target URLs , and a function f : U → V , where a redirection2 from u ∈ U to v ∈ V is denoted by v = f ( u ) . We are to find soft error redirections ( u , f ( u ) ) from a redirection log L ⊂ U × V , where L is a set of redirection pairs {(u , f ( u ) ) : u ∈ U} collected by a crawler .
Our first observation is that if a host has a dedicated page v for soft error redirection ( and this appears to be common ) , we can expect to find multiple occurrences of v as 1
We assume that all input URLs are properly parsed and nor malized according to the URI syntax defined in RFC 3986 . 2

For example , we observed prevalence of redirections to http://errdocgabia net/404.html , which is a soft 404 page in one of the largest Korean web hosting sites . This simple observation gives the following heuristic . For a target URL v ∈ V , let Iv be the number of redirections in L whose target URL is v . H1 . A soft error redirection ( u , v ) is likely to have a large Iv .
Unfortunately , there are many redirections that have large Iv albeit they are not related with soft errors . For example , legitimate redirections to a site ’s root page v may have a large Iv due to soft error redirections to v , as well as legitimate redirections . We observed many instances that a reputable URL such as http://wwwgooglecom is redirected not only from legitimate URLs such as http://google.com , but also from a lot of irrelevant URLs such as http:// buyonlinedrugsmorecom Thus , a decision solely based on H1 may filter out relevant redirections too . We address the challenge of distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant redirections sharing the same target URL by using the following two characteristics of original URL ’s host .
Since hosts generating a number of soft errors usually tend to redirect many URLs into a few target URLs , we characterize these hosts by means of convergence of redirections . For a host h , let Nh be the number of original URLs in h and Mh be the number of target URLs redirected from URLs in h . Then , Nh/Mh , the average number of original URLs in h sharing the same redirection target , represents the amount of converging redirections in h . The following heuristic employs this characteristic . H2 . A redirection from a host h with large Nh/Mh is likely to be a soft error redirection .
On the other hand , legitimate advertising servers or portals’ directory servers typically generate a large number of redirections whose target hosts are distinct . Using this characteristic , we can prevent their redirections from being misclassified as soft errors by H1 . We define Hh as the number of distinct target hosts reached by redirections from a host h , ie Hh = |{host(y ) : ( x , y ) ∈ L , st host(x ) = h}| . H3 . A legitimate redirection server h is likely to have a large Hh . µ as follows . For each redirection ( u , v ) ∈ L , we define
Based on the above heuristics , we design a scoring measure
µ(u , v ) . k1 log10 Iv + k2 log10
Nhost(u ) Mhost(u )
+ k3 log10

Hhost(u ) where k1 , k2 , and k3 are nonnegative weight constants . This measure gives higher scores to soft error redirections .
3 . EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
All the experimental data used for validation were collected by WisponBot [ 1 ] . Here , we only show results on the log with 13 , 549 , 460 redirections from 3.2 billion Korean web pages crawled in June , 2008 . We remark that experimental results for other sets of crawl data with different sizes and timestamps show similar trends .
We say that a redirection is a highly suspected soft error , if any of distinct patterns suggesting soft errors , such as “ 404 ” , “ 503 ” , “ error ” , etc . , are found in the target URL , but not in the original URL . We first estimate classification n o i t r o p o r p e v i t l a u m u C

Figure 2 : ROC Curve with the AUC=0.95 performance of our scoring measure by observing the reverse cumulative distribution of highly suspected soft error redirections across the score . Fig 1 shows clear distinction between highly suspected soft error redirections and the entire redirections in the log ( ALL ) . For example , if we set 3 as the cut off threshold value , we can find almost 80 % of soft errors having “ 404 ” , “ 503 ” , and “ error ” in the target URL . On the other hand , legitimate redirections from a directory server such as Yahoo directory or empas.com ( a Korean portal ) have a different shape of curve , which shows that almost all redirections have scores below 0 .
Fig 2 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve derived from manual inspection on randomly sampled 1,000 redirections . The area under the ROC curve has 0.95 , which indicate a high accuracy . The cut off threshold of 3 gives us precision of 0.866 , recall of 0.736 and false positive rate of 0039 Table 1 below shows composition of correctly classified soft errors with this threshold . We can effectively identify soft error redirections to sites’ root page ( “ Root ” in the table ) , soft 5xx and 403 as well as soft 404s . Note that 60.7 % of redirection spams are also caught by our measure .
