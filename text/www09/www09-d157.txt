INTRODUCTION
Social tagging ( aka folksonomy ) is popular in Web 2.0 applications , such as Delicious , CiteULike , Last.fm , Flickr and YouTube .
In this paper , we study the recurrence dynamics of social tagging , ie , how tags recur in folksonomies . Specifically , we try to answer the following questions . How often do tags recur ? How hard is predicting tag recurrence ? What tags are likely to recur ?
These questions are crucial to understanding and improving social tagging . Although there exists some investigation on the dynamics of tag co occurrence [ 1 ] , the dynamics of tag recurrence is not well studied .
2 . DATA
We model the social tagging data as a time ordered series of posts . Each post is described by a tuple ( user , item , tagset , time ) which means the user annotated the item with the tags in tag set at the time . Here we assume the system time is represented as an integer which is incremented by one on each post .

We use the RSDC08 dataset1 from the ECML/PKDD2008 Discovery Challenge . It is provided by Bibsonomy2 , a Web 2.0 service for bookmarking and sharing bibliographic references . The dataset , after cleaning , consists of 152 , 171 posts from 2 , 475 users .
3 . ANALYSIS
We consider two settings of tag recurrence : ( i ) individual : a tag in the given post from user u is regarded as a recurrence if it has been used by u herself before ; ( ii ) collective : a tag in the given post from user u is regarded as a recurrence if it has been used by any user ( either u herself or another user ) before .
3.1 How often do tags recur ?
Figure 1 shows the growth of tag recurrence number . In both individual and collective settings , the tag recurrence number increases at a fairly steady rate . On average , among the 3.7 tags used per post , 2.8 of them are individual recurrences and 3.4 of them are collective recurrences . That is to say , about 75 % of tags have been used before individually and about 90 % of tags have been used before collectively .

3.2 How hard is predicting tag recurrence ?
We use the entropy of tags in the tagging history to characterize the uncertainty about tag recurrence : the larger the entropy , the harder it is to predict the next tag to be 1http://wwwkdecsuni kasselde/ws/rsdc08/ 2http://wwwbibsonomyorg/

In the individual setting , we calculate the conditional tag entropy given the user as H(tag|user ) = H(tag , user ) − H(user ) .
Figure 2 shows the entropy of tags over time . Although the tag vocabulary grows with a nearly constant speed ( 0.3 new tags per post ) , the collective entropy increases very slowly to 12 bits , while the individual entropy remains almost stable at less than 8 bits . The collective entropy of 12 bits corresponds to a perplexity of 4,096 tags , far less than the number of ( distinctive ) tags . The individual entropy of 8 bits corresponds to a perplexity of 256 tags , which implies that personalisation has the potential to reduce the tag search space by more than 16 times .

3.3 What tags are likely to recur ?
Figure 3 shows two log log plots of tag recurrence number versus tag frequency rank and tag recency rank respectively . We see that ( 1 ) more frequently used tags are more likely to recur ; and ( 2 ) more recently used tags are more likely to recur . These observations are consistent with our intuition . Moreover , the nearly straight lines in the above log log plots suggest that the relationship between tag recurrence number n and frequency or recency rank r roughly follows the power law : n ∝ 1/rα , where the scaling exponent α is around 0.5 on tag frequency and around 1.0 on tag recency .
4 . CONCLUSIONS
Our findings provide useful insights about the develop ment of tag suggestion [ 2 , 3 ] techniques etc .
Making tag suggestions based on the tagging history is feasible , because most of the tags to be used have actually been used before . Since tags recur more in the collective tagging history than in the individual tagging history , collective tag suggestion should be able to achieve better recall than individual tag suggestion .
Making tag suggestions based on the tagging history can continue to be effective when more and more tags are added into the system , because the entropy of tags will stay relatively small . Since the entropy of tags is higher in the collective tagging history than in the individual tagging history , individual tag suggestion should be able to achieve better precision than collective tag suggestion .
More frequently or recently used tags should be favoured for tag suggestion , because they have higher probabilities to be reused . Since the power law distribution scalingexponents on tag recency are larger than those on tag frequency , tag recency is probably more useful than tag frequency for tag suggestion on our dataset . The strong correlation between tag recurrence and tag recency also suggests that a simple but up to date predictive model will probably work better than a comprehensive but out of date model for tag suggestion .
