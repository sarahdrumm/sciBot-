ABSTRACT Patent litigation not only covers legal and technical issues , it is also a key consideration for managers of high technology ( high tech ) companies when making strategic decisions . Patent litigation influences the market value of high tech companies . However , this raises unique challenges . To this end , in this paper , we develop a novel recommendation framework to solve the problem of litigation risk prediction . We will introduce a specific type of patent related litigation , that is , Section 337 investigations , which prohibit all acts of unfair competition , or any unfair trade practices , when exporting products to the United States . To build this recommendation framework , we collect and exploit a large amount of published information related to almost all Section 337 investigation cases . This study has two aims : ( 1 ) to predict the litigation risk in a specific industry category for hightech companies and ( 2 ) to predict the litigation risk from competitors for high tech companies . These aims can be achieved by mining historical investigation cases and related patents . Specifically , we propose two methods to meet the needs of both aims : a proximal slope one predictor and a time aware predictor . Several factors are considered in the proposed methods , including the litigation risk if a company wants to enter a new market and the risk that a potential competitor would file a lawsuit against the new entrant . Comparative experiments using real world data demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform several baselines with a significant margin .

INTRODUCTION
When an inventor , business , or other entity owns a patent and that patent is infringed , the patent owner has few alternatives other than to undertake patent litigation . Few entities wish to undertake patent litigation because it is usually lengthy and expensive . For example , Apple and Google spend more money on patent litigation and defensive patent acquisitions than they do on research and development . However , some firms try to extort money from others using patent litigation . These firms are known as patent trolls . Such firms collect patents solely for the purpose of litigation to extort money from small companies that cannot afford patent defense . In 2013 , the president of the United States , Barack Obama introduced a proposal to crack down on patent trolls . His administration also pledged to protect innovators from frivolous litigation . A country ’s government rarely talks explicitly about detailed aspects of technology and intellectual property policy . Thus , it is clear that patent litigation is a huge challenge for high technology ( high tech ) companies in the United States .

This paper focuses on a specific type of litigation : Section 337 investigations . Section 337 investigations refer to investigations conducted according to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 and its related amendments by the United States International Trade Commission ( USITC ) . Section 337 investigations prohibit all acts of unfair competition , or any unfair trade practices , when exporting products to the United States . If convicted under a Section 337 investigation , the exporter ’s products may be permanently excluded from the US market , which can result in considerable economic losses . Most Section 337 investigation cases concern patents . As with intellectual property rights , Section 337 investigations are frequently used for blocking purposes . Both parties in a Section 337 investigation are competitors ; hence such investigations can be a means of blocking competitors by preventing their market expansion . Therefore , predicting the probability of its involvement in a Section 337 investigation is crucial for the development of a high tech company .
Section 337 investigations consume precious resources , and the outcome can signify success or failure to a company . Hence , it is critical for high tech companies to understand their legal exposure in their industry category and from their competitors to be successful in such patent litigations . Despite the increasing number of arguments and lawsuits , there are no reliable unbiased data mining methods on the patterns and trends of patent litigation in the United States[8 ] This paper aims to enable high tech companies to develop data driven intellectual property business strategies to succeed in their challenging environments . For example , the Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi is being targeted by a US based patent troll . The troll company ( Blue Spike LLS ) filed a lawsuit against Xiaomi in a US district court at the end of 2015 . Thus , as Forbes reported , Xiaomi may have a major patent problem if it wants to enter the US market . Xiaomi operates as an investment holding company and uses its subsidiaries for the development and transfer of its technologies and intellectual properties .
This paper has two aims : 1 ) to predict the litigation risk in a specific industry category for high tech companies , and 2 ) to predict the litigation risk from competitors for the high tech companies . To achieve these goals and to identify the risky industry categories and competitors for high tech companies , we must consider several factors . We must consider the litigation risk if a company wants to enter a new market , and further consider the risk that a potential competitor would file a lawsuit against the new entrant . The risks must be formally estimated . These issues can be answered by mining historical investigation cases and related patents . Specifically , we develop two matrixes : 1 ) the company{category matrix predicts the litigation risk in a specific industry category for a high tech company and 2 ) the complainant{respondent matrix predicts the litigation risk from the competitors for a high tech company . We propose two methods to meet the needs of both aims : a proximal slope one predictor and a time aware predictor . The proposed methods can work on different conditions , that is , companies previously engaged in lawsuits and companies never engaged in a lawsuit . Finally , we carry out extensive experiments on a real world data set collected from the USITC . The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods . With the results of this paper , high tech companies could adjust their strategies for development and explore space for market .
Overview . The paper is organized as follows . Section 2 describes the data used in this paper and introduces the trends of patent litigation in the United States . Section 3 formulates the problem of patent litigation prediction for high tech companies , and introduces some preliminary matters in prediction . Section 4 and Section 5 describe the proposed methods , the proximal slope one predictor and timeaware predictor , respectively . Section 6 discusses the results of our study . Section 7 outlines some related works . Finally , Section 8 provides a conclusion and some suggestions for future research .
2 . DATA DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS 2.1 Data Description
This paper uses several data sources . The first comes from USITC Section 337 investigation cases1 . We analyze Section 337 case data ( a sample is shown in Figure 2 ) for the period of 1982{2014 . We find that 857 of the 906 cases in that period concern patent infringements , and 623 of these cases list the related patents . There are 1,654 patents , including design and utility patents . Several patents are used in multiple investigations .

We also use patent grants data from USPTO Bulk Downloads2 . This public dataset is provided by the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) . Each patent publication contains a group of structured and unstructured information . The USPTO updates the patent application publication each week . We first download the patent data package and retrieved the weekly data package files . We then import the patent data ( in XML format ) to our own local database . Finally , we retrieve the information from this local database using the ID of 1,654 patents as queries . The final data source used is the industry category for the companies . It is difficult to identify the industry category of a company in relation to its patents . Each of the Section 337 investigation cases of patent infringement is associated

128 with one or more patents , and each US patent has at least one class number . In this study , we determine the industry category by the patents that a company holds . However , US patents have 1,088 classifications in total . Therefore , we reclassify the US patent data according to 56 industry categories with a mapping table . 2.2 Data Analysis
We analyze the Section 337 investigation cases by regions and the companies involved .
Figure 3 shows the top 10 Section 337 investigation regions from 1982{2014 . The figure shows that the allegations relating to patent infringements vary across regions over time . In the 1980s and early 1990s , Japan was the most intensively investigated country , accounting for 43.15 % of the total number of cases . Mainland China and Chinese Taiwan were also frequently investigated in the period 1982{2004 . The Chinese mainland is currently the most frequent respondent in Section 337 investigations . Since 2004 , Chinese products and companies have been involved in over 40 % of Section 337 investigations , as the export volume of a region to the United States influences the number of patent litigations . When the trade volume of a country or region increases substantially with rapid economic development , the number of Section 337 investigations increases correspondingly . Japan , Chinese Taiwan , and Mainland China are all in the same situation .

Figure 4 shows the top 10 Section 337 investigation industry categories for 1982{2014 . The figure shows that most of the cases are in material equipment domains such as building material processing equipment and assembly and material handling equipment , which are covered by a large number of patents . Electrical communication domains , including image and sound equipment and telecommunication , are also responsible for many Section 337 investigations .
Figure 5 shows the top 10 Section 337 investigation complainants for 1982{2014 . We find that most of the complainants are large high tech companies that hold core technologies and monopolistic advantages in their related domains . Such companies are motivated to retain their dominant position and to exclude competitors from the market . Figure 6 shows the top 10 Section 337 investigation respondents for 1982{2014 . We find that Section 337 investigations are associated with companies that experience explosive growth . The top four respondents are all smartphone companies . The telecommunication sector has undergone

3 . PROBLEM FORMULATION
In this section , we introduce some preliminary matters , and then formally define the problem of minimizing the legal exposure of high tech companies . 3.1 Preliminary Matters
A relatively small number of companies are involved in Section 337 investigations ; however , the number of patents flfl(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:76)(cid:45)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:71)(cid:42)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:92)(cid:43)(cid:74)fi(cid:74)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:72)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:79)(cid:71)YearCasesflfl(cid:86)(cid:74)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:43)(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:87)(cid:78)(cid:85)(cid:71)(cid:76)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:87)fi(cid:76)(cid:76)(cid:74)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:73)(cid:87)(cid:78)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:79)(cid:76)(cid:36)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:75)(cid:76)YearCasesflflfl(cid:42)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:86)(cid:74)fi(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:85)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:78)(cid:76)(cid:43)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:75)fifi(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:92)fi(cid:85)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:36)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:74)fi(cid:72)(cid:79)(cid:72)(cid:43)(cid:76)(cid:87)(cid:75)(cid:76)(cid:85)(cid:86)(cid:72)(cid:71)fi(cid:73)(cid:85)(cid:87)(cid:76)YearCases129 is quite large . To reduce the number of calculations and enhance the precision , we analyze the data by patent category rather than by patent itself . Thus , individual patents are replaced by their corresponding patent classifications . As Section 337 investigations only protect the patents of United States , thus , we use the United States Patent Classification ( USPC ) system . The USPC system has 1,088 patent classes , making it difficult to identify the patent classification for a company . Thus , we further amalgamate the USPC classifications into industry categories . There are some works on patent classification mapping [ 13 ] , we employ a common standards to map the USPC classifications into 56 industry categories .
To construct the company{category matrix , we need to first construct the company{classification matrix . The number of times that a company has undergone a Section 337 investigation determines its value in the matrix . After the normalization process , the company{classification value ranges between zero and five . Formula 1 is used to normalize the company classification value as follows :
∗ x i = xi − xmin xmax − xmin fi
( 1 ) where xi indicates the actual number of patents in a patent classification related to Section 337 investigation cases that ∗ the company is involved in , x i indicates the normalized value , xmin and xmax indicate the minimum and maximum number of patents related with Section 337 investigation cases , respectively . fi is set to 5 for normalizing the value from 0 to 5 .
The company{classification matrix is then transferred into the company{category matrix with a patent classification{ industry category mapping table . The proposed methods are used to calculate the prediction values in this matrix .
A sample predicted results of the company{category matrix is shown in Table 1 . Let us consider , for example , the 0.326 rating at the intersection between the row of Company ID 51 and column of Category 10 . This rating indicates that there is a 0.326 probability that Adidas America Inc . ( Company ID 51 ) may be investigated under the bleaching and dyeing industry category ( Category 10 ) .
In the same way we develop the complainant{respondent matrix . The total number of Section 337 investigation cases is not large enough , such that the complainant{respondent matrix is quite sparse . Take cases in 2014 as an example , for company pairs , there are only 564 non zero values of the 2 million values in the matrix . For the full duration data set used in this paper , there are 3,370 non zero values for company pairs in the matrix . 3.2 Recommendation Framework
Here , we convert the legal exposure prediction problem to a recommendation problem . We first try to recommend the riskiest industry category and the riskiest competitor for a high tech company . We then formally define the problem of legal exposure recommendation with time awareness .
Definition 1 . We have company c , and a set of industry categories A = a , each of which contains a set of investigation probabilities pai . The goal of the legal exposure recommendation is to build an optimal ranked list of industry categories .
Definition 2 . We have company c , and a set of competitors B = b , each of which contains a set of investigation probabilities pbi . The goal of the legal exposure recommendation is to build an optimal ranked list of competitors .
The above problem statements raise two issues : • How to mine data relating to the litigation risk of an industry category and how to produce a ranked list fiRiskA = a|a ∈ c according to their risk scores RiskA(a ) .
• How to mine data relating to the litigation risk of a competitor and how to produce a ranked list fiRiskB = b|b ∈ c according to their risk scores RiskB(b ) .
Although it is desirable to minimize legal exposure for high tech companies , it is not an easy task to effectively discover and evaluate the litigation risks of both industry category and competitors . Patent litigation is a complex legal action and there are many factors to consider in a recommendation . Thus , it is difficult to answer how to efficiently manage litigation risk for high tech companies . To this end , in this paper , we propose a novel recommendation framework to solve this problem .
Figure 7 : The recommendation framework .
Figure 7 shows the proposed recommendation framework , which consists of the two aims . Litigation risk of industry category predicts the legal exposure in a specific industry category for high tech companies . Litigation risk of competitor predicts the litigation risk from competitors for high tech companies .
4 . PROXIMAL SLOPE ONE PREDICTOR This section proposes a proximal slope one predictor as the recommendation algorithm to predict the litigation risk for high tech companies in a specific industry category . In Section 337 investigations , the litigation procedures of various companies in an industry category are quite different . Slope One algorithm[9 ] is suitable to settle this problem . However , Slope One algorithm only improve the problem of item rating deviation without considering the difference between the items . Hence , the quality and performance of the recommender system are unsatisfactory for our problem . Because the investigations of companies other than the target company in different industry categories will affect the prediction accuracy , we therefore improved the Slope One

In this paper , the kmeans algorithm and the Slope One algorithm are combined to predict the litigation risk . The prediction value of the knearest neighbor vectors of the target company should be calculated using a sub matrix of the company{classification matrix . This not only decreases the amount of calculations , but also relieves the problems caused by data sparseness . Specifically , we first establish patent classification vectors of the companies according to the historical patents related to Section 337 investigation cases . The k means algorithm is employed to cluster the vectors into K clusterings . Then the k nearest neighbor companies of the target company are screened and are used to construct the sub matrix of the company{classification matrix . The prediction value in the sub matrix is calculated using the Slope One algorithm . Finally , we transfer the company{classification matrix to the company{category matrix . We can predict the litigation risk of the target company based on the company{category matrix . Suppose the patent classification vector of a company can be denoted as X = {xi ; i = 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; n} , where xi is a patent classification and n is the total number of US patent classifications . The m vectors X are then clustered into K clusterings as C = {ck ; k = 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; K} , where each ck denotes a vector group of similar companies . Suppose k is the clustering center of ck , the distance between each patent classification vector of a company and the clustering center can be calculated as :
∑
J(ck ) = xi∈ck
∥xi − ki∥2
( 2 ) where ki is the value of the i th patent classification of k . For each company , we can obtain k nearest neighbor patent classification vectors with the result of clusterings , and construct a sub matrix Aij . The Slope One algorithm is employed to predict the values Rij in the sub matrix . Basically , a Slope One algorithm is used as follows . Suppose x and y indicate the value of two patent classifications by company u . The two values conform to the linear relation y = x + b , where b is the parameter , and we obtain the estimated value ^b of parameter b . After substituting the known value x , we obtain the estimated rating ^y by company u . Formula 3 is used to calculate the value devj;i between the target item Itemj and item Itemi . Formula 4 is then used to obtain the prediction value P ( u)j : devj;i =
∑ ∑ u∈Sj;i(x ) i∈Rj uj − ui card(Sj;i(x ) )
( devj;i + ui )
P ( u)j = card(Rj )
( 3 )
( 4 ) where Sj;i(x ) indicates the set of companies who have corated items Itemj and Itemi and Rj indicates the set of items that have been rated by user u . The number of elements in a set S is card(S ) .
As shown in Algorithm 1 , in the proposed recommendation algorithm , using the company{classification matrix , Rm×n indicates the historical data of Section 337 investigations . Here m indicates the number of companies , n indicates the number of classifications , and Rij indicates the normalized number of Section 337 investigation cases that company i filed according to the patent classification j .

5 . TIME AWARE PREDICTORS
This section proposes time aware predictors as recommendation algorithms to predict the litigation risk for high tech companies from their competitors . The proposed algorithm is based on a matrix factorization model that has been well studied in recent years . It is a popular model in the area of recommendation because it combines good scalability with predictive accuracy . Additionally , this model is very
131 flexible when modeling various temporal real life situations . We improve the basic matrix factorization model [ 7 ] with a time shifting baseline predictor . We combine the timechanging baseline predictor and the time shifting baseline predictor to meet the needs of our problem . There are two different conditions , which are 1 ) a company pair that has no historical litigations , and 2 ) a company pair with historical litigations . The first condition is settled with the time changing baseline predictor , and the second is settled with the time shifting baseline predictor . 5.1 Static Baseline Predictor
As shown in Figures 5 and 6 , the number of Section 337 investigation cases is time dependent . Before we deal with temporal effects , we would like to establish the foundations of a static baseline predictor . A pure matrix factorization model could serve well in capturing the interaction between the users and items in a recommendation system . However , most of the observed values of litigation cases are due to effects independent of the interaction associated with either complainants or respondents . For example , typical Section 337 investigation data exhibit large complainant and respondent biases . That is , some companies initiate more investigations than other companies , and some companies face more investigations than others . We will encapsulate those effects , which do not involve complainant respondent interactions , within the baseline predictors [ 7 ] . These baseline predictors tend to capture much of the observed values , in particular much of the temporal dynamics within the data . Hence , it is vital to model them accurately , which enables the better identification of the part of the values that truly represents complainant{respondent interactions and should be subject to factorization .
Now we discuss how to construct a static baseline predictor . Suppose each complainant u is associated with vector pu and each respondent i is associated with vector qi . The overall average number of investigation cases is denoted by . A baseline predictor for an unknown value rui is denoted by the observed deviations bu and bi of complainant u and respondent i , respectively , from the average as follows :
∑ u∈R(i)(rui − u ) ∑ 1 + |R(i)| u∈R(u)(rui − u − bi )
2 + |R(u)| bi = bu = where 1 and 2 are regularization parameters which make the values of bi and bu shrink towards zero . Here 1 = 10 , 2 = 25 .
The static baseline predictor should then be integrated back into a factor model . The value is predicted by the rule :
To determine the vectors pu and qi , we minimize the reg
^rui = + bi + bu + qT i pu
∑ ularized squared error : min qfi;pfi;bfi
( u;i)∈K
( rui − − bi − bu − qT 3(∥qi∥2 + ∥pu∥2 + b2 i pu)2+ i + b2 u ) bi = bi + fl(eui − 3 · bi ) bu = bu + fl(eui − 3 · bu ) qi = qi + fl(eui · pu − 4 · pi ) pu = pu + fl(eui · qi − 4 · pu ) where eui is the prediction error as follows : · pu ) eui = rui − ( + bi + bu + qT i

5.2 Time changing Baseline Predictor
In this section , we discuss the following temporal effects which include in the baseline predictors : ( 1 ) complainant biases bu change over time ; ( 2 ) respondent biases bi change over time ; ( 3 ) complainant preferences pu change over time ; and ( 4 ) respondent preferences qi change over time . Hence , in our models we would like to take the parameters as functions of time . For our problem of litigation risk prediction , it ’s no need to get the finest resolution . Thus , an adequate decision would be to split the biases into time based bins . We employ a distinct bias for each time period related with a single bin . Such decision should strike a balance for the desire to achieve a finer resolution with enough ratings per bin . Considering the features of Section 337 litigation cases , we select 3 years as the bin size . We define the bias functions bi(t ) of the respondent i , changing by year t , as follows : bi(t ) = bi + bi·Bin(t )
( 14 ) where bi·Bin(t ) is the bias of respondent i in those bins that contain year t .
In the same way , we define the bias functions bu(t ) of the complainant u , changing by year t : bu(t ) = bu + ff · devu(t )
( 15 ) where devu(t ) is the associated time deviation . If u files a lawsuit in the year t , devu(t ) is defined as : devu(t ) = sign(t − tu ) · |t − tu|fi
( 16 ) where |t − tu| measures the time distance between t and tu . Furthermore , tu is the average duration of Section 337 investigation cases of complainant u , which can be calculated as : tu = tu(⌈ nl − 1
2
⌉ )
( 17 ) where nl denotes the most recent Section 337 investigation case of complainant u .
Moreover , we note that the complainants’ preferences change with time , leading to changes in the interactions between complainant and respondent . For example , if one company files a lawsuit against another company several times , the respondent may strike back . Suppose the feature vector of a company has k dimensions , the changing function of preferences is defined as : puk(t ) = puk + puk·Bin(t )

The parameters are updated as follows : where puk captures the stationary portion of the factor and Puk·Bin(t ) approximates a possible portion that changes in those bins containing year t .
Thus , the prediction rule is as follows :

5.3 Time shifting Baseline Predictor
The time changing baseline predictor only considers the bias of the complainant and respondent in the current time period . Practical application shows that litigation should be predicted based on the bias in the prior time period . Thus , the time shift characteristics of bias are studied in this paper : Shif t(t ) denotes the bias in a period of time , bi·Shif t(t ) denotes the time shift bias of the complainant , bu·Shif t(t ) denotes the time shift bias of the respondent , and pu·Shif t(t ) denotes the time shift bias of the complainant ’s suppressed feature vector . We then extend the bias functions denoted in the prior section as follows : bi(t ) = bi + bi·Shif t(t ) bu(t ) = bu + bu·Shif t(t ) pu(t ) = pu + pu·Shif t(t )
Then the prediction rule is as follows :
^rui = + bi(t ) + bu(t ) + qT i pu(t )
( 24 )
( 25 )
( 26 )
( 27 )
We then split the data set into two groups : data of lawsuits before time t and data of lawsuits at time t . For the first data group , we employ a basic matrix algorithm to optimize the parameters bu , bi , qi and pu . For the second data group , to determine the involved parameters pu·Shif t(t ) , bu·Shif t(t ) , and bi·Shif t(t ) , we need to solve :
∑ min
( u;i)∈K
( rui − − bi(t ) − bu(t ) − qT 6(∥pu·Shif t(t)∥2 + b2 i pu(t))2+ u·Shif t(t ) + b2 i·Shif t(t ) )
( 28 ) where the constant 6 controls the extent of regularization , as usually determined by cross validation . In this paper , minimization is performed by stochastic gradient descent . The parameters are updated as follows : bi·Shif t(t ) = bi·Shif t(t ) + fl(eui − 6 · bi·Shif t(t ) ) bu·Shif t(t ) = bu·Shif t(t ) + fl(eui − 6 · bu·Shif t(t ) ) pu·Shif t(t ) = pu·Shif t(t ) + fl(eui · pi − 7 · pu·Shif t(t ) )
Furthermore , eui is the prediction error : eui = rui − ^rui
( 32 ) where rui is the number of lawsuit filed by u against i in year t , ^rui is the predicted value based on the data before year t . As the exact value and predicted value are obtained from different durations , time shifting trends are considered in our method .
As shown in Algorithm 2 , in the proposed recommendation algorithm , the time changing predictor trains the bias during a large range of time , and does not distinguish the conditions . Thus , it shows high accuracy for those companies without prior lawsuits . The time shifting predictor trains the bias in the duration before year t . This indicates the shifting trend from the duration before year t and after year t . It provides high accuracy for those companies with prior lawsuits .

We use root mean square error ( RMSE ) to measure the prediction performance of the proposed algorithms . The smaller the RMSE values , the better the prediction accuracy of the algorithms . The RMSE formula are defined as follows :
√∑
RM SE =

133 6.2 Evaluation of Predictor for Industry Cat egory
In the experiments , we employ k fold cross validation . The data is divided into k roughly equal sized parts ( k = 5 here ) . Of the k parts , a single part is retained as the validation data for testing the predictor , and the remaining k − 1 parts are used as training data . We use 1691 cases in the test set ( out of 8,455 total cases in the data set ) . We then make recommendations for 2,806 companies , with an average of 2.41 observations per company for the entire training set .
We adopt three state of the art baselines to evaluate the performances of our proximal slope one predictor . The first baseline is a traditional collaborative filtering algorithm , that is , an item based collaborative filtering algorithm ( IBCF ) . The second baseline is matrix factorization algorithm ( MF ) , which is one of the most popular approaches to collaborative filtering . Moreover , we also use a popular slope one algorithm , that is , a bi polar slope one algorithm , as the third baseline . All results reported below come from the same test set to facilitate comparison . 621 Recommendation Performances We set up the evaluation as follows . First , we implemented our proximal slope one predictor and other baselines on the test data set . Specifically , by performing the proximal slope one predictor , we rate the company{category matrix . We then obtain the RMSE value by comparing the results with the original rating . We set the clustering parameters k as 20 , and it remained invariant during the experiment .
Figures 8 show the results of each approach . In the figure we can see that our approach consistently outperforms other baselines and the improvement is significant . These results clearly validate the effectiveness of our proximal slope one predictor . foundation , without clustering . The IBCF simply analyzes the similarity according to the investigation categories , and does not consider the degree of association between the categories . This means that the result is flawed . The bi polar slope one algorithm analyzes the rating data that have been divided into two groups , according to the preference of the company regarding category . The disadvantage of this algorithm is that two totally different results will be produced when two ratings are close to the average value , but one is bigger than the average and the other is smaller . In the company{category matrix , there are a lot of data around the average : this leads to large errors when using the bi polar slope one algorithm . Our approach only considers the data set that belongs to the same category as the target type . This minimizes the influence of unrelated categories , giving the highest prediction accuracy . However , in our approach , because of data sparseness , the nearest neighbor number of some types cannot achieve the number in the experimental setup . Thus , predicted partial results are not sufficiently accurate . 6.3 Evaluation of Predictor for Competitors In these experiments , we divide the data set into training data and test data according to date . There are two experiments in this section : the first experiment used data from 2000 to 2012 as training data and data from 2013 as test data ; the second experiment used data from 2000 to 2013 as training data and data from 2014 as test data . Figure 9 compares the results of the two proposed predictors . We can see that the results for the two years are similar .

622 Case Study To further evaluate the performances of the different approaches , we randomly select 10 cases including 8 companies for case study . The results of the case study are shown in Table 2 . Two companies ( Company ID 200 , 587 ) fall within two categories . The closer the difference between the predicted value and the rating , the better the prediction accuracy of the algorithm . According to the results , the prediction value of Proximal Slope One algorithm is closer to the original rating than that of the other three approaches . The extreme sparseness of the company category matrix results that the parameters of MF could not be fully trained and optimized . Our approach is superior to matrix factorization algorithm due to no need of parameter training and optimizing . The IBCF and the bi polar slope one algorithms use all of the data from the training data set as their prediction

For the setting of the number of iterations , if the number is smaller , the fitting degree of training is not high enough . However , if the number of iterations is larger , there might be overfitting . Thus , based on the results of the test , we set the number of iterations as 40 .
As shown in Figure 9 , the time changing predictor performs better than the time shifting predictor in the conditions of overall company pairs and company pairs with no historical lawsuits . In fact , it ’s extremely difficult to predict the legal exposure for a company without historical lawsuit data . It ’s even harder to predict the data in 2014 than in 2013 , since there are much more new companies involved in Section 337 investigations in 2014 . The rate of new companies ( 20 ) out of all companies ( 651 ) in 2013 is 0.0307 , while the rate of new companies ( 49 ) out of all companies ( 564 ) in 2014 is 00869 On the other hand , the time shifting predictor performed better in other conditions . This indicates that if a company pair has never been engaged in a lawsuit , and has a lawsuit in the test year , we can predict using the timechanging predictor . If a company pair has been engaged in a lawsuit previously , we can predict using the time shifting predictor . It should be noted that the proposed approaches do have some limitations . If the company pair has been involved in a lawsuit previously , and has no lawsuit in the test year , it is difficult to predict using either of our approaches .
7 . RELATED WORKS
Patent litigation covers both legal and technical issues , and is also a key concern of managers when making strategic decisions . Furthermore , patent litigation influences the market value of a company . Lerner ’s research[10 ] shows that patent litigation can decrease the market value of the respondent companies by 2%{31 % Such lawsuits are usually used to prevent imitation by other companies . The patentee prevents the infringement use of technology via litigation . The technology barriers constructed by litigation can transform into market entry barriers . Such barriers guarantee that the patentee retains its dominant position in the market . Lanjouw and Schankerman[8 ] argued there is a relationship between the characteristics of patents and the likelihood that they will become involved in infringement lawsuits . Chien[3 ] shows that whether a patent is going to be litigated depends on the economic value of the patent , the characteristics of the patent owner , and the owner ’s propensity to litigate . By studying all of the infringement claims for a sample of recently expired patents , Love[12 ] found considerable differences in litigation practices between practicing and non practicing entities . Product producing companies usually enforce their patents soon after issuance , and complete their enforcement activities well before their patent rights expire .
Existing research on patent recommendation have largely focused on method/approach , system/software , and patent derivatives ( eg , collaborator , maintenance ) . Most of the patent recommendation methods/approaches have been based on retrieval techniques and ranking methods . Bashir[1 ] proposed a query expansion method using pseudo relevance feedback to increase the retrievability of patents . Cao[2 ] proposed a new user friendly patent search paradigm and introduced three techniques ( error correction , topic based query suggestion , and query expansion ) to improve the usability of patent searches . Oh[16 ] proposed a CV PCR framework with a heterogeneous patent citation bibliographic network that combines both patent citations ( reflecting value relation ) and bibliographic information ( reflecting similarity relation ) . Based on this network , they proposed valuedriven and context guided features . Magdy[15 ] reported a comparison between simple and straightforward information retrieval techniques[14 ] and much more sophisticated techniques[11 ] in patent searches . Their experiments showed that the advanced search technique is statistically better only when no initial citations are provided .
Jie Tang[17 ] presented a topic driven patent analysis and mining system ( PatentMiner ) , which mainly focuses on mining heterogeneous patent networks . They proposed a dynamic probabilistic model to characterize the topical evolution of different objects in a heterogeneous network . The system uses patent summarization and technology trend visualization . Hasan[4]built a patent ranking software ( Claim Originality Analysis ) that rates a patent based on its value by measuring its age and the impact of the important phrases that appear in the \claims" section of the patent . Bo[5 ] designed an indicator to understand technology prospecting by studying the evolving distributions of technologies in high tech companies .
The research mentioned above largely focused on patent content . Other relevant studies have also been conducted such as partner recommendation and maintenance decisions . Wu[18 ] studied the problem of recommending patenting partners in enterprise social networks and proposed a ranking factor graph model to suggest co invention relationships . Jin[6 ] proposed a systematic solution to analyze patents to recommend patent maintenance decisions . In their approach , the patents are modeled as a heterogeneous timeevolving information network and new patent features are
135 proposed to build models for a ranked prediction on whether to maintain or abandon a patent .
8 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper , we developed a recommendation framework for patent litigation risk prediction . The proposed framework clearly provides risky industry categories and risky competitors for high tech companies when entering the US market . The design , analysis , and deployment of our recommendation framework are introduced in this paper . Specifically , we first acquired related information of Section 337 cases from USITC , and integrated it into a data set . We also presented the results of our statistical analysis , at both a regional and company level . Two methods of collaborative filtering , that is , proximal slope one predictor and time aware predictor , are proposed in this paper . Finally , we evaluated our methods with extensive experiments on the real world data set . The experimental results clearly validate the effectiveness of our methods .
Potentially , this study has many future research directions . First , it would be interesting to investigate new recommendation models to improve the accuracy of litigation risk prediction . Second , we plan to build a professional recommendation system to predict litigation risk for high tech companies .
