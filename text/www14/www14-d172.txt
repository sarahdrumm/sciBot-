ABSTRACT In this paper , we provide a characterization of the topological features of the Twitter follow graph , analyzing properties such as degree distributions , connected components , shortest path lengths , clustering coefficients , and degree assortativity . For each of these properties , we compare and contrast with available data from other social networks . These analyses provide a set of authoritative statistics that the community can reference . In addition , we use these data to investigate an often posed question : Is Twitter a social network or an information network ? The “ follow ” relationship in Twitter is primarily about information consumption , yet many follows are built on social ties . Not surprisingly , we find that the Twitter follow graph exhibits structural characteristics of both an information network and a social network . Going beyond descriptive characterizations , we hypothesize that from an individual user ’s perspective , Twitter starts off more like an information network , but evolves to behave more like a social network . We provide preliminary evidence that may serve as a formal model of how a hybrid network like Twitter evolves .

INTRODUCTION
We provide a characterization of the topological properties of a snapshot of the Twitter follow graph with two goals : First , we present a set of authoritative descriptive statistics that the community can reference for comparison purposes . Second , we use these characterizations to offer new insight into a question that many have asked : Is Twitter a social network or an information network ?
To answer this question in a meaningful way , we must first define a social network . Unfortunately , there is no universally accepted definition by researchers in network science . However , one can point to a prototype such as Facebook , which researchers would all agree is a social network .

Our operational definition of a social network is simply one that exhibits characteristics we observe in other social networks . These include high degree assortativity , small shortest path lengths , large connected components , high clustering coefficients , and a high degree of reciprocity . An information network , on the other hand , is a structure where the dominant interaction is the dissemination of information along edges : these are characterized by large vertex degrees , a lack of reciprocity , and large two hop neighborhoods .
Intuitively , Twitter appears to be both . On the one hand , the follow relationship seems to be primarily about information consumption . Users follow a news outlet not because of any meaningful social relationship , but to receive news . Except in a few special cases , these edges are not reciprocated— this is Twitter being used as an information network . On the other hand , it is undeniable that many follow relationships are built on social ties , eg , following one ’s colleagues , family members , and friends . In these cases , Twitter behaves like a social network . Not surprisingly , our analyses show that the Twitter graph displays characteristics of both an information network and a social network .
Why is this question important ? From an intellectual perspective , we believe that Twitter exemplifies a hybrid system and it is important to understand how such networks arise and evolve . From a practical perspective , a better understanding of user and graph behavior helps us build products that better serve users .
2 . DATA AND METHODS
Our analysis is based on a snapshot of the Twitter follow graph from the second half of 2012 with 175 million active users and approximately twenty billion edges . In addition to the complete follow graph , we also examined the subgraphs associated with three different countries : Brazil ( BR ) , Japan ( JP ) , and the United States ( US ) . Each subgraph contains only vertices corresponding to active users logging in from that particular country . Unlike previous work ( eg , [ 7] ) , our study is based on a complete graph snapshot , and thus our findings are free from artifacts that can be attributed to methodological issues around crawling .
Because the follow relationship is asymmetric , the Twitter follow graph is directed . To facilitate comparisons , our analyses make reference to the undirected mutual graph , which is the graph with just the edges that are reciprocated . An edge between two users in the mutual graph implies that both users follow each other . In all , 42 % of edges in the follow graph are reciprocated , so there are a total of around four billion undirected edges in the mutual graph .

Our findings are contrasted with studies of other social networks : Facebook [ 1 , 14 ] ( 721m vertices , 68.7b undirected edges ) and the network from users of MSN Messenger [ 8 , 13 ] ( 180m vertices , 1.3b undirected edges ) . Properties of these two social networks provide a point of reference .
When considering the size of the Twitter graph , computing exact values of different statistical quantities is challenging . In many cases , we performed approximations , noted in each section . All analyses in this work were conducted on Twitter ’s Hadoop analytics stack using Pig . More details about analytics infrastructure at Twitter can be found elsewhere [ 10 ] .
3 . GRAPH CHARACTERISTICS 3.1 Degree Distributions
Since the Twitter follow graph is directed , vertices have both an inbound degree , or in degree ( the number of users who follow them ) and an outbound degree , or out degree ( the number of users who they follow ) . Figure 1(a ) shows the in degree distribution across all users . Not surprisingly , we see a heavy tail resembling a power law distribution . The out degree distribution in Figure 1(b ) also exhibits a heavy tail , although not to the same extent as the in degree distribution . This is interesting , as one might expect that users’ limited capacity to consume information would set a relatively low upper bound on the number of people they can follow . Instead , some users follow hundreds of thousands of accounts . These are often celebrities who choose to reciprocate the follows of some of their fans ( in some cases , automatically ) . For example , in Summer 2012 , the pop singer Lady Gaga was the most followed user on Twitter , and she followed more than 130k other users ; Barack Obama had 21m followers and followed more than 600k people . In another common case , businesses will reciprocate follows to better connect with customers ( for example , the grocery store chain Whole Foods followed more than 500k people ) . More commonly , journalists have been found to follow many thousands of people .
The presence of users with thousands of followings is indicative of “ non social ” behavior . It has been well established that individuals are only able to maintain around 150 stable social relationships at a time [ 3 ] . Furthermore , it has been established through studying reciprocated direct messaging on Twitter that the number of social relationships a user can effectively maintain is limited by this constraint as well [ 5 ] . Also of note in the out degree distribution is the apparent spike at 2,000 followings . Spambots have been observed in the past to arbitrarily follow a large number of people . To curtail this , Twitter does not allow users to follow more than 2,000 accounts unless they themselves have more than 2,200 followers . This is not to imply that all users who fall in this spike are spambots , but only more well known users can “ break through ” this limit .
The degree distribution of the mutual graph is shown in Figure 1(c ) . Here , we still observe relatively large degrees , although smaller than both the in degrees and out degrees . Figures 1(d ) , 1(e ) , and 1(f ) show the various degree distributions for each of the three country subgraphs . Surprisingly , there is very little variation between them .
Finally , Table 1 shows the statistics of the various degree distributions . In addition to the percentiles of each distribution , we also tried fitting each to both a power law and a log normal distribution . Interestingly , both the in degree distribution and the mutual degree distributions were best fit by a power law , while the out degree distribution was best fit by a log normal . Furthermore , each of the percentiles reported are higher for the out degree distributions compared to the in degree or mutual degree , even though the maximum out degree is much smaller than the maximum indegree . This means that the typical Twitter user follows more people than she has followers , but this does not hold for a small population of “ celebrity ” users who have very large in degrees ( ie , many followers ) .

Conclusion : The degree distributions of the Twitter graph is inconsistent with that of a social network . It is highly unlikely that an individual can maintain as many social relationships as the out degrees of the vertices suggest . 3.2 Connected Components
In directed graphs , the distinction is often made between In a weakly weakly and strongly connected components . connected component , determination of connectivity ignores edge direction , whereas in a strongly connected component , a pair of vertices must be reachable through a directed path . Figure 2 shows the size distribution of the two types of components in the Twitter follow graph . One can see that in both cases , there is a single large component that dwarfs the other components in size . The largest weakly connected component contains 92.9 % of all active users . Of the remaining vertices not in this largest component , the majority are completely disconnected because they contain no edges at all—they default to component sizes of one . Of all vertices with at least one edge ( inbound or outbound ) , the largest weakly connected component contains 99.94 % of all vertices . In contrast , the largest strongly connected component only contains 68.7 % of all active users . This is interesting in that the figure is much lower compared to other social networks— in both the Facebook graph [ 14 ] and the MSN messenger graph [ 8 ] , the largest connected component contains more than 99 % of all vertices . One possible explanation of this is that a reciprocated edge in Twitter is often an indication of a social connection , but perhaps Twitter is not entirely a social network to begin with . In fact , more than 30 % of active users do not have a single mutual edge—these are instances where the user is exclusively using Twitter for either information dissemination or consumption .
Conclusion : Due to the abundance of unreciprocated edges , the Twitter graph is less well connected than one would expect if it were a social network . 3.3 Shortest Path Lengths
The path length between users is the number of traversals along edges required to reach one from another ; the distribution of shortest path lengths quantifies how tightly users are connected . Here , we examine both symmetric paths over the mutual graph as well as directed paths across the follow graph . We see that the Twitter graph exhibits small path lengths between vertices , which previous work has argued to be a typical characteristic of social networks [ 2 ] .
It is computationally infeasible to identify the shortest path length between every pair of vertices in a large graph . For the Twitter follow graph , there are about N × ( N − 1 ) =
2.6×1020 different shortest paths ( where N is the number of connected vertices ) , and the mutual graph has 73×1015 Instead , we make use of the probabilistic shortest path length counter called the HyperANF algorithm [ 2 ] . This counter approximates the size of a user ’s neighborhood after a certain number of traversals using the HyperLogLog counter [ 4 ] , which gives a probabilistic estimate of the number of unique items in a large stream . The number of shortest paths of length n through which a user is connected can be approximated as the change in her neighborhood size after the nth jump . This technique was also used to analyze the Facebook graph [ 1 ] . For the HyperLogLog counter , we found that using registers of length 64 for each user ( which leads to a relative standard deviation of accuracy of about 0.1325 ) to be sufficient for our purposes .
Figure 3 shows the distribution of both types of shortest path lengths in the Twitter follow graph . The average path length is 4.17 for the mutual graph and 4.05 for the directed graph . This is shorter than the social networks to which we compare ( in both the directed and undirected cases ) : the average path length for Facebook is 4.74 , and for MSN messenger , 66 The average degree of the MSN messenger graph is much lower than that of the mutual graph so perhaps this is less surprising , but the average degree of a vertex in the Facebook graph is higher than both the Twitter follow graph and mutual graph . Despite the fact that the Facebook graph has a higher branching factor ( and a larger clustering coefficient—see below ) , users in the Twitter graph appear to be more closely connected . Note that although the Facebook graph contains more vertices , previous work suggests that in social networks the average path length should actually decrease with size [ 9]—this makes the short average path lengths in Twitter more surprising .
The spid ( dispersion of the path length distribution ) is another important graph metric . It is the ratio of the variance of the distribution to the mean of the distribution : social networks have a spid of less than one while web graphs have a spid greater than one . The spid of the mutual path length distribution is 0.115 , and 0.108 for the directed path length distribution . These are well within the “ social ” range , but are slightly higher than that of the Facebook graph ( 0.09)— suggesting that the distribution for the Twitter graph is slightly “ wider ” than that of the Facebook graph .
The path length distribution of each country subgraph does not deviate much from that of the entire graph . The results are shown in Table 2 . Brazil is the most tightlyconnected subgraph with an average shortest path length of 3.78 , and the US has the largest average shortest path length of 437 Note that these findings do not necessarily contradict the results of Leskovec et al .

Conclusion : Analysis of the shortest path lengths and spid shows that the Twitter follow graph exhibits properties that are consistent with a social network . 3.4 Clustering Coefficient
The clustering coefficient [ 15 ] in social networks measures the fraction of users whose friends are themselves friends— a high clustering coefficient is another property commonly attributed to social networks . Here , we examine the local clustering coefficient of vertices in the Twitter mutual graph . Figure 4(a ) plots the average local clustering coefficient against the vertex degree . As expected , the local clustering coefficient decreases with increasing degree . While the clustering coefficient of the Twitter mutual graph is lower than that of the Facebook graph , it is still in the range that one would expect of a social network . Ugander et al . [ 14 ] found that the average clustering coefficient for degree = 5 is about 0.4 in the Facebook graph , compared to Twitter mutual graph ’s 0.23 ; for degree = 20 , Facebook is 0.3 and the mutual graph is 019 Around degree = 100 , the two graphs become very comparable with a coefficient around 014 Even though the clustering coefficient of the Twitter mutual graph is lower than that of Facebook ’s , it is still more tightly clustered than the MSN Messenger graph : for degree = 5 the mutual graph ’s clustering coefficient is more than 50 % greater than that of the MSN graph , and for degree = 20 it is ∼90 % greater .
Also of interest are the differences between the three countries shown in Figure 4(b ) . First , Japan has a higher clustering coefficient compared to the US or Brazil , and it is also higher overall compared to the entire globe . In Japan , the rate of reciprocity is much higher ( ie , if you follow someone , the chances that they follow you back is much higher )

Figure 5 : The size of users’ inbound and outbound two hop neighborhoods as a function of their degree . and so the mutual graph has a higher edge to vertex ratio . What is even more interesting is that the clustering coefficient in the Japan subgraph begins to increase with degree at around a degree of 200 and peaks at a degree of 1,000 . One possible explanation for this is the presence of massive cliques : members of these cliques would have high degrees as well as high clustering coefficients . The increase in clustering coefficients for large degrees in the overall graph , as in Figure 4(a ) , can be attributed to this idiosyncrasy in the Japan subgraph . Conclusion : Analysis of clustering coefficients in the Twitter mutual graph suggests that Twitter exhibits characteristics that are consistent with a social network . 3.5 Two Hop Neighborhoods
An important consideration in network analysis is a vertex ’s two hop neighborhood , ie , the set of vertices that are neighbors of a vertex ’s neighbors . Many algorithms , particularly edge prediction algorithms , use this set of vertices as the starting point for predicting the formation of new edges [ 6 ] . In the context of Twitter , the directed nature of the follow graph creates two such neighborhoods : the set of a vertex ’s followers’ followers ( inbound two hop ) and the set of a vertex ’s followings’ followings ( outbound two hop ) .
Viewed from the perspective of an information network , the outbound two hop neighborhood characterizes the “ information gathering potential ” of a particular user , in that any tweet or retweet from those vertices has the potential of reaching the user . Similarly , the inbound two hop neighborhood characterizes the “ information dissemination potential ” of the user , in that any retweet of the user ’s tweet has the potential of reaching those vertices .
As expected , followers of a user ’s followers are often not unique ( it is likely that at least one user follows two people that follow the original user ) , so we consider both the unique and non unique two hop neighborhoods . The nonunique two hop inbound neighborhood is simply the sum of the inbound degrees of a user ’s followers . To approximate the size of the unique second degree neighborhoods , we used the HyperANF algorithm described earlier .
Comparisons between the unique and non unique two hop neighborhoods are informative . If they are close in value , then the number of edges between users within those neighborhoods is low . This would also imply that , for instance , gaining a new follower dramatically increases the size of the two hop neighborhood . This would also mean that the neighborhoods do not exhibit community structure , which provides evidence against Twitter as a social network .
Figures 5(a ) and 5(b ) show the average size of a vertex ’s two hop neighborhoods as a function of its degree . For both

If a user links exclusively to other users with the same degree ( high degree assortativity—see below ) , then these ( non unique ) neighborhoods would be exactly of size k2 . From these figures , we see that most users have two hop neighborhoods greater than k2 ; it is not until a user has an inbound/outbound degree of greater than around 3,000 that the neighborhood sizes are less than k2 . The fact that the two hop neighborhoods are usually much larger than would be predicted by the branching factor ( both inbound and outbound ) suggests that there is a type of amplification effect . From the average Twitter user ’s perspective , the structure of the graph is very efficient for both information gathering ( outbound ) and information dissemination ( inbound ) .
What is also striking about these plots is that for inbound/outbound degree of less than around 100 , the number of unique and non unique two hop neighbors is practically the same . For example , the first 100 or so followers that a Twitter user receives adds almost all of the new user ’s followers as unique secondary followers . More specifically , for users with an inbound degree of less than 100 , each new follower a user receives adds on average 4770 new secondary followers . Similarly , each new follow a user makes connects her to 3573 new secondary followings .
It is worth comparing these results to the Facebook graph . A Facebook user with 100 friends typically has 27,500 unique friends of friends . This more than an order of magnitude less than the 497,000 ( unique ) followers of followers of a typical Twitter user with 100 followers , or the 367,000 ( unique ) followings of followings of a user who follows 100 other users .
Conclusion : Analysis of two hop neighborhoods suggests that Twitter behaves efficiently as an information network since the graph structure exhibits a pronounced amplification effect for information dissemination and reception . 3.6 Degree Assortativity
Degree assortativity , sometimes called assortative mixing , is the preference for a graph ’s vertices to attach to others that are similar ( or dissimilar ) in degree . Typically , this is quantified in terms of the correlation of the vertex degrees on either side of each edge [ 11 ] . Newman and Park [ 12 ] argue that degree assortativity is a fundamental characteristic that separates social networks from all other types of large scale networks . In most social networks , an assortative measure between 0.1 and 0.4 is typical ; for example , the Facebook global network measures 0226
Most previous analyses of degree assortativity have looked at undirected graphs . In the Twitter case , it is appropriate to look at both in degree and out degree correlations . This requires us to extend the standard formulation , illustrated in Figure 6 . To be precise , in our analysis “ source ” refers to the follower , and “ destination ” refers to the person being followed . We consider four cases associated with each edge : source in degree ( SID ) , source out degree ( SOD ) , destination in degree ( DID ) , and destination out degree ( DOD ) .
In looking at the Pearson correlations across these degree measures , we find almost no correlation—most likely due to the heavy tails of the distributions . A more informative measure is the correlation of the logarithm of the degrees . Specifically , if x and y are two different types of degrees

Figure 6 : A diagram of the four different types of degrees between which we examine correlations . associated with an edge , then we can measure the Pearson correlation coefficient between log(x + 1 ) and log(y + 1 ) . This measures whether or not the degrees are correlated in magnitude . Below , we examine each of these correlations in turn ( all of which are significant ) :
SOD vs . DOD has a positive correlation ( 0272 ) This means that the more people you follow , the more people that those people are likely to follow . From a social network perspective , this makes sense : if we interpret “ following ” as social behavior , this correlation represents the type of assortativity we would observe in social networks—social users engage with other social users .
SID vs . DOD has a positive correlation ( 0241 ) On Twitter , the number of followers is typically understood as a measure of popularity ( or notoriety ) . This means that the more popular you are , the people you follow will tend to follow more people . This also appears to be consistent with social network theory : the more popular one becomes , the greater tendency one would engage with other socialable users ( ie , those who follow more people ) . SOD vs . DID has a negative correlation ( −0118 ) This means that the more people you follow , the less popular those people are likely to be . This is highly unexpected , since the fact that the edge is present increases both the SOD and the DID by one , and this would suggest a positive correlation . SID vs . DID has a negative correlation ( −0296 ) This means that the more popular you are , the less popular the people you follow are . In a social network , we would expect that popular people are friends with other popular people— in Twitter terms , we would expect popular users ( ie , with many followers ) to follow other popular users . However , this is not the case , and stands in contrast with social network properties observed by others [ 11 , 12 ] .
Conclusion : Analysis of degree assortativity in the Twitter graph leads to conflicting and counter intuitive results . In some ways , Twitter exhibits characteristics that are consistent with a social network ; in other ways , the results are the opposite of what we observe in other social networks .
4 . DISCUSSION
Quickly recapping the results : some analyses suggest that Twitter behaves more like an information network , but other analyses show that Twitter exhibits characteristics consistent with social networks . Beyond these descriptive characterizations , are there deeper insights that we can glean ?
We are currently developing a model that explains these findings by taking into account the order in which edges in the Twitter follow graph are added . Our hypothesis is that from an individual user ’s perspective , Twitter starts

( c )
Figure 7 : User age versus their in degrees ( a ) and out degrees ( b ) . The source order of an edge versus the in degree of the destination user ( c ) . off more like an information network , but evolves to behave more like a social network . Specifically , the first few accounts that a new user chooses to follow are likely highprofile , popular accounts with large inbound degrees ( ie , many followers ) , driven by preferential attachment—users with high in degrees are more visible and are therefore more likely to receive new edges , further increasing their inbound degrees . However , as a user follows more people and becomes more “ experienced ” using Twitter , the preferential attachment effect diminishes . They become more selective and choose followings based on other criteria beyond popularity . The user typically discovers a community with which to engage—whether it be based on real world social ties , common interests , or other factors—and Twitter starts behaving more like a social network .
One fact that sometimes gets lost in the analysis of a single graph snapshot is that the graph structure is constantly evolving . In particular , users accumulate followers and follow more people over time . This is shown in Figure 7(a ) and ( b ) , where in degree and out degrees are plotted against account age . In reality , our Twitter graph snapshot contains a mix of new users who recently just discovered Twitter and experienced users who have been active for a long time . Most revealing is Figure 7(c ) , where the x axis shows the source order of the edge , or its ordering of when the source vertex added it , and the y axis plots the average inbound degree of the destination vertex of that edge . For example , the 20th account a user chooses to follow has an average in degree of about 500,000 , whereas the 1,000th user has an average in degree of about 70,000 .
These graphs immediately explain many of the degree correlations we observe . SID and DOD are positively correlated because Twitter users tend to gain more followers and follow more accounts over time . The same explanation applies to SOD vs . DOD correlation as well . Figure 7(c ) provides an explanation of why SOD and DID are inversely correlated— users who have lots of outbound edges are choosing followings who have fewer inbound edges . That is , over time , users’ tendency to follow celebrities decreases ( ie , preferential attachment gives way to social ties ) .
5 . FUTURE WORK AND CONCLUSIONS In this paper , we present evidence that Twitter differs from previously studied social networks in certain aspects , but it also demonstrates many social properties as well . Beyond descriptive characterizations that may be independently useful for the community , we have formulated a hy pothesis that attempts to explain these findings and are developing a model to better formalize these ideas .
Ultimately , we believe that there are two major “ modes ” of behavior on Twitter : one that is based upon information consumption , and another that is based upon reciprocated social ties . The network structure we observe results from a mixture of the two , where the mix depends on the age of the account . However , to further analyze this mixture , we need to develop a more precise characterization of information networks and social networks . We provide only preliminary evidence for this hypothesis , but at an intuitive level , this hybrid structure seems to be plausible .
