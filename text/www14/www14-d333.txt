ABSTRACT
Online recommendation sites are valuable information sources that people contribute to , and often use to choose restaurants . However , little is known about the dynamics behind participation in these online communities and how the recommendations in these communities are formed . In this work , we take a first look at online restaurant recommendation communities to study what endogenous ( ie , related to entities being reviewed ) and exogenous factors influence people ’s participation in the communities , and to what extent . We analyze an online community corpus of 840K restaurants and their 1.1M associated reviews from 2002 to 2011 , spread across every US state . We construct models for number of reviews and ratings by community members , based on several dimensions of endogenous and exogenous factors . We find that while endogenous factors such as restaurant attributes ( eg , meal , price , service ) affect recommendations , surprisingly , exogenous factors such as demographics ( eg , neighborhood diversity , education ) and weather ( eg , temperature , rain , snow , season ) also exert a significant effect on reviews . We find that many of the effects in online communities can be explained using offline theories from experimental psychology . Our study is the first to look at exogenous factors and how it related to online online restaurant reviews . It has implications for designing online recommendation sites , and in general , social media and online communities .

INTRODUCTION
Taking a trip to someplace warm in the middle of winter , or being outdoors when spring arrives , can be particularly beneficial . Research shows that pleasant weather improves mood and memory and broadens cognitive performance , thinking and judgement [ 41 , 59 ] . Low levels of humidity and high levels of sunlight are associated with high mood [ 8 , 40 , 48 , 50 ] . Demographics of a region have been associated with people ’s spending time online [ 21 , 22 ] . A common underlying aspect of these observations is that they study exogenous factors – that are generally not considered when studying people ’s online activities such as participation in recommendation communities .

In this paper , we ask the question : might these phenomena documented in psychology studies also affect1 large scale online behavior ? Could weather and local demographics of restaurants drive how we rate them online ?
Review and recommender sites are highly popular online resources . People contribute content in the form of recommendations to these communities . A recent work by Anderson and Magruder [ 2 ] found that an extra half star rating on Yelp causes restaurants to sell out 19 % more frequently . People increasingly base their decisions on input from such online reviews and ratings . A recent survey found that 64 % of consumers search for online reviews before spending on services [ 7 ] , and 85 % of them are more likely to purchase services when they can find online recommendations . The same study found that 87 % of consumers say that positive online reviews reinforce their decisions , while 80 % say that negative online reviews have led them to change their minds . These findings imply significant returns on an extra half star rating or more number of reviews and suggest that restaurants have strong incentives to improve their online reviews and ratings .
Despite their widespread use , little is known about the dynamics of participation and of contributions by people in online recommendation sites . For example , would factors such as weather conditions , that are shown to influence mood and behavior , affect people ’s participation and recommendations ? Are restaurants from neighborhoods with high education levels more likely to receive reviews ? Are restaurants in highly populated urban neighborhoods more likely to be reviewed rather than restaurants in regions with lower population density ? What is the role , if any , of racial diversity in a restaurant ’s neighborhood in shaping online participation ?
Our insights could help consumers better understand online reviews and ratings , and aid review sites in calibrating recommendations . For example , exogenous factors may introduce systematic bias in online ratings of a highly reviewed restaurant in San Fransisco , compared to a similar restaurant in a rural area . Our study aims to understand such differences – what factors can influence the likelihood of being reviewed in a region ?
Three primary aspects of a restaurant are available to consumers via online reviews : user evaluation ( overall rating ) , user participation ( number of reviews , which also indicates popularity ) and the reviews themselves ( ie , the text and rating of each review ) . We study the effect of these aspects of three broad classes of factors : restaurant attributes , local demographics and local weather conditions at the date of visit . Our study is the first to look at exogenous factors and how they affect online ratings . We explain the importance of these classes and why we choose them in our related work .
1We use the term “ effect ” in this paper to refer to the statistical effect measured by regression , and not causality .
443 We study 840,000 restaurants spread across 32,402 cities and towns in the US . We collect over 1.1 million reviews and the corresponding ratings across these restaurants , spanning 10 years . We combine this with data on demographic information and daily weather conditions local to each restaurant . While this is certainly not an exhaustive compilation of factors , we show that the models presented here have significant explanatory power .
All told , we find the following :
• Restaurants that are marked online as “ low price ” tend to get fewer reviews and lower ratings . At the same time , online promotions are related with higher number of reviews , but not necessarily higher ratings .
• Specific features of a restaurant , such as having a bar might be associated with higher number of reviews but does not affect the ratings . The same relationship holds for restaurants that are featured via online advertisements .
• Service related factors such as delivery and carry out are strongly tied with the population density of the neigborhood , and the interplay of the two can influence the number of reviews and ratings .
• Restaurants that are in neighborhoods with higher population density and higher education levels are more likely to be reviewed . The education level does not seem to affect ratings . • Restaurants in some regions of United States ( eg Pacific and Northeast ) are more likely to receive reviews compared to other regions ( Midwest and South ) .
• There is a seasonal pattern among rating and reviews , showing lower ratings and higher number of reviews in months of July and August .
• Weather conditions are significantly associated with ratings . Reviews written on warm or cool days are more likely to be rated high than those written in cold or hot days . Reviews written on rainy or snowy days tend to have lower ratings than those written on days without rain or snow .
We perform conditional analyses on our data and show examples of online review text where feasible to substantiate our claims . Our study looks at the effect of several factors on online reviews , but at the same time , opens a number of research directions for future work . We discuss some of these towards the conclusion of the paper .
2 . RELATED WORK
There has been significant body of work that studied endogenous factors behind participation in online communities , and psychology of diners in the offline context . An interesting and not yet understood socio technical system that bridges both research areas is online restaurant recommendation sites . Our work complements online studies by being the first to do a large scale study of restaurant recommendation communities , and the first to look at effects of exogenous factors on ratings and reviews . Our work complements theories from experimental psychology by validating them in online communities . Online communities : Several research efforts studied the factors behind people ’s participation in online communities . These studies focused on factors that are endogenous to the online community and its members . Ridings et al . [ 44 ] studied various types of communities to understand why people participate in them . They report that participation is usually a factor of the community type ; and that the common reasons behind participation include information exchange , social support and friendship . Social loafing , a theory that shows the effect of group size on an individual ’s motivation to contribute [ 29 ] , has been observed in online communities [ 51 ] .

Researchers have looked at factors affecting participation in specific online communities . Lakhani and Wolf [ 32 ] studied contributors to Open Source Software ( OSS ) projects and found that career benefits and intellectual stimulation drive OSS community members to contribute to the projects . Nov studied motivations behind significant contributors to Wikipedia content [ 39 ] and found that having fun , learning and emotional aspects are significant drivers of contributions . Lampe et al . studied member participation in the Everything2 online encyclopedia [ 33 ] and found that a sense of belonging to the online community was a significant factor towards participation , while social interaction was not a strong motivator . To our knowledge , our work is the first to look at online restaurant recommendation communities which are highly popular . While prior work only considers endogenous predictors of online participation , we also consider exogenous predictors ( ie , factors not related to the community or its members ) , and we show that they play a role in community participation .
An integral part of an online recommendation community is reviews written by people . Researchers have analyzed review text and found some interesting features . Two prior studies have shown that review text has temporal correlation patterns [ 18 , 60 ] and gender differences [ 43 ] . David and Pinch found evidence of duplicate reviews between products [ 11 ] ; and Feng et al . found common patterns in deceptive reviews [ 16 ] . Certain patterns were also discovered among helpfulness evaluation of reviews [ 9 ] . Language analysis of review text showed a significant association between language features and sales [ 17 ] . A related research thread focuses on analysis of review text to identify and predict features : for example , identifying fake reviews , and summarizing and predicting product ratings [ 28 , 36 , 38 , 43 ] . In this work , we consider reviews and ratings as they are available to users on recommendation sites , since users make choices based on these reviews . Offline psychology : Consumers have many dining choices , and tend to consider many factors when making their decisions [ 55 ] . Traditionally , diners have traded recommendations using offline methods ( eg , word of mouth ) . In this context , there has been a significant effort in experimental psychology to understand , using inperson experiments , how people perceive dining and the effect of different factors . Our work shows that these observations of behavior in the offline world also hold true in online recommendation communities .
Experimental psychologists proposed theories of hedonic and utilitarian consumer experiences to understand the effect of prices , service and restaurant ambience on consumer behavior . For example , it has been shown that 91 % of consumers dissatisfied with service do not revisit a restaurant , and further , tell eight to ten others about their negative experience [ 42 ] . Studies [ 15 , 57 ] have found that consumers relate to ambience in an emotional ( hedonic ) terms , rather than cognitively . A similar effect of price was demonstrated by Wakefield et al . [ 58 ] .
Researchers have also studied the effect of promotions on consumers , which can be summarized into three classes of approaches . The first approach consists of analytical and empirical approaches
444 which studied the effects of the price change or incentives on aggregate metrics such as sales or market share . For example , a recent study found that online Groupon promotions can have a negative effect on subsequent online ratings [ 5 ] . The second approach looks at demographics of consumers who respond better to promotions [ 4 ] . The third approach studies psychological effect of promotions on consumers’ behavior [ 12 ] .
There has been work on consumers’ perceptions of quality , price and value [ 62 ] . The authors showed that consumers perceive quality and value as being similar . A study on the perception of food showed that food can be considered as a social concept , one that defines social status , based on the quality , cost and presentation of food [ 3 ] . Exogenous factors affecting mood and behavior . Psychologists have long known in the offline world that sunlight , and weather in general , influences people ’s moods , thinking and judgement [ 41 , 59 ] . Both seasonal and daily variations in weather have been documented to have effects on mood , depression and behavior [ 23 , 30 , 46 ] . In a study that manipulated temperature , Allen and Fischer [ 1 ] found that performance on a paired association memory task peaked at 72oF ( 22oC ) and declined with warmer or cooler temperature . Sinclair et al . [ 52 ] found that days that were sunny and warm were associated with more heuristic and less systematic processing than cloudy and cool days . In some studies , low levels of humidity [ 48 ] , high levels of sunlight [ 8 , 40 , 50 ] and high temperature [ 8 , 27 ] have been associated with high mood . However , high temperature has also been associated with low mood [ 20 ] and low potency ( low potency is similar to low mood [ 27] ) .
Changes result from physical characteristics of environment , often without the organism ’s awareness [ 45 ] . Cunnigham [ 8 ] found that weather also has an affect on helping behavior . In the study the weather was found to have an effect on the size of the tips that people left a waitress in a restaurant and the waitress ’s self reported mood . The study also suggested that sunshine levels affect mood through the symbolic connections it has with pleasant events . Therefore sunshine could increase a person ’s mood by stimulating thoughts of positive and pleasant activities such as swimming , outdoor outings/activities and picnics .
Weather and lunar cycles have been found to have an effect on stock market as well [ 14 , 19 , 25 , 34 , 49 , 56 , 61 ] . Saunders [ 49 ] shows that the NYSE rises more on sunny days in New York City , resulting in lower stock returns on cloudy days .
In addition to the outside weather , differences in the indoor lighting environment ( levels , spectral distribution , temporal patterns , etc . ) have been found to affect people in various ways . Daurat et al . [ 10 ] found that subjects reported a more positive mood under 2000 Lux compared to being under 300 Lux . Belcher and Kluczny [ 31 ] proposed a model in which mood , visual performance and decisionmaking strategy are affected by the visual environment and compete for mental processing capacity .
Demographics is an important factor in usage of the Internet [ 21 , 22 ] , and so it might affect the online behavior and level of activities . Our work builds on this research by looking for the first time at exogenous factors affecting the online reviews . We connect the anecdotal , experimental and theoretical studies of mood and behavior in psychology with the participation in online communities .
3 . DATASET
Figure 1 : Locations of weather stations in our data . We consider restaurants located within a 20 mile radius of each station . sufficient duration for formation of opinions via online reviews . We have a total of 840,000 restaurants across 32,402 towns/cities and 50 ( +DC ) states in United States , comprising a total of 1.1 million text reviews and ratings across the restaurants . Our data contains 46 dimensions which span the restaurant , demographics and weather classes . We expand on the data variables in subsections below . Note that our study is geographically limited to the US , since we have access to data for the region ; we leave a study across other geographic regions for future work .
Our data collection process is as follows . First , we mark ( possibly ) overlapping regions in US that have a radius of 20 miles . We choose the centers of these regions as the locations of 1,219 weather monitoring stations operated by the United States Historical Climatology Network ( USHCN ) . At a given time , we expect that the weather conditions are stationary in a 20 mile radius around each station . We note that weather monitoring stations are deployed in regions that contain a reasonable population ( and hence include a reasonable number of restaurants ) . Second , we find all restaurants that are located in each region of interest , and mine their attributes , reviews and ratings . Third , we mine demographic information in the neighborhood of each restaurant . Figure 1 shows the locations of weather stations in our data .
3.1 Restaurants and Reviews
We collect restaurant related data using the CityGrid API2 between 2002 and 2011 ( inclusive ) . The CityGrid database indexes up to date restaurant snapshots from several popular online business information and recommendation websites such as Citysearch , AllMenus , Foursquare , GrubHub , Demandforce , Factual , GoMobo , InfoUSA , SpaFinder and TripAdvisor . We extract restaurant data from CityGrid3 . Specifically , for each USHCN weather monitoring station , we find all restaurants located in a radius of 20 miles4 of the station . We ensure that each restaurant is associated with its nearest weather station . We collect data for 840,000 restaurants in 50 ( +DC ) states across United States . Large cities are divided into neighborhoods , giving us a total of 32,402 neighborhoods , towns and cities .
Restaurants . Each restaurant in our data contains several attributes of its online presence . These attributes can be divided into seven classes ; Table 1 gives examples in each class .
We consider three broad classes of variables : ( 1 ) control variables : restaurant attributes , including reviews and ratings ; ( 2 ) demographics near the restaurant ; and , ( 3 ) weather conditions at the time of visit , near the restaurant . Our data spans 2002 to 2011 ( inclusive ) . We do not consider data after 2011 , since we want to allow
2http://docscitygridmediacom/display/citygridv2/CityGrid+APIs 3We do not consider Yelp data in this study since the API does not give us sufficient variables for analysis . 4The restaurant location is specified as a latitude longitude pair , and we use the Haversine formula to compute distances .

Note that some of the data may not be available for a restaurant ; we mark such data as missing data . We pre process the dataset to exclude missing data , assuming that missing data occurs at random . Reviews . For each restaurant , we collect all available user reviews and ratings using the CityGrid API . Hence , each restaurant is associated with a number of reviews attribute , which quantifies online user participation for that restaurant . Each review is associated with a unique author ( online user ) , restaurant and timestamp tuple . For each review , we collect the complete review text and rating . The rating is an integer between 0 ( low ) and 10 ( high ) . We collect a total of 1.1 million reviews .
We post process the review text for each review to quantify the subjectivity ( between 0 and 1 ) and polarity ( between 1 and 1 ) of the text using the Pattern Toolkit [ 53 ] .
3.2 Demographics
We expect that demographics may have an impact on online reviews and ratings of a restaurant as it is an important factor in usage of the Internet [ 21 , 22 ] . For each restaurant , we collect four dimensions of demographics at the restaurant location ( latitude longitude or neighborhood ) as follows .
First , we collect the median income for residents in the location ( latitude longitude ) . We represent median income ( in USD ) as a categorical variable with five values : less than 25K , 25K 50K , 50K100K , 100K 200K and greater than 200K .
Second , we collect the education level for that location , defined as the fraction of residents who have a bachelors degree or higher . We use the US National Broadband Map5 for this purpose . We represent the education level as a categorical variable with the following values : less than 10 % , 10 25 % , 25 50 % and higher than 50 % . Third , we collect the diversity index for the city/town where each restaurant is located . The diversity index for an area is defined by the US Census Bureau as the probability ( on a scale of 0 1 ) that two randomly chosen people from the area will have different racial ( or Hispanic/non Hispanic ) backgrounds . We use the USA Today Census database 6 to collect diversity data . We represent diversity index as a categorical variable with values corresponding to : less than 0.3 , 03 05 , 05 07 and greater than 07
The fourth dimension of demographics data is the population density , defined as population of the neighborhood per square mile .
5http://wwwbroadbandmapgov/ 6http://developerusatodaycom/docs/read/Census
We define population as a categorical variable based on density , with intervals starting with densities 1000 , 2500 , 5000 and 10000 .
3.3 Weather Conditions
For each review for a restaurant , we collect several weather variables at the time of review . We choose weather related factors , since they have been shown to affect human behavior and mood [ 13 ] – and among others , retail sales [ 54 ] and the stock market [ 49 ] . We assume that the day when a review is written is representative of the day when the reviewer formed her opinions of the restaurant .
A restaurant is associated with a unique USHCN weather monitoring station . We collect data about weather conditions for each of the 1,219 weather monitoring stations in our dataset ( Figure 1 ) using the USHCN Daily Dataset [ 37 ] . The USHCN weather data is provided at the granularity of a day , which works well for our purpose .
We collect the following weather variables for each restaurant review : ( 1 ) the minimum temperature in Farenheit ( Tmin ) in the 24 hour period , ( 2 ) similarly , the maximum temperature ( Tmax ) , ( 3 ) precipitation in hundredth of inches , quantifying rainfall , and ( 4 ) snow in tenth of inches . Since Tmin and Tmax quantify extreme conditions that last for a small duration in the day , we process the temperature data to calculate a mean temperature estimate , ¯T = ( Tmin + Tmax)/2 , on the day of the review . We then categorize temperature into four buckets that describe better how humans perceive temperature : very cold ¯T ∈ [ 0 , 20 ] , cold ¯T ∈ ( 20 , 40 ] , cool ¯T ∈ ( 40 , 70 ] , warm ¯T ∈ ( 70 , 100 ] and hot ¯T > 100 . Unless otherwise mentioned , we measure temperature in degree Farenheit . We also categorize precipitation into three groups of no precipitation prcp = 0 , medium precipitation prcp ∈ ( 0 , 100 ] and high precipitation prcp > 100 . We process snow into a binary variable showing whether there was snow snow > 0 or there was no snow snow = 0 .
We use temperature , precipitation and snow to quantify weather conditions during a diner ’s restaurant visit . Distribution of quantitative variables are summarized in Table 2 .
4 . MODELING REVIEWS AND RATINGS

4.1 Modeling Reviews
The number of reviews is a count variable . We model number of reviews using negative binomial regression , on two classes of independent variables : restaurant attributes ( endogenous ) and local demographics ( exogenous ) . Negative binomial regression is wellsuited for overdispersed distributions of count dependent variable [ 6 ] . We use negative binomial regression instead of Poisson regression since the variance of the dependent variable is larger than the mean ( µ = 1.23 , σ = 519 ) We use overdispersion to test whether Poisson or negative binomial regression should be used . This test was suggested by Cameron and Trivedi [ 6 ] , and involves a simple leastsquares regression to test the statistical significance of the overdispersion coefficient .
The negative binomial regression models the expected number of reviews y for a restaurant as a function of endogenous and exogenous independent variables . We construct two regression models to evaluate the impact of endogenous and exogenous variables : first to model endogenous variables alone ( ed model ) , and the second to model both exogenous and endogenous variables ( ed+ex model ) . The reduction in deviance from the full model to the endogenousonly model shows the significance of exogenous variables on explaining the number of reviews .
The first model uses restaurant attributes ( endogenous variables ed ) as predictors of the number of reviews a restaurant receives . ln(y ) = I + Σxi ∈ed i
βixi
( 1 ) where I is the intercept for the model and the endogenous sum is computed using the following restaurant related attributes :
Σxi ∈ed i
βixi = βpricexprice + βof f ers ∗ xof f ers + βbar ∗ xbar +βdelivery ∗ xdelivery + βcarryoutxcarryout +βmealxmeal + βf eatured ∗ xf eatured
( 2 )
This model allows us to understand the effect on the number of reviews of endogenous variables alone .
We then model the impact of exogenous factors ( local weather and demographics ) on the number of reviews as follows . We construct a second model that includes both restaurant attributes and exogenous attributes as predictors . We also include predictors for the interaction between some pairs of the independent variables . ln(y ) = I + Σxi ∈ed i
βixi + Σ xj ∈ex j
βj xj
( 3 ) where , the endogenous sum is taken from equation 2 and exogenous sum is computed using demographics variables and interaction between endogenous and demographic variables :
Σ xj ∈ex j
βj xj = βregionxregion + βpopxpop + βincomexincome
+βeduxedu + βdiversityxdiversity +βcarryout∗popxcarryoutxpop + βdelivery∗popxdeliveryxpop
( 4 )
Here , xpop is the categorical variable for population density and xedu is the catgeorical variable representing ranges of percentage of population in the neighborhood with higher education .
The regression coefficients β allow us to understand the effect of an independent variable on the number of reviews ( note that to be able to compare coefficients , we z score all numerical variables before performing regression ) .
In order to choose which subset of independent variables should be included in the number of reviews model , we use the Akaike Information Criterion ( AIC ) . AIC is a measure of the relative quality of one model against another , and is defined as following :
AIC = −2L + 2k where , k is the number of parameters and L is the maximum loglikelihood of the model . The smaller the value of AIC , the better the fit of the model . Starting with a full set of independent variables listed in the data section , and all possible interactions of those , we use a step wise procedure to select the model that minimizes AIC . Using the model with minimum AIC also reduces the chances of choosing a model that overfits the data .
We test coefficients of all independent variables for the null hypothesis of a zero valued coefficient ( two sided ) . This method is based on standard errors of coefficients , which is analogous to the ttest used in conventional regression analyses . We use a Chi squared test with one degree of freedom to test the hypothesis that each coefficient βj is zero . To do this , we compute the following term :
χ2 = b2 j
( SEj )2 where , bj is the estimate of βj and SEj is the standard error of the coefficient βj . Table 6 shows the β coefficients and the p values from the Chi squared test . We see that almost all independent variables ( and interaction variables ) have coefficients that are statistically significant .
We use the deviance goodness of fit test to assess our regression fit [ 24 ] . The deviance is expressed as :
D = 2 n
X i=1
( ζ(yi ; yi ) − ζ(µi ; yi ) ) with ζ(yi ; yi ) indicating a log likelihood function with every value of µ given the value y in its place . The ζ(µi ; yi ) is the log likelihood function for the model being estimated .
The deviance is a comparative statistic . We use the Chi square test to find the significance of the regression model , with the value of deviance and the degrees of freedom as two Chi square parameters . The degrees of freedom is the number of predictors in each model . Table 3 summarizes the model parameters and the goodness of fit test results , showing that the regression models are a good fit for our data .
447 4.2 Modeling Ratings
Users specify ratings as an integer on a scale of 0 to 10 . We model ratings using a cumulative link model , also known as ordered logistic regression [ 26 ] on the endogenous and exogenous independent variables for a review ( restaurant attributes , demographics and weather conditions ) , since the model is well suited for ordinal dependent variables and dichotomous dependent variables .
A cumulative link model is a model for an ordinal response variable , Yi that can fall in j = 1 , , J categories . Then Yi follows a multinomial distribution with parameter π where πij denotes the probability that the i’th observation falls in response category j . We can write the cumulative probabilities as follows :
γij = P ( Yi ≤ j ) = πi1 + + πij
The logit function is defined as logit(π ) = log( π tive logits follow :
1−π ) and cumula logit(γij ) = log
P ( Yj ≤ j )
1 − P ( Yi ≤ j )
, j = 1 , , J − 1
( 5 )
Note that the cumulative logits are defined for all but the last category . A cumulative link model with a logit link is a regression model for cumulative logits : logit(γij ) = θj − xT i β where xi is a vector of independent variables for the i’th observation and β is the corresponding vector of regression coefficients . The θj variables provide the j’th cumulative logit with its own intercept . A key point is that the regression part xT i β is independent of j , so β has the same effect for each of the J − 1 cumulative logits .
The regression coefficients β allow us to understand the effect of an independent variable on the rating ( we scale numeric variables as before ) . Most of the weather related distributions ( see Table 2 ) have a heavy tail ; we hence consider the logarithm and scale for zero mean before using as input to regression .
In order to understand the effect of exogenous variables on ratings , we build two models for ratings , along the lines of the models for number of reviews . These include logit regression to model effect of endogenous variables ( ed model ) , and a logit regression to model the effect of both endogenous and exogenous variables ( ed+ex model ) . For each model , we choose the set of independent variables that give us a statistical model with the lowest AIC value . Similar to the reviews model , we use deviance to test for the goodness of fit of the ratings regression models . The deviance asymptotically follows as χ2 distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of predictors in each model . We use the Chi square test to find the significance of the regression model , as before . Table 4 summarizes the model parameters and their significance , showing that the regression models are a good fit for our data .
5 . EFFECT OF RESTAURANT ATTRIBUTES
( ENDOGENOUS )
The first class of variables we study are our control variables , ie , restaurant attributes . In particular , we look at the effect of monetary attributes , atmosphere , service and online advertising on recommendations . Understanding the effect of endogenous factors is a critical part of this work , since such a study provides a framework for evaluating the effects of exogenous factors .
Table 6 summarizes the regression coefficients β of the negative binomial and cumulative link models with and without the exogenous variables ( both ed and ed+ex models ) . The models’ significance is summarized in Tables 3 and 4 .
We choose a subset of restaurant attributes that we expect would not have collinearity between them based on observations from the data . For example , we find that the restaurant type “ steak and seafood ” is correlated with the higher price range , while “ hamburger joints ” are correlated with lower price range . This is also the case with dining type ; for example , the “ cheap eats ” and “ fine dining ” types are not independent of price range . Hence , when we talk about effect of price range , we control for restaurant and dining types as well . In our model , we do not consider other restaurant attributes such as cuisine and ambience , since we find that the price range is generally correlated with these variables in our dataset ; hence , price range could be treated as representative of these variables .
Next , we look at the effect of different endogenous variables on user reviews and ratings . Price range . Price range is characterized using a scale of four in websites : “ $ ” ( low ) to “ $$$$ ” ( high ) . Our regression model for both number of reviews and ratings consider the lowest price range ( $ ) as the reference to evaluate effect of each category on number of reviews and ratings . The results show that the higher price range restaurants are more likely to be reviewed by online users and they are more likely to receive higher ratings . For example the restaurants with price range “ $$$$ ” receive on average 10.9 times more reviews than the restaurants of price range “ $ ” ( β$$$$ = 2.39 , IRR = 1097 ) We see similar effect for the other two price ranges : for “ $$$ ” β = 2.19 , IRR = 8.93 , and for “ $$ ” β = 1.77 , IRR = 587
One reason for the low number of reviews for “ $ ” compared to the higher price ranges could be that diners do not look for a complete dining experience in low priced restaurants , and this may mean a lower propensity to spend time reviewing online . The dining atmosphere , which makes for a more complete experience , is correlated with the price range – suggesting that “ $ ” restaurants may be focused towards quick or self service and not a complete dining experience . We found in our data that more than 95 % of the quick serve and family dining restaurants have a price range “ $ ” .
Our observations confirm market research studies by Wakefield et al . [ 58 ] who found that consumers become less sensitive to prices when they are looking for a hedonic experience ( as opposed to functional experience ) . For example , a diner of a “ $$$$ ” restaurant admits in the review that although the place is expensive , the dining experience is enjoyable :
“ Yes it is expensive , but we enjoy eating here . Great service , great food and a very nice wine list with something for everyone . ” ( Rating : 10/10 )
The strong effect of restaurant price which is correlated with ambience may be explained by experimental psychology . Ambience is related to consumers’ hedonic experiences ( fantasy and emotional aspects ) of dining . Wakefield and Blodgett found that consumers look for hedonic consumption to experience pleasure and excitement [ 58 ] . The “ Servicescape ” theory [ 15 , 57 ] argues that hedonic purposes are more involved than utilitarian ( functional ) purpose in consumers . Research shows that the degree of pleasure that consumers experience in a hedonic consumption has a significant effect on their degree of satisfaction and subsequent behavior [ 35 , 47 ] . For example , celebrating a special occasion may have a strong hedonic purpose , and hence , the dining perception is likely to be
7We use IRR to refer to Incidence Rate Ratio . We compute IRR for a categorical independent variables x as the ratio of amount of change in the dependent variable ( outcome ) for x relative to a reference level of x .

Table 6 : Regression coefficients and their statistical significance for both models describing the ratings .
( β between 0.20 and 039 ) Restaurants in regions with density between 1000 and 2500 have the largest number of reviews while regions with lower population densities ( less than 1000 ) are the ones with fewer number of reviews . Restaurants in the most dense areas ( > 10000 ) , however , do not get the highest number of reviews . The effect of population is not as large as some other demographic factors such as education , which we will discuss later .
The effect of population on rating is small and negligible ; in other words , the higher populated areas do not necessarily impact the ratings of restaurants in the neighborhood .
We also look at interaction effects between endogenous service factors ( carryout and delivery ) and the ( exogenous ) neighborhood population . We find that regions with higher population and availability of delivery service have higher chances of being reviewed ( βdelivery∗pop>10000 = 0.7 , IRR = 20 ) Restaurants in regions with population density between 1000 and 10000 are likely to be rated lower than those in low density regions ( less than 1000 ) and high density regions ( greater than 10000 ) . The effect on ratings of interaction between the carryout attribute and local population is relatively more significant .

Table 5 : Regression coefficients and their statistical significance for both models describing the number of reviews . The reference category refers to the category of the variable that each factor was compared against . For the interaction predictors , the reference can be determined by using the reference category of each of the variables .
We consider three demographics dimensions in our study ; these dimensions are categorical variables defined over a geographic region such as a city or town ( for larger cities we consider neighborhoods as a unit of geography ) : ( 1 ) population density ( per square mile ) , ( 2 ) education level , ( 3 ) diversity index . We also considered median income ( dollars ) in initial models , but the predictor did show any significance and was suggested inefficient by the model . Hence we removed income as a predictor to both models . Education level is defined as the fraction of population who have a bachelor degree or higher in the region . Diversity index ( or “ diversity ” ) is defined by the US Census Bureau as the probability that two randomly selected people from the region have different racial or Hispanic/non Hispanic backgrounds .
Population . We begin with the question : Does population density in the region of a restaurant shape the online review participation and ratings ?
We represent population density as a categorical variable in our model ( with buckets starting at 0 , 1000 , 2500 , 5000 and 10000 ) . We use the first bucket ( 0 1000 ) as a reference category . Hence , all β coefficients are compared against the reference category .
We see from our regression models that the effect of neighborhood population on number of reviews is positive but not too large

Figure 3 : Effect of demographics : controlled analyses showing distribution of number of reviews for pairs of restaurants in neighborhoods having similar population densities but highly dissimilar education and diversity levels . We control for population since it has a strong effect on the number of reviews . ryout service that are located in neighborhoods with density greater than 10000 : they are more highly rated than restaurants in other regions . This finding emphasizes on importance of studying the interplay between endogenous and demographic factors .
Region . We group states of US into five geographical regions : Midwest , South , Northeast , Mountain and Pacific , based on census bureau designated areas . Note that this variable would not be correlated with restaurant local demographics and weather variables , since it captures relatively coarse grained region effects . We estimate the effect of regional properties on reviews and ratings . We use Midwest as our reference region category . Our results show that region plays a role in explaining the variance in number of reviews . Restaurants in the Pacific region are 1.8 times more likely ( β = 0.60 , IRR = 1.82 ) to receive reviews compared to the ones in Midwest . On the other hand , while Mountain and Northeast regions are more likely to receive reviews compared to Midwest , the South region is relatively less likely . When it comes to ratings , however , we find that regions have a negligible effect on ratings .
Education . We see that region has a relationship with number of reviews . What factors in a region are behind these effects ? We find that education shows a strong positive effect on the number of reviews . More specifically , neighborhoods with high percentage of college degrees ( greater than 50 % ) are highly likely to have restaurants with high number of reviews . The reference category for education is neighborhoods with percentage of higher education less than 10 % . Neighborhoods with highly educated residents receive 2.78 times more reviews ( β = 1.02 , IRR = 278 ) Neighborhoods with 10 25 % higher degree penetration ( β = 0.31 , IRR ) and 25 50 % penetration ( β = 0.18 , IRR ) are more likely to receive reviews than neighborhoods with less than 10 % of highereducated population . In general , the higher the education level in a region , the higher are the chances of restaurants in that region being reviewed online . Higher education level , however , has relatively lesser effect on ratings .
Racial diversity . Another demographic factor we considered in our study is the role of racial diversity ( as defined by the US Census Bureau ) . We divide regions into four categories in terms of diversity , and use the lowest diversity category as our reference . We find that medium diversity positively impacts the number of reviews ( βdiversity∈(0.3,05 ) = 0.13 , IRR = 1.14 and βdiversity∈(05,07 ) = 0.18 , IRR = 1.20 ) ; while the effect of high diversity is less than the effect for reference category . We do not see significant effect of diversity on ratings .
Weather . Weather conditions at the time of review are an attribute of a review . Hence , we can only test the effects of weather on ratings . Our results show that in all cases of precipitation greater

Figure 4 : Confidence intervals for average ratings in a month . than 0 ( rainy days ) the rating is affected negatively . This is inline with previous studies showing sunshine having positive affect on mood while cloudy weather having negative affect [ 8 , 40 , 50 ] . Specifically , we find that when it rains but the precipitation is less than 100 , users rate restaurants lower than when it does not rain ( β = −032 ) When precipitation is greater than 100 , the same relationship holds ( β = −034 )
For temperature we use the the very cold category ( 0 20◦F ) as the reference category . We find that when the temperature is in the 20 100◦F range , it positively affects the rating ( βtemp∈(20,40 ) = 0.29 , βtemp∈(40,70 ) = 0.34 , βtemp∈(70,100 ) = 0.54 ) ; but at high temperatures ( over 100◦F ) , the ratings given by users are lower than the reference category ratings ( βtemp>100 = −018 ) In other words , the ratings for a restaurant when the user visited it in moderate ( cold , cool and warm ) weather conditions are likely to be higher than ratings when the visit was during very cold or very hot weather . Users tend to give the highest ratings when the weather is warm ( between 70 100◦F ) . A related study by Allen and Fischer [ 1 ] found that temperature can affect humans in particular , performance on a paired association memory task peaked at 72◦F ( 22◦C ) and declined with warmer or cooler temperature .
During days when it snows ( snow is a binary variable ) , we see that users rate restaurants lower than other days ( β = −023 ) Note that the binary snow variable is not necessarily correlated with temperature ; hence , we can use the two variables as predictors in our model .
Seasonal trends . Taking a closer look at the data , we find two interesting temporal patterns of online reviews ( see Figure 4 ) . First , we find that the number of reviews as well as ratings change with the month of the year ( across 2002 to 2011 ) . Specifically , diners tend to give lower ratings to restaurants in the Summer months of July and August . We also find that the number of reviews shows an opposite trend , increasing in the months of Summer ( June , July and August ) and a month in Fall ( November ) .
7 . DISCUSSION
Restaurant goers are increasingly using and relying on social recommendation communities to make their dining choices . Understanding the dynamics of participation on social recommendation sites is vital to improving such services , and to calibrate recommendations . Prior research has focused on endogenous factors , which are based on the recommendation community and its users . In this paper , we augment prior work by studying the effects of exogenous factors and comparing them with endogenous factors .
451 Our findings show that exogenous factors affect user behavior , and highlight the importance of exogenous factors in recommendation systems . This could be a foundation for understanding how people recommend businesses on online communities , and what factors influence these recommendations .
In ths work , we take a holistic view of online recommendations of restaurants by considering several endogenous and exogenous factors that can play a role . We showed that several endogenous factors related to restaurants influence how users review and rate the restaurants online . We found that the price bracket in which a restaurant operates , the type of meal it offers , and the nature of service have a significant correlation with how strongly the restaurant is recommended ( or not ) online .
Our work is the first to show that exogenous factors such as demographics of a restaurant ’s neighborhood and weather conditions at the time of the review , can play an important role in online recommendations for that restaurant . We found that restaurants located in neighborhoods with higher education levels are much more likely to receive reviews . We also found that weather conditions when a user reviews a restaurant can play a role in the user ’s online recommendation . We saw that reviews written in warm days are more likely to be higher rated relative to more extreme temperature conditions . We found that reviews written on non rainy days and non snowy days are higher rated than those written on rainy and snowy days . We controlled for all restaurant and demographicsrelated factors in our analysis .
We also showed that certain endogenous and exogenous factors are inter related . For example , service related factors such as delivery and carryout are inter related with population density ; and their impact is better understood when the neighborhood demographics are taken into account .
We believe that this is only an initial step , and that there is a rich landscape of research directions and open questions in this area . Our findings have implications for the design of recommendation systems . Recommendation sites can account for , and correct bias , that is systematically related to demographics and weather . For example , a restaurant with N reviews in New York City may not describe the same popularity as one with N reviews in a small suburban area . Limitations and Future Work . Our work is purely quantitative and based on observations we had from data . Our approach is useful in describing what factors affect restaurant reviews and ratings , but without a corresponding qualitative approach , we can only speculate on why these factors matter . Further , the statistical methods we used examine only a small segment of what is available on the review sites ( for example , a large scale analysis of review text can complement our work ) .
Future work can establish models to further understand impact . First , we note that our analysis does not necessarily establish causality between all of these dimensions and reviews or ratings . Second , modeling dynamics of interaction on social recommendation sites may highlight aspects of how particular restaurants become popular on recommendation sites . Third , what if and how to models are useful to predict online reviews and ratings in new scenarios and to help business owners understand how to improve ( or correct ) ratings of their restaurants . Finally , models similar to the ones in our study can be built for other review sites or online communities . For example , the CityGrid database indexes data about shopping . Open questions . There are some interesting questions that can be answered with the dataset . First , we have not looked at the effect of culture on online ratings of restaurants . Can we validate our models for online recommendations in other geographic areas ? Second , a fine grained demographics analysis of ratings is neces sary to understand how users rate online , and how a particular user demographic perceives different restaurants ( as opposed to demographics of the restaurant neighborhood ) . This would require demographic data about online reviewers ( or inference of such dimensions from available information ) . Third , we have shown some interesting but preliminary visualizations of time trends among ratings and reviews . Additional work is required to understand these trends . We are happy to share our rich dataset8 with the community for future work .
8 . CONCLUSION
Online recommendation sites are important sources of information for people to choose restaurants . In this work , we take a first look at online restaurant recommendation sites to study what endogenous ( ie , related to either the community , its members or entities being reviewed ) and exogenous factors influence people ’s participation and their recommendations . Online participation and recommendations have been modeled in general as functions of endogenous factors . Using models constructed from a corpus of 840K restaurants and their 1.1M associated reviews , we find that while endogenous factors such as restaurant attributes ( eg , price and service ) affect recommendations , surprisingly , exogenous factors such as demographics ( eg , neighborhood diversity , education ) and weather ( temperature , precipitation , snow , season ) also exert a significant effect on recommendations . Many of these online effects can be explained using ( offline ) theories from experimental psychology . Our work has implications for online recommendation systems design ; for example how online communities could calibrate recommendations or project reviews for new restaurants with few reviews .
