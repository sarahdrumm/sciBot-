ABSTRACT WikiNEXT is a wiki engine 100 % written in JavaScript that relies on recent APIs and frameworks . It has been designed to author web applications directly in a web browser , which can exploit the web of data . It combines the functionalities of a semantic wiki with those of a Web based IDE ( Integrated Development Environment ) in order to develop web applications to writing classic documents . It gives developers a rich internal API ( Application Programming Interface ) and provides several functionalities to exploit the web of data . Our approach uses templates , a special type of wiki pages that represent the semantic data model . Templates generate wiki pages with semantic annotations that are stored as quadruplets in a triple store engine . To query this semantic data , we provide a SPARQL endpoint . Screencasts are available on YouTube ( look for WikiNEXT ) . Categories and Subject Descriptors K43 [ Organizational Impacts ] : Computer supported collaborative work . Keywords Semantic Web , Web2.0 , Wikis , Semantic Wikis , Knowledge Management , Web Applications 1 . INTRODUCTION The wiki concept was introduced in 1995 by Ward Cunningham . Today many projects such as Wikipedia ’s MediaWiki1 engine are based on it . MediaWiki is an example of a wiki engine to do the publication of articles . It is extensible by plugins and extensions which must be installed server side . Later , wikis became very popular as enterprise knowledge management systems ; this has led to another , more complex class of wiki engines . In these wiki engines such as Confluence2 , Mindtouch3 , TWiki[6 ] , XWiki[5 ] or SharePoint4 , users can integrate widgets or macros into the wiki . At the same time , semantic wikis , such as Semantic MediaWiki[1 ] , MoKi[4 ] , OntoWiki[3 ] and IkeWiki[2 ] have enabled wikis to be enhanced with semantic information . Some of these wiki engines are only research experiments . Semantic wikis tend to use one of two approaches , using the wiki either as a data model or to support structured data modeling .

Recently , it has become possible to use IDEs in a web browser . Some lightweight online IDEs are well known by web developers , including Cloud95 , Nitrous.IO , jsfiddle.com , and jsbincom Cloud9 and Nitrous.IO are examples of Web based IDEs that support a range of product development features . They support version control for source code , collaborative development for multiple users , as well as debug and run mode for a project . Meanwhile , jsfiddle.com and jsbin.com are examples of code sharing services . In these services , developers can both write HTML/CSS/JavaScript code and share it . They are designed to share a piece of code or a single page web application without a server side part . This paper presents WikiNEXT6 , which combines the features of a semantic wiki and a web based IDE , to support developers of web applications that exploit the web of data . In section 2 we will explain how the spread of Linked data has led to increasingly more advanced web applications that use different underlying semantic models . Section 3 introduces WikiNEXT as part of a new trend of using a wiki as a development tool and shows the difference with classic wikis . 2 . WEB APPLICATION AND WIKIS Although Semantic Web technologies have been around for a while , they have had little impact on the development of Web applications . With significant quantities of Linked Data being published on the Web , numerous efforts are underway to build applications that exploit this Web of Data . This has created a challenging environment for exploiting and modeling the knowledge pipeline . In the Conventional Model , a Web application is composed of three clearly separated major components , namely the Web browser , the Web server and the backend storage system ( eg , a database ) . Other models have extended the Conventional Model with extra clientside control of data or computation . For example , Wikipedia articles are collaboratively maintained by users and complex wiki templates are frequently used to enable advanced page layout . A user may also call extensions of a wiki platform ( eg , “ parser functions ” in MediaWiki ) to perform certain computation tasks such as string processing , mathematical computation and visualization . The MediaWiki engine and its successors such as MindTouch largely use this approach . Also note that a wiki page may embed script languages ( eg Velocity and Groovy in XWiki7 ) for advanced tasks , which allow the API to run in page applications or macros . 3 . WIKI AS A DEVELOPMENT TOOL Wikis , web based collaborative authoring tools , have been used in other areas , such as for course management or specific activities in the software development process , such as code reviewing , bug

599 tracking , and functional testing . However , wikis , or wiki like tools have not been widely used for programming purposes . Our application , WikiNEXT8 , a wiki/web based IDE , is used for developing web applications that exploit the Linked Data ( LD ) . It provides two editors : a HTML editor and a JavaScript editor that can be used in development mode for advanced users . Development mode offers the opportunity to create powerful and dynamic applications through the web browser . Wiki pages , in this environment , are considered as web applications . The life cycle of wiki pages that embed application code is considerably more complicated than that of classic wiki pages . The lifecycle of a classic wiki page is shown in Figure 1 .
“ template ” page also allows variables to be used as input parameters . Template wiki pages can be reused later in the same wiki page for displaying or processing data . Templates can also be used for modeling structured data and generating semantic data . By aggregating the data management and data processing features with JavaScript , we can design interactive , visualized interfaces to manipulate semantically enriched data . In a WikiNEXT application , many elements can be constructed using the HTML editor . Utilizing templates permits the data to be presented with various visual elements ( eg , tables , graphs and trees ) .
Figure 1 : The lifecycle of a classic wiki page
This is different from the lifecycle of program development in a web based IDE ( see Figure 2 ) . Since a wiki page is an application in WikiNEXT , developing an application and editing a wiki page are the same process .
Figure 2 : Life cycle of a program development
Therefore , the “ deploy ” and “ run ” stages are implicit steps that occur when a page is saved and rendered . We think that this environment is well suited for retrieving , combining and reusing multiple sources available in the web of data . The main problem for development in wikis is how to store the data . Existing wiki engines require access to the wiki database or an external data store . We propose using semantic annotations integrated into wiki pages for storing application data . In the next section we introduce the WikiNEXT Data Model and describe how it can be used to model structured data and generate semantic metadata .
4 . WikiNEXT Data Model Semantic wikis enrich conventional wikis by allowing users to edit and query structured semantic annotations , not just plain wiki text . This enables a novel , transparent , and light weight social Web application model , which lets developers collectively build Web applications . Thus , semantic wikis can be used for data modeling , data management , data processing and data presentation . We were inspired from this trend to develop our model . Unlike other semantic wikis ( eg Semantic MediaWiki ) that use extensions to support some data processing abilities , WikiNext uses JavaScript as a scripting language to create and query about structured annotations . A special type of wiki page called a

The metadata generated by applications embedded in WikiNEXT pages is also represented in the page as RDFa/RDFa lite9 annotations . For example , a list of countries resulting from a request or a web services call to DBPedia.org , can be reused in the page . WikiNEXT parses these annotations and saves them in a modified version of RDFStore js , which supports SPARQL 11 The traditional page content is stored as a JSON objects in a MongoDB10 database .
To understand how templates work for both data visualization and semantic data generation , we now describe a WikiNEXT based Web application the general methodology described above . that exemplifies
Several WikiNEXT based Web applications have advanced User Interfaces ; for example , the City application11 for city searching and annotation is shown in Figure 3 . In this application , in order to create structured data about cities we retrieve data from DBPedia.fr and we create wiki pages with Web of data compliant data . Below is a simplified example of a template used in the City application . <span about={{_id}} typeof= ” City ” > <h1 property= ” name ” >{{city}}</h1> </span> In the code above we define an object with an identifier “ {{_id}} ” which vocabulary http://schemaorg/City This vocabulary states that a City has a has RDF
“ City ” , type from the

600 Figure 4 : Difference between default rendering ( on the left ) and template based rendering ( on the right ) property “ name ” , and we will give it the value “ {{city}} ” . WikiNEXT uses the Mustache12 template engine on the client side , and this syntax comes from the template engine . The JavaScript code below fills the template with real values : var pagedata = {} ; pagedata.city = city ; // dbpedia result article = wikinextHelper.city(pagedata ) ; Figure 4 illustrates the difference between the default rendering and template based rendering of a query result . The template based result page on Figure 4 on the right is augmented with semantic data and can be queried by other web applications . The semantic metadata of this page is shown in Figure 5 . This data is accessible through the SPARQL endpoint for the wiki applications or external use .
5 . CONCLUSION WikiNEXT allows users to create web applications that use linked data via simple access through a web browser . The demo version is available online . We also conducted several usability tests . The protocol we used , as well as detailed results of this evaluation are available in WikiNEXT pages online , and show that WikiNEXT saves time , compared to traditional programming using a Dekstop IDE , for writing applications that query the web of data . 6 .
