ABSTRACT Recent advances of social TV services allow sports fans to watch sports games at any place and to lively interact with other fans via online chatting . Despite their popularity , however , so far little is known about the key properties of such mass interactions in online sports viewing . In this paper , we explore motives for mass interactions in online sports viewing and investigate how the motives are related to viewing and chatting behaviors , by studying Naver Sports , the largest online sports viewing service in Korea . Categories and Subject Descriptors H53 [ Group and Organization Interfaces ] : Synchronous Interaction Keywords Online Sports Viewing , Mass Interactions , Sports Fan , Social TV 1 . INTRODUCTION Nowadays , sports fans now can watch sports games at any place using social TV services such as YouTube Live , MLB TV , Naver Sports TV , lively interacting with other fans via online chatting ; eg , cheering their favorite teams in the workplace or the commuting bus . Social TV services provide unique viewing experiences in that viewers have a similar degree of freedom like home viewing and can share and affirm their fanship with many other online viewers . Live chatting behavior in social TV can be considered as mass interactions in that a large number of online viewers have a single public space for cheering their favorite teams , expressing their feelings , and even asking/answering questions . However , our knowledge about the nature of mass interactions in online sports viewing is still limited . Prior works on mediated sports are limited to social experiences in offline setting like sports bars [ 1 ] . The goal of this paper is to deepen our understanding on mass interactions in online sports viewing and to identify practical implications for social TV system design . To this end , we have the following research questions : ( 1 ) What are the major motives of engaging in mass interactions while viewing online sports ? and ( 2 ) How are these motives related with the usage characteristics ( physical/social context , chatting patterns ) ? We answer these questions by analyzing 6.5 million chat messages from Naver Sports , the most popular live streaming service for sports game in Korea . We supplement a large scale data analysis the data analysis with a survey study with 1,123 Naver Sports users . 2 . MOTIVES FOR MASS INTERACTION To study motives of mass interaction in social TV environments , we adopt the Use and Gratification approach [ 3 ] , a theoretical framework that examines ‘how’ and ‘why’ of media use .

ACM 978 1 4503 2745 9/14/04 . http://dxdoiorg/101145/25679482577340 explore motives for mass interaction in online sports viewing and develop a scale to measure them . Then , we investigate how usage motives are related to actual usage behavior via a series of multiple linear regression analysis . 2.1 Identifying Motives for Mass Interaction in Online Sports Viewing We use a two stage process of identifying motives , which is typically used in existing UGT work . In the first stage , we conduct an exploratory study to find users’ motives , eg , by soliciting answers in free text format like previous UGT work [ 2 ] . Sixty Naver Sports users responded our surveys . Two raters then worked collaboratively to perform affinity diagramming to extract main themes of motives from the participants’ response data . As the results , five main themes were emerged as outlined : sharing feelings & thoughts , membership , information sharing , fun and entertainment , and emotional release . In the subsequent stage , we perform a large scale survey and conduct an exploratory factor analysis that groups relevant survey items , deriving statistically significant motives . We prepared 26 survey items to measure motives based on the response data in the exploratory study . Participants are asked to rate each of the items on a 7 point Likert scale . In addition , the survey content includes several questions about their chatting and viewing behaviors . Total 1,123 users responded to the survey .

Emotional release
Example item I want to know how others respond to my chat messages about feelings and thoughts .
Motive Sharing feelings & thoughts Fun & entertainment Chatting is fun and enjoyable itself . Information offering Information sharing
I can answer to others’ questions . I can ask questions about something I do not know while watching a game . I can express my excitement in writing just as I were shouting in a stadium . Fans can be united by cheering their teams and favorite players together . I want to boo the opposing team , and its fans
Intra membership Inter membership
We conducted exploratory factor analysis on the survey responses on the 26 questions about motives . We identified seven factors that explain 69.32 % of the variance . To identify key items for each component , we eliminated the items which have a lower factor loading value and does not affect the reliability of the factor seriously . Based on the selected items , we named each component as follows : sharing feelings & thoughts ( 7 items , α = 0.871 ) , fun and entertainment ( 4 items , α = 0.788 ) , information offering ( 3 items , α = 0.872 ) , information seeking ( 3 items , α = 0.874 ) , emotional release ( 3 items , α = 0.767 ) , intra membership ( 3 items , α = 0.811 ) , and inter membership ( 3 items , α = 0716 ) Table 1 shows an example item of each motive . It is interesting to note that building interpersonal relationship is not identified as a key motive . In earlier work on social TV , this
329 motive is commonly observed [ 4 ] . We posit that this characteristic is attributed to the fact that a large number of “ strangers ” are participating in a chat session , which is the main difference from earlier work in which small group based user studies are assumed . Users would identify themselves as fans ( membership ) , and yet due to massive number of participants , mass chat may not facilitate interpersonal relationship building . 2.2 Relationships between Motives and Usage of Online Sports Viewing System We study how usage characteristics are related to the motives through multiple regression analysis . Dependent variables are the seven motive scores ( ie , for each motive , its score is the mean of all the ratings ) . Usage characteristics as independent variables are classified into three types : demographics , viewing behavior , and chatting behavior . The values of these types are measured by analyzing the survey results and the chat messages in Naver Sports . Table 2 shows significant results of the analysis . Table 2 .

Among demographic variables , Age and Gender showed significant relationship with some motives . Sharing feelings & thoughts , Entertainment , and Emotional release were positively correlated with Age . Sharing thoughts and Entertainment were negatively correlated with Gender , meaning that males may be more motivated by these motives than females . In addition , gender was positively correlated with the information offering , pointing that males more like to offer information to others . Several usage patterns significantly reflect users’ motives for enjoying mass interaction . Checking chats emerges as the strongest predictor of all the motives . Intuitively , viewing the chat screen frequently represents the strong motives of enjoying participating in chatting with others . The sharing feelings & thoughts is positively associated with multitasking and use of smart devices for viewing . This indicates that users having this motive desire to check others’ responses occasionally while they do other works simultaneously , or to compensate lack of interaction affordances in smart devices via chatting functions . The fanship ( representing a tendency that a user chats to only a few of teams ) is also negatively correlated with this motive , indicating that those users tend to chat while watching games among diverse teams .
The entertainment motive was negatively correlated with the multitasking and the fanship and positively correlated with the frequency of online sports viewing and the amount of chats . This possibly means that the users with high entertainment motive may want to spend their extra time for watching sports games ; not only their favorite teams , but also other teams . Indeed , our data shows that they tend to post short , positive messages and to frequently respond to amusing chat messages using simple emotional expressions such as emoticons . Predictors of the emotional release motive were similar to those of the sharing feelings & thoughts and entertainment . Like the entertainment motive , the emotional release was negatively associated with the length of chat messages , perhaps relating to the frequent use of simple interjections and emoticons . Information offering and seeking motives were positively associated with the number of chats . Users who frequently participate in message exchanges with others more likely perceive chats as useful source of information . Also , reporting abusive users was positively correlated with both motives , representing their efforts to develop a better communication environment for information sharing . There are other significant variables for predicting information offering and seeking motives . Information offering is negatively correlated with fan ship , meaning that informative users tend to watch sports games of many teams rather than focusing on favorite teams . Information seeking was positively correlated with the use of smart devices for viewing . While watching sports game on smart devices , the chat room would be the most convenient information source . Thus , the smart device viewers would value the usefulness of chats for information seeking . Also , information seeking was negatively related to the length of chats . Questions are short in length as watchers have a good shared context . The membership related motives were significantly related to the behaviors reflecting fanship and group affiliation [ 3 ] . Those who have these motives tend to user online sports viewing more frequently . Also , they showed a distinguished chatting behavior of concentrating on a few teams . The intra membership motive has a significant relationship with the use of team specific chat filtering . This reflects that those who have high fan membership want to communicate with other members . The length of chats was also negatively correlated with the intra membership , partly because they frequently use simple cheering expressions . 3 .
