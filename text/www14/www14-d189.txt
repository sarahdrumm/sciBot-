ABSTRACT The proliferation of mobile devices that are capable of estimating their position , has lead to the emergence of a new class of social networks , namely location based social networks ( LBSNs for short ) . The main interaction between users in an LBSN is location sharing . While the latter can be realized through continuous tracking of a user ’s whereabouts from the service provider , the majority of LBSNs allow users to voluntarily share their location , through check ins . LBSNs provide incentives to users to perform check ins . However , these incentives can also lead to people faking their location , thus , generating false information . In this work , we propose the use of tensor decomposition for spotting anomalies in the check in behavior of users . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to model this problem using tensor analysis .

INTRODUCTION
Location Based Social Networks tie the virtual and physical space through location information . The latter can enable a number of novel services . Some systems offer Grouponlike deals , providing monetary incentives for users and corporations to adopt their usage . As another example , the LBSN provider can use all the information generated from check ins to perform recommendations .
Given that humans respond to incentives and that the motives for adopting LBSN usage are now extended to the realworld [ 5 ] , people are tempted to game the underlying system and generate false information . In fact , as very illustratively posited by LBSNs service providers ” unfortunately , most of

Figure 1 : Given a ( user , venue , day ) tensor T , we obtain a decomposition into F rank one components , each corresponding to a different latent pattern in the data . them [ check ins ] are fake ” 1 . Therefore , this socio spatiotemporal information will be devalued as long as it is not trustworthy .
In this work , we propose a novel approach , based on tensor decomposition , for spotting anomalies2 in LBSNs . Our system is generic , in the sense that it does not target any specific misbehavior . We model the problem of detecting interesting and potentially misbehaving patterns in LBSNs by formulating it as a tensor , and consequently , analyzing and summarizing the data leveraging tensor decompositions . Each identified component is essentially a bag of check ins , possibly from multiple users , over multiple time periods . Related Studies There has been some body of work pertaining to location faking in LBSNs [ 4 ] , sybil attack 3 detection [ 8 ] . There has been work in the literature that employs tensors for anomaly detection such as [ 6 , 7 ] . However , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to model and tackle the problem at hand using tensor decompositions . 2 . OUR APPROACH
We propose to cast the problem of spotting anomalies and misbehaviors in LBSNs as an instance of tensor analysis . An n mode tensor , is a generalization of a matrix ( 2 mode tensor ) in n dimensions . In our case we model the spatiotemporal information as a 3 mode ( user , venue , time ) tensor T . Hence , T(i , j , k ) = 1 , iff user i was at venue j at time k . Otherwise , T(i , j , k ) = 0 . A means of analyzing a tensor is the Canonical Polyadic ( CP ) or PARAFAC decomposition [ 3 ] . In particular , CP/PARAFAC decomposes T
F￿f =1 to a sum of F components , such that T ≈ af ◦ bf ◦ cf , where af ◦ bf ◦ cf ( i , j , k ) = af ( i)bf ( j)cf ( k ) In other words ,

Each vector in the triplet corresponds to one of the three modes of the tensor : a corresponds to the users , b corresponds to the venues , and c corresponds to the days ( see also Fig 1 ) Each of these F components can be considered as a cluster , and the corresponding vector elements as soft clustering indicators . For the purposes of this work , we use the , highly optimized , Tensor Toolbox for Matlab [ 1 ] . Intuition behind the use of tensors : Tensor decompositions attempt to summarize the given data tensor into a reduced rank representation . , favoring dense groups on the way of accomplishing it . As an immediate outcome of this process , we expect near bipartite cores ( in three modes ) of people who check in at certain places for a certain period of time , to appear as a result of the decomposition . In our experiments we use a dataset Data description : obtained from Foursquare [ 2 ] . The original dataset , includes geo tagged user generated content from a variety of social media that was pushed to Twitter ’s public feed between September 2010 and January 2011 . Each tweet includes location information in the following format : <userID , tweetID , text , location , time , venueID> .
We remove check ins in locations ie , ( lat , lon ) pairs that can possibly correspond to more than one venues that have less than 10 check ins in total and we eventually get our final dataset of 6,699,516 check ins , in 461,690 venues from 186,083 users . In order to form T , we discretize time in bins of one day , and hence , the entry T(i , j , k ) of the tensor is the number of check ins user i made at venue j on day k . Our results : In Figure 2 we present two exemplary anomalies . The most impressive anomalous pattern discovered is the one of subfigure 2(a ) , where the temporal evolution of the group of user and venue is almost perfectly periodic , resembling the behavior of a bot .
Key to our approach is the temporal dimension . In many cases , the temporal behavior of a group of users and venues is able to differentiate a sybil attack from , say , a group of friends , checking in at the same restaurant at lunch time every day ; the sybil attack should exhibit some anomaly in time ( either a burst or a spike ) , whereas the normal behavior , should , usually , be quasi periodic . By modeling our data as a tensor , and formulating the problem in this fashion , we include time in our analysis , a fact that enables us to produce more intuitive and interpretable results . For instance , the pattern at Figure 2(b ) represents a user that has checked in to a ( small ) number of venues many times . This is a possible indicator of a user that wants to gain virtual ( eg , points , badges , “ mayorships ” in Foursquare etc . ) and/or real life rewards ( eg , unlocking special offers that require multiple check ins ) .
3 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we present a preliminary approach for spotting anomalies in check in patterns of users in LBSNs using tensors . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first attempt to model this problem using tensor decompositions . Our approach is generic in the sense that it does not require special infrastructure and coordination with the LBSN provider . Future directions include exploiting data sparsity to improve our methods , as well as evaluating our approach on different LBSNs .
