ABSTRACT In this paper , we propose a social evolutionary game to investigate the evolution of social networks . Through comparison between simulation and empirical analysis on the social networks of Twitter and Sina Weibo , we validate the effectiveness of the proposed model and estimate the evolutionary phases of the two networks . We find that the users of Sina Weibo can withstand comparatively more costs than the users of Twitter . Therefore , they can perform more positive behavior and consider more about their reputation than Twitter users . Moreover , the evolutionary time of Sina Weibo to a stable state is longer than that of Twitter .

INTRODUCTION
Social ties in online social networks , including stable ties and temporary ties , emerge and vanish through users’ interactions due to the change of their internal or external factors , causing the topological variation of social networks . Therefore , it is of great importance to study and understand the dynamic and evolutionary nature of social networks [ 1 ] . We propose a social evolutionary game ( SEG )

Beijing , China cxq@ictaccn in which each player aims to improve its short term utility and long term reputation by imitating its partners’ strategy and adjusting its social ties , respectively . Through simulations on SEG , we investigate the underlying mechanisms of how players’ short term utility and long term reputation affect , and co evolve with , the topology of social networks . Comparative analysis is conducted between the simulation results and empirical studies of two datasets collected from Twitter and Sina Weibo , in order to validate the underlying mechanisms and investigate the evolutionary process of the social networks in Twitter and Sina Weibo .
2 . SOCIAL EVOLUTIONARY GAME
The proposed social evolutionary game is an evolutionary game played by a group of selfish players in periods t = 1 , 2 , 3 , . . . . Let G = ( V , E ; U , R ) denote an SEG , where |V | = n is the set of players , |E| = m is the set of edges among players , U = {U1 , U2,··· , Un} and R = {R1 , R2,··· , Rn} are the sets of utility and reputation functions corresponding to the players in V , respectively . Utility indicates a player ’s short term concern that is mathematically the sum of payoffs it earns from all of its opponents in a game period with the current strategy profile . Reputation is actually a player ’s long term concern suggesting the opinions of other players to it , which is determined by the evaluation of other players on the behavior history of this player . Each player i ∈ V has two alternative strategies : si ∈ {C , D} , where C represents its positive strategy that causes i to pay a cost c and its partner to receive a benefit b , while D represents its negative strategy that does not cause any cost to player i and doest not cause any benefit to its partner . The payoff matrix A is a simplified Prisoner ’s Dilemma and the parameter is the cost to benefit ratio , c/b . A(si , sj ) , where Ni is
The utility of player i is Ui = j∈Ni the set of i ’s partners .

The evolutionary dynamics of SEG is built on the results of players’ myopic decisions , as any player can only be aware of the local information about its current partners and the partners’ partners . At each time step t , the player is randomly chosen to either adjust its interaction partners or update its current strategy with probabilities τ

Adjusting social ties : Player i creates a connection to a new partner and breaks an existing tie depending on its and its partners’ reputation scores . Upon i ’s current reputation score ri , there are three subi = {R|ri − λ ≤ R ≤ ri + λ} ranges : r+ i = {R|R < ri − λ} , where λ is a threshold . Player − and r i finds a new partner by two different ways , either searching a new partner with the highest reputation score among its partners’ partners whose reputation score falls into r+ i with probability pr , or just randomly selecting a new partner from its partners’ partners with probability 1 − pr . pr indicates the tendency of personal preference on the basis of reputation . Meanwhile , i breaks up the social tie with the one having the lowest reputation among its partners whose − reputation score falls into r i ; Updating strategy : Player i imitates the strategy with the maximum utility among those used by its partners , according to a probability ϕ , which depends on the utility difference ∆u = uj −ui . Specifically , we 1+e−β∆u [ 2 ] , where adopt the Fermi function and have ϕ = β indicates a player ’s willingness to imitate others’ strategy . Whenever a player is chosen to update its strategy , its reputation is updated simultaneously .

A set of Monte Carlo simulations were conducted with different c/b and pr for investigating the evolution of social networks , which are characterized by four metrics , namely , the fraction of players performing positive behavior ( fc ) , clustering coefficient ( cc ) of the corresponding social network , the exponent ( α ) of the power law distribution of players’ degrees and the evolutionary time of social networks . Figure 1 presents the final states of simulations under one of three constraints : full positive behavioral players , full negative behavioral players , and the deviation of fc under a tiny threshold in a large time steps . The final states of the four metrics suggest that the reputation mechanism encourages and speeds up the emergence of positive behavior , and promotes the dense of network more closely . Meanwhile , a larger pr can enhance players’ ability to withstand a greater c/b .
3 . EVOLUTIONARY ANALYSIS
Two datasets containing user profiles and messages of more than 250 , 000 user accounts were collected from Twitter and Sina Weibo in October 2011 and October 2012 . By considering two way interactions rather than one way follow relationships , the networks were reduced to undirected ones . As the aforementioned four metrics , we calculated the average values of fc , cc and α of both Twitter and Sina Weibo : fc = 0.610 , cc = 0.2883 and α = 1.7484 of Twit

( c ) the estimation of evolutionary phase of Twitter and Sina Weibo , according to the overlap in ( a ) and ( b ) . ter ; fc = 0.935 , cc = 0.3716 and α = 1.9455 of Sina Weibo . Comparing to the final states in Figure 1(a) (c ) , we observed that the three calculated metrics of both Twitter and Sina Weibo are partly mapped to the evolutionary patterns of the conducted simulations . The four subgraphs in Figure 1 depict the four aspects of the evolution of social networks , and the metrics of a social network should have the same value interval of c/b and pc , respectively . Based on this hypothesis , we could estimate the evolutionary phase and the corresponding characteristics of Twitter and Sina Weibo , according to the calculated metrics .
We merged the intersection areas of both Twitter and Sina Weibo from Figure 1(a) (c ) with the three corresponding calculated metrics . The existence of the overlapping areas in Figure 2(a ) and ( b ) validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the evolutionary patterns in Figure 1 . By comparing the overlap in Figure 1(a ) and 1(b ) , it can be observed that the users of Sina Weibo can withstand comparatively more costs than the users of Twitter to perform more positive behavior ( eg , retweet , comment , etc. ) , and consider more about their reputations . The intervals of c/b and pr of both networks are obtained from their overlap , and are substituted in Figure 1(d ) to estimate the uncomputable evolutionary phase of both networks . Based on Figure 2(c ) , we obtained the average evolutionary time tT witter and tSinaW eibo . The ratio tSinaW eibo = 1.0373 shows that tT witter the evolutionary time of Sina Weibo is longer than that of Twitter to reach a stable state .
