ABSTRACT The Web is becoming increasingly pervasive throughout all aspects of human activity . As citizens and organisations adopt Web technologies , so governments are beginning to respond by themselves utilising the electronic space . Much of this has been reactive , and there is very little understanding of the impact that Web technologies are having on government systems and processes , let alone a proactive approach to designing systems that can ensure a positive and beneficial societal impact . The ecosystem which encompasses governments , citizens and communities is both evolving and adaptive , and the only way to the development of Web enabled examine and understand government , and to consider government itself as a “ social machine ” within a social machine ecosystem . In this light , there are significant opportunities and challenges for government that this paper identifies .

THE CHANGING SHAPE OF GOVERNMENT AND CITIZEN INTERACTION
“ An ecosystem is a community of living organisms … in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment . … ( D)efined by the network of interactions among organisms , and between organisms and their environment . ” [ 1 ]
Government exists as a mechanism for collective action in order to fulfill citizen and community needs , and it does this by articulating societal values through policies and programmes

As such it is essentially a “ system ” within an “ ecosystem ” , which operates through the interaction of citizen behaviours and administrative processes driven by the collection , curation and management of information . In past eras the so called “ machinery of government ” [ 2 ] had characteristics the properties of information in the physical world . As information becomes digital in format so government processes are slowly changing and adapting to the affordances of digital systems , but this is resulting in some fundamental changes in the relationships which exist , and an opportunity to challenge some of the established thinking around the role of "The State" . The UK ’s “ Power of Information ” report argued that government should “ grasp the opportunities that are emerging in terms of the creation , consumption and re use of information ” , in essence , government in the digital age can , and should , be “ reinvented ” [ 3 ] .
The first phase of this “ reinvention ” was where governments created an electronic publishing space on the Web and sought to transfer some services online ; the second phase has seen governments respond to the adoption of Web 2.0 technologies by seeking to more effectively engage with citizens through Social Media as an online “ dialogue ” ; the third phase sees governments attempting to become more responsive , dynamic and “ open ” through trying to develop interoperability between government processes , and adopt a “ citizen centric ” approach to information and communications through an intelligent use of data . All of these may be seen as the building blocks of “ e ” or “ electronicgovernment ” , but this is a simplistic way of viewing government in the digital age because it does not provide :
• An understanding of the fragility and risks of eGovernment models which rely on both the data generated by citizens , community and business , and the intermediary role of third party systems as exchange “ platforms ” ;
• Any way of identifying , studying , and , if need be , preventing , the side effects which may impact on the ecosystem as a whole as it interacts with the broader societal and business context ; or
• The ability to understand the links between mechanisms of efficient citizen engagement and policy formulation , and from there to intentionally design socio technical systems which have positive societal impacts .
Governments exist within ecosystems of people and organisations , and , as these systems become more interconnected
903 via digital interaction technologies a new model is required to describe their development , operation and implications . One such model is that of the “ social machine ” . 2 . GOVERNMENT AS A SOCIAL MACHINE
The “ social machine ” has been described as a system “ where human and computational intelligence coalesce in order to achieve a given purpose . ” [ 4 ] Social machines can be seen as the interaction of individual action and co ordination , mediated and enabled by the “ shared communication substrate of the Web ” [ 5 ] . For governments this translates as “ collaboration platforms – for organizing work at a distance that could translate into ways to get all hands on deck to undertake action together . ” [ 6 ]
At a base level the promise of “ Web 2.0 ” technologies lies in the efficient architecture of a socio technical system within which citizens provide their data ( in all formats , structured and unstructured ) and , in response , governments should be better able to understand societal needs and , as a result , more effectively and efficiently deliver services and develop policy . The hope is that instead of “ vending machine government ” , where we pay our taxes and expect services in return , the role of government is more like being the manager of the marketplace , or the bazaar , where the community exchanges goods and services and actively participates , leading to enhanced democratic processes [ 7 ] . Studying government as a social machine allows us to put every aspect of Web mediated citizen engagement with government in perspective , and better explore opportunities for collective action , problem solving and societal impact in a holistic way , or real scenarios where “ people will not see their influence limited to elections every four to five years ; rather , citizens will exercise permanent influence through constant suggestions , ideas , and contributions , all organized over the internet . ” [ 8 ] 3 . GOVERNMENT IN A SOCIAL MACHINE ECOSYSTEM Government exists through the “ relationships ” with those who are “ governed ” – citizens , businesses and communities . Many of the processes that government is adopting rely on other social machines , including social machines such as Twitter or Ushahidi . This adds the extra dimension of government as a social machine within an ecosystem of social machines and brings forward a number of significant questions that need to be addressed :
1 . How does Government acting ( or viewing ) itself as part of a "social machine ” ecosystem change the way that it interacts with citizens , businesses and communities ?
2 . How are Government processes and their sustainability affected by existing social machines maintained by other parties ? ( eg by Twitter , Wikipedia , Ushahidi ) ?
3 . How can governments best safeguard the privacy and security of citizen information in this ecosystem as a core component of the “ social compact ” ? redefine role , responsibilities and processes ) within the complex and interdependent environment of social machines ? its
4 . How should Government
4 . CONCLUSION Governments around the world are seeking to understand , leverage and proactively manage socio technical systems in order to more effectively and efficiently meet community needs .
However , “ ( m)ost of the failings of government can be connected to the fundamental assumption that humans are rational creatures and the inherent structural biases toward mechanical processes and short term thinking . … We need designers , political scientists , and social activists … to take up the challenge of designing new systems of governance … that are open , accessible , and learning . They need to embody the latest thinking about how the world works , how people work , and how we can use our technologies to make life better for all . ” [ 9 ] That “ latest thinking ” should embrace the potential and promise of “ emergent systems ” , in particular the concept of “ social machines ” , in order to better respond to the dynamic nature of society and to accommodate the complexity of the required interactions and services . Government can then be imagined not a fixed and rigid edifice , but rather as a dynamic and emergent [ 10 ] social machine , within an ecosystem of other ancillary and complementary social machines , and its systems and processes evolve as to societal needs . 5 .
