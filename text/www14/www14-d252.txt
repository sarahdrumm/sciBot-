ABSTRACT The proposed demonstration requests DBPedia.org , gets the results and uses them to populate wiki pages with semantic annotations using RDFaLite . These annotations are persisted in a RDF store and we will show how this data can be reused by other applications , eg for a semantic mashup that displays all collected metadata about cities on a single map page . It has been developed using WikiNEXT , a mix between a semantic wiki and a web based IDE . The tool is online1 , open source2 ; screencasts are available on YouTube ( look for “ WikiNext ” ) . Categories and Subject Descriptors K43 [ Organizational Impacts ] : Computer supported collaborative work . Keywords Semantic Web , Web2.0 , Wikis , Semantic Wikis , Knowledge Management , Web Applications 1 . Introduction / motivation Wikis appeared in 1995 with Ward Cunningham ’s wiki , changing radically the way people could produce documents on the web . It was the beginning of the web 20 Soon many different wiki engines ( this is how we call the software that powers wiki web sites ) appeared , specialized for writing online encyclopedias ( MediaWiki , that powers Wikipedia ) , or targeted to private organizations [ 5 ] . We call these ones “ application wikis ” , they propose features , such as : database integration , access control , versioning , possibility to embed HTML forms in pages , templates for formatting documents , and the possibility to write small applications using the page editor . Wiki engines such as TWiki , FOSWiki , TikiWiki , Confluence , XWiki , Mindtouch , belong to that category of wikis . In 2005 , researchers from the Semantic Web domain introduced the “ semantic wikis ” : wikis for creating/maintaining ontologies ( data models ) collaboratively and/or for annotating wiki content with semantic metadata , and enable requesting/reasoning on the embedded data . Overviews of such wikis can be found in [ 5 ] . Our group has a strong experience in that field as we developed two semantic wikis over the last seven years . We also wrote for the W3C3 an HTML5 course4 that includes lots examples that involve HTML/JavaScript/CSS . This course is powered by the

Integrating interactive programming examples in moodle turned to be so painful and limited ( using , iframes ) that we hosted externally the examples on jsbin.com , a popular web based IDE . Our research group also developed the French version of DBPedia.org6 , a semantic database that holds the data from Wikipedia and accepts SPARQL7 . This project needed a front end for developing examples programs that consume and exploit its data . Here , too , we imagined a wiki engine that could act as a front end : one could write applications from within the wiki , which can talk to DBPedia.fr , could write tutorials made both of text and application code that can be modified collaboratively . These ideas led to WikiNext , a wiki engine that integrates HTML5/JavaScript , proposes some APIs for exploiting the web of data ( request and process data from different sources , cache them , aggregate them , write code that manipulate them for visualization , mashups , annotating text content , etc ) WikiNEXT mixes the editing of “ documents ” and the editing of “ source code of applications within the documents ” , provides a templating system , comes with examples , tutorials , has features for adding external JavaScript libraries , etc . 2 . State of the art Semantic Wikis : The first wave of semantic wikis started in 2005 , with wiki engines such as Semantic Media Wiki [ 1 ] , IkeWiki [ 2 ] OntoWiki [ 4 ] or SweetWiki [ 3 ] . They all proposed to add semantic metadata to documents , and used internally some formal language to store them , such as RDF ( Resource Description Framework ) , OWL ( Web Ontology Language ) , or Conceptual Graphs [ 7 ] . These metadata can be exploited to add new the wiki : augmented navigation , visualization of metadata , search and retrieval or reasoning . The SPARQL language8 is often used internally for querying RDF data . Wiki engines like Semantic MediaWiki based on the MediaWiki engine , or SemperWiki[8 ] used wiki markup syntax for adding semantic annotations to wiki pages . OntoWiki is more of an ontology editor , and proposes user friendly interface that offers different views and browsing and editing interfaces over existing data . Today , semantic wikis , which are still active [ 15 ] either ( 1 ) kept adding new functionalities using plugins or extensions or ( 2 ) relied on external tools or web services . The Halo9 extension of Semantic Media Wiki proposes forms , auto completion , a WYSIWYG editor , the integration of audios and videos files , and the integration of a SPARQL endpoint , or more complex

4.3 Reusing data To demonstrate data reuse , we try to recombine data sources on the wiki , creating what is typically known as mash up by developing a web application that combines all the created cities on WikiNEXT . The Error! Reference source not found . displays the output map of the wiki application that retrieves the location of all cities available in our knowledge base and shows all cities on a map and in a table . WikiNEXT uses SPARQL to query its knowledge base . Hence , queries can be written without having to deal with semantic heterogeneity problems since we use predefined ontologies .

5 . Discussion and Conclusions WikiNEXT is a “ programmable wiki for the Linked Data ” : a wiki in which we can write documents with an application layer that exploits the web of Data . Applications are written using standard HTML/CSS/JavaScript , and can be shared , cloned , improved collaboratively . We also designed an API and protocols for keeping a tight , synchronous link between the data embedded in the pages and the databases on the server side . The demonstration we propose consists in presenting live the WikiNEXT principles for writing documents and linked data applications directly in the browser . We propose to reproduce live , the City scenario described in the paper , showing how WikiNEXT simplifies the programming of such applications ,
