ABSTRACT Agenda setting theory explains how media affects its audience . While traditional media studies have done extensive research on agenda setting , there are important limitations in those studies , including using a small set of issues , running costly surveys of public interest , and manually categorizing the articles into positive and negative frames . In this paper , we propose to tackle these limitations with a computational approach and a large dataset of online news . Overall , we demonstrate how to carry out a large scale computational research of agenda setting with online news data using machine learning .

INTRODUCTION
In communications and media studies , agenda setting [ 3 ] is an important theory for explaining the effect of media on public opinion . We propose that the vast and ever increasing amounts of user comments and social sharing data on online news sites , combined with recent advances in text mining techniques , enable a deeper and broader analysis of media effects . In this paper , we apply machine learning to extract meaningful patterns from online news and offer an effective alternative to traditional agenda setting research .
Specifically , we address the following . First , because of limited resources in terms of news data and public input , usually measured by surveys about the “ most important problems ” ( MIP ) , each agenda setting study only considers a few issues , hand picked by the researchers [ 5 ] . The validity of the survey based methods are questioned , and researchers discuss how social media may replace or supplement the surveys [ 6 ] . Also , content analysis for positive and negative tone is done by manual coding which is time consuming [ 2 ] .
We tackle these limitations with a computational approach to agenda setting research . The first step of our approach is to obtain data from a news website and collect user com∗This work was performed while the author was a visiting professor at KAIST , Division of Web Science and Technology , under the WCU ( World Class University ) program .

The second step is to automatically discover issues using machine learning and analyze the media effects for the issues . The third step is to replace manual coding by an algorithm to automatically discover the polarity of the articles and the corresponding comments . With these , we define a new perspective of media effects , we show the advantages of computational media effects research , and we reveal the potential of applying machine learning to discover issues and sentiment patterns in articles and comments . While recent research [ 4 ] has modeled agenda setting with a machine learning algorithm , our focus is on the effect on the public , measured by their responses in the form of comments and shares .
2 . DATA AND METHOD
We use npr.org ( National Public Radio ) , and we collect news articles , all comments on those articles , and the commenters’ user IDs from eight news sections from Jan 2011 to Apr 2013 . We collected 17,674 articles and 763,721 comments from 117,111 commenters . In addition to the comments , users share the articles using social network services such as Facebook , and we collected the number of shares for each article , with a total of 27,886,921 shares for all articles . To identify important issues , we use a nonparametric topic model , the hierarchical Dirichlet process ( HDP ) [ 7 ] . With the goal of assigning a single issue per each article , we set the hyperparameter α to a small value such that each article is constrained to have a very few number of issues . We control the granularity of the issues by adjusting the η prior.To analyze the degree of agenda setting , we look at users’ news sharing and commenting behaviors separately , and analyze the degree of media effect by looking at the correlations of those behaviors with the amount of news coverage . We look at the correlation patterns of issue coverage and the three factors , number of comments , number of unique commenters , and sharing counts , for each issue .
3 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS
Using HDP , we found seven issues from the Sports section , ten issues from Technology , eleven issues from Business and World , twelve issues from Politics and Opinion , thirteen issues from Health , and fifteen issues from Science . The number of articles of each issue varies , and we select and use issues with more than one hundred articles . Table 1 shows a few example issues from the Politics section .
The results show large and significant correlations for almost all issues and comments , and most of the issues for shares . Among the eight sections , Sports and Technology keywords romney gingrich republican santorum government court gun voter rights state republican election party walker
#articles 575 195 167

There are several questions we have not addressed in this paper . We only used NPR as our dataset to identify media effects . Although NPR is one of the major online news outlets , for more comprehensive analysis of media effects on general public , we would need to collect data from a variety of different sources . Many questions remain , such as the accuracy of all the steps of the computational analysis . While the individual methods have been tested and used extensively , the validity and effectiveness for analyzing agenda setting effects are not as clear . Finally , agenda setting research has many deep questions . As this is a first study in applying computational methods to agenda setting theory , we plan to delve into some of the more detailed questions in agenda setting research with computational tools .

Figure 1 : ( a ) banks and loan and ( b ) education and government . Red bars ( upper ) show the no . of articles , and blue bars ( lower ) the no . of comments . show the largest correlations between issue coverage and sharing , and World shows the smallest . A closer look at two examples showing different degree of agenda setting are shown in Figure 1 . The Business issue on banks and loan shows a large agenda setting effect , whereas the Opinion issue on education and government shows a small effect .
Our sentiment analysis works by taking a set of seed words and using topic modeling to expand the positive and negative words [ 1 ] . Sentences in the article ( or comments ) are assigned sentiment scores according to the number of positive and negative sentiment words in the sentence . This sentiment lexicon expansion shows issue dependent sentiment words , such as “ cutthroat ” ( negative in Business ) , “ victory ” ( positive in Sports ) , and “ benign ” ( positive in Health ) .
We look at the sharing and commenting behaviors for articles with positive and negative sentiments and find interesting patterns . Figure 2 shows the average number of comments and shares in positive and negative articles , as well as the entire set of articles . An interesting pattern is that users’ shares show high interest in Science and Health , but their comments show high interests in Politics and Business . In general , users share more positive articles than negative , except in Politics and Sports . In Sports , negative articles are about losses , so there is no difference between negative and positive articles for sharing . Positive articles in Science are about new findings , so there is a significant increase in sharing . For commenting , users tend to leave more comments on negative articles than on positive articles , especially for Politics . This reflects frequent heated discussions on criticisms about the current politics . The reverse is true for Health , where users discuss positive articles about improving health . These results illustrate that using a computational approach to media effects analysis alleviates several limitations of the traditional media effects studies . The most important advantage of a computational approach is the scale of the study . By using machine learning to automatically discover the issues and sentiments , we were able to get results from over 17,000 articles , 763,000 comments , 28 million shares .
