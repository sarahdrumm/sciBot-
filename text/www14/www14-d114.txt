ABSTRACT Massively multiplayer online role playing games ( MMORPGs ) simulate the real world and require highly complex user interaction . Many human behaviors can be observed in MMORPGs , such as social interactions , economic behaviors , and malicious behaviors . In this study , we primarily focus on malicious behavior , especially cheating using game bots . Bots can be diffused on the social network in an epidemic style . When bots diffuse on the social network , a user ’s influence on the diffusion process varies owing to different characteristics and network positions . We aim to identify the influentials in the game world and investigate how they differ from normal users . Identifying the influentials in the diffusion of malicious behaviors will enable the game company to act proactively and preventively towards malicious users such as game bot users .

1 . INTRODUCTION MMORPGs are very similar to the real world and require complex user interaction . Many human behaviors , such as social , economic , and malicious behaviors , can be observed in MMORPGs . Players take pre scheduled courses to achieve highlevel characters and become rich in cyber assets . These courses require lengthy and repetitive play . To circumvent this and acquire more cyber assets in a shorter period , users have started to cheat , especially by using game bots . Since bot players’ activities and the extraordinary level up of friends are noticeable in the game world , normal users are exposed to more game bots when their friends use bots . Therefore , game bots can be diffused on the social network in an epidemic style [ 1 , 2 ] . Most of game companies ban bot users’ accounts when they repeatedly use game bots . Banning accounts often cause a legal issue between the user and the game company and the detection has low effectiveness in preventing bot use . By targeting influential users ,

In this study , we will identify the influentials who diffuse the malicious behavior in MMORPGs . We expect this study to usher in a new era of preventive strategies against game bots .
2 . RESULTS In this study , we aim to test following hypotheses that some users are more influential than others and the number of friends a user has does not necessarily equate to a high level of influence on others . Previous works on user influence showed that the above hypothesis is supported in product adoption , information diffusion , and disease outbreaks [ 3 , 4 ] . Understanding of the different roles of users in online games is important for game marketing , game design , and a security strategy . We used the anonymized database that includes the bot detection records and users interaction records between December 21 , 2011 , and March 21 , 2012 from AION , a prominent MMORPG developed by NCSoft . 94,864 characters played the game during that period and 54,989 characters were on the friend network . The bot detection code was recorded to 14,327 characters . We considered users whose the numbers of bot records exceed 1 as bot users . We define spreader as the initial character who use the game bot before his/her friends start to use it . Among 8,332 bot characters , 4,879 characters were estimated as spreaders and 5,851 characters were observed as imitators . To confirm the existence of super spreaders , we examine the induced sub graph of the friendship network , which includes spreaders and imitators . The induced sub graph has a large variance with exponential distribution as shown in Figure 1 . We found that MMORPGs contain super spreaders similar to those in an epidemic .

315 We compared a spreader ’s rank in terms of the number of friends and the number of spread as shown in Table 1 . Overall , the rank of the spread is proportional to the rank of the number of friends . That is , the more friends a character has the more chances the character has to spread . However , this is not a necessary condition for super spreaders since top 1 % and 10 % of spreaders have correlation less than 05

Then , whom should we target to prevent the spread of bot use effectively ? To answer the question , we investigate users’ friends , and users’ bot usage patterns and play patterns . As we can see in Table 2 , heavy users tend to have more spread toward other friends . Half of the spreaders have at least 33 % of their friends using bots . The adoption of the game bot exhibits the positive network effects . This indicates the existence of the contagion .

We measured a user ’s game involvement by estimating the number of connections and playtime per a user . In addition , character level is another important discriminator to explain a user ’s game involvement level . As a user puts in more effort , the character achieves higher levels . Table 3 shows that , spreaders showed high involvement in terms of connection time and play time compared to top 10 % of friend holders . However , the character level is not a significant measure for identifying spreaders . Furthermore , we analyzed the in game characteristics of spreaders including character gender and job . Spreaders do not show any meaningful difference in game characteristics such as character gender and character job . Finally , we investigate the user interaction between spreader vs . imitators and spreader vs . non imitator . In our case , imitators are those who adopt the game bot after their friends use them . This analysis will reveal whether or not user interaction affects the spread . In general , imitators have much more frequent interactions with others as shown in Table 4 . Imitators take part in party play and trade more frequently than non imitators in existence of spreaders in their friend lists . terms of in

Furthermore , as we can see in Table 5 , the interaction between spreaders and imitators is much stronger than that between spreaders and non imitators in terms of interaction frequency .

3 . CONCLUSIONS In this work , we aimed to characterize spreaders in MMORPGs . To this end , we explored the influential characteristics in terms of social interactions and game activity . To find out vital factors that make contagion between spreaders and imitators , we analyzed the interaction strength between them . Using a large amount of real data from a major MMORPG , we obtained the following findings from the empirical study : First , users who have many friends are not equal to those who have a high influence on others . Second , the induced sub graph consisting of spreaders and imitators is a high variance network . This implies that some users have much higher than others . Third , spreaders have high commitment in the game play . They play longer and more frequently . Fourth , through frequent interactions between spreaders and imitators . In the future , from the perspective of network resilience , we will study how the diffusion process is affected by the removal of influentials . Tracking the changes of the influence network as influentials are removed will enable us to design a predictive and effective prevention strategy against bot users . 4 .
