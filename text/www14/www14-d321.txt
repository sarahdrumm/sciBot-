ABSTRACT We propose a novel method to predict accurately trust relationships of a target user even if he/she does not have much interaction information . The proposed method considers positive , implicit , and negative information of all users in a network based on belief propagation to predict trust relationships of a target user .

INTRODUCTION
Trust prediction methods , which predict future trust relationships of users , have been proposed to find trustable users in social networks [ 1][2][3 ] . In social networks , users explicitly make trust and distrust relationships with other users and rate other users’ contents as well . These activities are called interaction information between users [ 2][3 ] .
Most previous methods for link prediction infer trust relationships between two users based on the interaction information . In case two users have not much interaction information , the previous methods cannot infer the trust relationship . Also , they use only partial information of the interaction , thereby being difficult to predict trust relationships .
To solve the problem , we propose a novel trust prediction method using belief propagation ( BP ) [ 4 ] . The proposed method measures each user ’s trustworthiness for a target user by using the interaction information of all users . Also , the proposed method considers all types of interaction information , the trust , distrust , and ratings , to measure the trustworthiness accurately . We show the effectiveness of the proposed method via a series of experiments .

2 . THE PROPOSED METHOD
BP is an algorithm that infers the state of a node by computing the belief score of the node [ 4 ] . The belief score of a node means the probability which the node is in a specific state . In this paper , two states of a node are defined : <trustable , distrustful > . The belief score of a node is computed by exchanging messages between nodes . The message is a node ’s opinion about a neighboring node ’s possibility of being in a specific state . The messages sent from one node to a neighbor are represented as a vector . The elements of the vector are the two states of a node mentioned above . Each message that node ui sends to node uj is computed as follows :
∑
∏
ϕi(xq)ψ(xq , xp ) xq2X k2N ( i)nj mij(xq )
( 1 ) mij(xp ) ←
In this equation , two states xp and xq exist . mij(xp ) represents the message that ui sends to uj , indicating ui ’s opinion about uj ’s probability of being in state xp . ϕi(xq ) is a prior belief which means the probability of ui being in state xq . ψij(xq,xp ) is the probability of uj being in state xp when ui is in state xq . It is defined by the propagation matrix . mij(xp ) is computed with the product of the messages from ui ’s neighbors except uj . It is computed iteratively for a specific number of times or until the message value is converged [ 4 ] . After the computation , the belief scores of each node are computed . The belief scores are represented as a vector with the two states as well . Each belief score is computed as follows . k is a normalization factor .
∏ bi(xp ) = kϕi(xp ) j2N ( i ) mji(xp )

To apply BP to the trust prediction , we construct a network where nodes and directed edges indicate users and interactions between users . The network has two types of edges : the positive and negative edges . The positive edge is created when a user makes a trust relationship with another user and/or rates another user ’s content . The negative edge is created when a user makes a distrust relationship with another user .
After constructing a network , we should assign the prior beliefs of each node . If the prior belief on the trustable state of node ui is high , the message on the trustable state of ui would be also high . As a result , the node nearer to ui gets the higher belief score . In this paper , we assign the prior beliefs of all other nodes as <0.5+α , 0.5–α> ( α : very small number ) and those of the target node as <0.5+α’ , 0.5–α’> ( α’ ≫ α ) to give the higher belief score to the node nearer
303 to the target node . To compute the belief score , we define two propagation matrixes in Table 1(a ) and Table 1(b ) for the positive and negative edges related to ψij(xq,xp ) .
Table 1 : Propagation matrixes
In ψij(xq,xp ) , the column ( source ) represents xq and the row ( destination ) represents xp . For example , in the positive edge , ψij(trustable , trustable ) , the probability of a destination node uj being in state trustable when a source node ui is in state trustable is 0.5 + ε(t + f ( r) ) . ε controls the influence of the source on the destination . t is a binary parameter to represent the existence of trust relationship between two users . If a trust relationship exists , t = 1 , otherwise t = 0 . deleted the target user ’s existing k trust relationships ( k = 25 % , 50 % , 75 % , 100% ) . After that , the proposed method computes the belief score of each node and the previous methods compute the probability of making trust relationships between the target node and every other nodes in the network . For each method , the computed values for all the nodes are sorted in descending order and the top k nodes from the sorted list are selected as predicted results . The accuracy is a ratio of correct predictions to all the predictions .
Figure 2 shows the results . Compared to ITD and ABIT L , our method has higher accuracy by up to 10.1 % and 20.6 % , respectively . The proposed method measures each user ’s trustworthiness for the target user instead of inferring the relationship . Also , our method uses all types of interaction information , the trust , distrust , and ratings , thereby predicts trust relationships more accurately .
Figure 1 : Ratio of trust relationships with respect to the varying number of ratings . f ( r ) is the trust degree measured by the number of ratings from source node ui to destination node uj . If ui gives more ratings to uj , ui is more likely to trust uj [ 3 ] . We examine the correlation between the number of ratings and the existence of trust relationship in a user pair by using Epinions.com data . Figure 1 shows the result . The x axis indicates the number of ratings in a user pair and the y axis does the probability of the user pair having a trust relationship . As the number of ratings increases , the probability also increases . Based on this observation , the proposed method estimates f ( r ) as shown in Table 2 .
Table 2 : f ( r ) with a varying number of ratings
In the propagation matrix of the negative edge , ψij(trustable , trustable ) is 0.5 – ε . This is because ordinary users usually want to avoid distrustful users [ 2][3 ] . The proposed method computes the belief score of each node in a network using the prior belief and the propagation matrixes , and returns the k nodes that have the highest belief scores as a prediction result for the target user . 3 . EXPERIMENTS
In our experiments , we compared the accuracy of the proposed method with two existing methods , ITD [ 3 ] and ABIT L [ 2 ] . The data used in our experiments is Epinions.com data that contains 131,828 users , 717,667 trust relationships , 123,705 distrust relationships , and 13,668,319 ratings [ 1 ] . Parameters of the proposed method were set as follows : α = 0.0001 , α’ = 0.1 , ε = 0005
To measure the accuracy of each method , we first randomly selected a target user who rated other users less than 50 times and has trust relationships less than 20 . Then , we
