ABSTRACT We describe the Joint Effort Topic ( JET ) model and the Author Joint Effort Topic ( αJET ) model that estimate the effort required for users to contribute on different topics . We propose to learn word level effort taking into account term preference over time and use it to set the priors of our models . Since there is no gold standard which can be easily built , we evaluate them by measuring their abilities to validate expected behaviours such as correlations between user contributions and the associated effort .

INTRODUCTION
1 . Recently , much works have explored user behaviour in online communities . However , the effort users put into their contributions has not been quantitatively studied . Understanding the effort that each user requires in her contribution could help in identifying low effort topics as well as relatively high effort topics . In general , it is difficult to measure users’ effort . There has been some research work focusing on topics indirectly relating to effort modelling such as question complexity , user maturity [ 3 ] and user expertise [ 6 , 4 , 1 ] . We hypothesise that users tend to contribute uniformly over a short period of time and that any deviation from their normal contribution patterns indicates a change in the amount of work allocated to each of their contributions . We also assume that each user has her own preferred vocabulary and any vocabulary variations can be used as a proxy measure of effort . Following these assumptions , we propose two models which capture the effort required by users to contribute to different topics , the Joint Effort Topic ( JET ) model and its authored version , the Author Joint Effort Topic ( αJET ) model .
JOINT EFFORT TOPIC ( JET ) MODEL
2 . In this paper we define the concept of contribution effort as a value representing the amount of labour required for contributing or posting to a community ( Definition 1 ) . In other words , contribution effort is a measure of contribution ability rather than content complexity .

In order to quantise effort , we assume that the contribution effort of a particular post can be decomposed into word level effort . In particular , a user has a preferred set of vocabulary terms to use within a certain period of time . Words used more often during this period would incur lower contribution effort . On the contrary , words used less incur higher contribution effort . Therefore , we consider that the effort associated with a given contribution is correlated with the preference associated with particular vocabulary terms . The more a given term is contributed the less contribution effort it involves . On the contrary , the less a term is contributed the more the contribution effort incurred ( H1 ) . Similarly , we also assume that users’ average contribution effort within a certain time period should remain relatively stable ( H2 ) . 2.1 Measuring Effort with Stanines For detecting changes in contribution effort , we use the concept of Stanines1 . Following H1 and H2 , we calculate the effort of a document based on the distribution of word counts within the current time period and the distribution of the word counts during the last M time periods so that each word can be associated with an effort value ranging from 1 ( high effort ) to 9 ( low effort ) . The effort of a given word can be calculated either for a full community or for each individual . For a given user , the effort ep,w associated with a given word w in period p can be calculated based on the deviation from the number of times the same word has been observed in the last M periods for the same user . We refer to the general effort measure as STAN and the author specific effort measure as ASTAN . 2.2 JET and αJET For better accuracy , the effort of a document can then be modelled as a mixture of topic level efforts . Therefore , We propose a Bayesian model which jointly models topics and topic level efforts based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) [ 2 ] . We could simply extend the previously proposed Joint Sentiment Topic ( JST ) [ 5 ] model and replace sentiment labels with effort labels . However , in JST , the sentiment prior knowledge comes from a fixed sentiment lexicon . In our case , the word level effort prior is dynamically computed for each time period based on the aforementioned Stanine method . In addition , we also need to incorporate author information in order to enable the measure of author specific effort . Furthermore , we propose to integrate period information in order to track effort evolution and allow the association of author topics with primary topics so that we can compare the topics and effort of different authors in different time periods more easily . As a result , we distinguish two different effort models : 1 ) The Joint Effort Topic ( JET ) model , the effort model that does not distinguish document authors , and ;
1Stanine ( STAndard NINE ) is a method of scaling test scores on a nine point standard scale and is based on the concept of z scores .
549 ( post more messages ) have lower effort than users that contribute less ( HT1 ) ; 2 ) Users take more time to response on documents that require more effort ( HT2),and ; 3 ) Users have lower effort when using terms they are familiar with ( HT3 ) . We test each hypothesis on two Question Answering ( Q&A ) datasets extracted from the April 2011 Stack Exchange ( SE ) public dataset2 : Cooking ( CO ) and Server Fault ( SF ) . We filter out stop words and words with a relative corpus frequency below 10−5 or higher than 099 Stemming is also applied . For the topics we set K = 5 and K = 15 . The expected behaviours are : 1 ) Activity level ( HT1 ) : Active users should be lower effort than less active users ( µ > µ0 ) ; 2 ) Time to response ( HT2 ) : Fast responding users should have lower effort than slow respondents ( µ < µ0 ) , and ; 3 ) Term preference ( HT3 ) : Users that post using familiar terms should have lower effort than those that post using less familiar terms ( µ < µ0 ) . Looking at the results in Table 1 , we deduce that αJET with priors derived from the Stanine based effort measure is inline with effort expectations and gives more accurate results than JET .

• For each primary topic k ∈ {1K} , draw ψ k ∼ Dir(γ ) , • For each document d ∈ D = ( d1,d2 , . . . ,dD ) , draw φ d ∼ Dir(β ) , σd ∼ Dir(α ) ; for each effort label e ∈ {1E} ( E = 9 ) and primary topic k , draw φd,k,e ∼ Dir(β ) . • For each period p ∈ P = {1P} ( eg day , month , year ) with author a ∈ A = ( a1,a2 , . . . ,aA ) , for each effort label e ∈ {1E} and for each effort topic k ∈ {1K} , draw ψa,p,e,k ∼ Dir(γs ) ,
• For each word position i in document d in period p ,
– choose a primary topic k effort topic ki ∼ φd,k – choose a word wi = w i ∼ φ i,ei , a word w i from the distribution over words defined by the period p , the topic ki , the effort label ei and author a , wi ∼ ψa,p,ei,ki . d , an effort label ei ∼ σd , an i ∼ ψ k i

2.3 Setting Model Priors We use STAN and ASTAN as a rough estimation of word level effort which can be subsequently used to set priors γs dynamically for JET and αJET . As a result , the effort associated with words and documents for a given time period and author can be biased . The bias permits an accurate repartition of the effort associated with words . Rather than directly using the effort index returned by STAN or ASTAN , we chose to smooth the word level effort prior using a normal distribution centred around the effort index . This approach allows a soft assignment of effort label given a word . There are two special cases : 1 ) When p M , there are not sufficient historical data to calculate the effort index ; 2 ) When the current word has never appeared in the previous M periods . In both cases , a default uniform word prior is used . For other hyperparameters , we use uniform priors , α = β = β = 10−4 and γ = γ = 10−7 .
3 . EVALUATION AND RESULTS The lack of gold standard makes it hard to validate the proposed models . Although we cannot measure directly the accuracy of the model for predicting the effort of each user contributions , we can measure its ability to validate expected behaviours such as correlations between user contributions and the associated effort . In order to show the validity of the proposed models , we define a set three hypotheses and perform hypothesis testing on each of them . Our hypotheses are defined as follow : 1 ) Users who contribute a lot weΦβK’xEΨγ ExKDNdkPσαAΨ’γ’ K’fMγSMfw’k’β’Φ’550
