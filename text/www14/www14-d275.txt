ABSTRACT Online advertising is an essential part of the Internet and the main source of revenue for many web centric firms such as search engines , social networks , and online publishers . A key component of online advertising is the auction mechanism which selects and prices the set of winning ads .
This work is inspired by one of the biggest practical drawbacks of the widely popular Vickrey Clarke Groves ( VCG ) mechanism , which is the unique incentive compatible mechanism that maximizes social welfare . It is known that VCG lacks a desired property of revenue monotonicity a natural notion which states that the revenue of a mechanism shouldn’t go down as the number of bidders increase or if the bidders increase their bids . Most firms which depend on online advertising revenue have a large sales team to attract more bidders on their inventory as the general belief is that more bidders will increase competition , and hence revenue . However , the lack of revenue monotonicity of VCG conflicts with this general belief and can be strategically confusing for the firm ’s business .
In this work , we seek incentive compatible mechanisms that are revenue monotone . This natural property comes at the expense of social welfare one can show that it is not possible to get incentive compatibility , revenue monotonicity , and optimal social welfare simultaneously . In light of this , we introduce the notion of Price of Revenue Monotonicity ( PoRM ) to capture the loss in social welfare of a revenuemonotone mechanism .
We further study revenue monotonicity for two important online advertising scenarios . First one is the text vs image ad auction where in an ad slot , one can either show a single image ad or a few text ads . Second one is the video pod auction where we have a video advertising slot of k seconds

INTRODUCTION
Fueled by the growth of Internet and advancements in online advertising techniques , today more and more online firms rely on advertising revenue for their business . Some of these firms include news agencies , media outlets , search engines , social and professional networks , etc . Much of this online advertising business is moving to what ’s called programmatic buying where an advertiser bids for each single impression , sometimes in real time , depending on how he values the ad opportunity . This work is motivated by the need of a desired property in the auction mechanisms that are used in these bid based advertising systems .
A standard mechanism for most auction scenarios is the famous Vickrey Clarke Groves ( VCG ) mechanism . VCG is incentive compatible ( IC ) and maximizes social welfare . Incentive compatibility guarantees that the best response for each advertiser is to report its true valuation . This makes the mechanism transparent and removes the load from the advertisers to calculate the best response . Social welfare is the sum of the valuations of the winners . This value is treated as a proxy for how much all the participants gain from the transaction . What makes VCG mechanism versatile is that it reduces the mechanism design problem into an optimization problem for any scenario .
Even though this versatility of VCG mechanism makes it a popular choice mechanism , however , it doesn’t satisfy an important property , namely , that of revenue monotonicity . Revenue monotonicity says that if one increases the bid values or add new bidders , the total revenue should not go down . To see that VCG is not revenue monotone , consider a simple example of two items and three bidders ( A , B , and C ) . Say bidder A wants only the first item , and has a bid of 2 . Similarly bidder B wants only the second item , and has a bid of 2 . Bidder C wants both the items or nothing , and has a bid of 2 . Now if only bidders A and B participate in the auction , then VCG gives a revenue of 2 , however , if all the three bidders participate , then the revenue goes down to 0 . This lack of revenue monotonicity ( which has been noted several times in the literature ) is one of the serious practical drawbacks of the celebrated VCG mechanism . To think of it , an online firm that depends on advertising revenue puts significant resources in its sales efforts to attract more bidders as the general belief is that more bidders imply more competition which should lead to higher prices . Now to tell this firm that their revenue can go down if they get more bidders can be strategically very confusing for them . To see this from another perspective , say in a search engine firm , there is a team which makes a UI change that increases the click through probability ( CTR ) of the search ads . These changes are thought of as good changes in the firm as they increase the effective bid of the bidders ( the effective bid of a bidder in search advertising is a function of its cost perclick bid and the CTR of its ad ) . Now if after making the change , the revenue goes down , what was supposed to be a good change may seem like a bad change . The point we are trying to make is that there are many teams in a firm , and for these teams to function properly , it is important that the auction mechanisms satisfy revenue monotonicity .
In this paper , with a focus on auctions arising in advertising scenarios , we seek to understand mechanisms that satisfy this additional property of revenue monotonicity ( RM ) . It is well known that for various settings ( including ours ) , no mechanism can satisfy both IC and RM properties while attaining optimal social welfare . In fact it is known that one cannot even hope to get Pareto optimality in social welfare while attaining both IC and RM [ 10 ] . Thus to overcome this bottleneck and develop an understanding of RM mechanisms , we relax the requirement of attaining full social welfare , and define the notion of price of revenue monotonicity ( PoRM ) . Price of revenue monotonicity of an IC and RM mechanism M is the ratio of optimal social welfare to the social welfare attained by the mechanism M . The goal is to design mechanisms that satisfy IC and RM properties and at the same time achieve low price of revenue monotonicity . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that defines and studies this notion of price of revenue monotonicity .
We study two different advertising settings in this paper . The first setting we study is the image text auction . In image text auction there is a special box designated for advertising in a publisher ’s website which can be filled by either k text ads or a single image ad . The second setting is the video pod auction where an advertising break of a certain duration in a video content can be filled with multiple video ads of possibly different durations .
We note that revenue monotonicity is an across instance constraint as it requires total revenue to behave in a certain manner across different instances , where a single instance is defined by fixing the type of the buyers . Note that incentive compatibility is also an across instance con straint . A lot of research effort has gone into understanding incentive compatibility , which has resulted in useful tools for designing incentive compatible mechanisms . Surprisingly , hardly any work has gone into understanding and building tools for designing mechanisms which satisfy the desired property of revenue monotonicity . We believe that understanding revenue monotonicity will shed new fundamental insights into the design of mechanisms for many practical scenarios .
1.1 Related Work
Ausubel and Milgrom [ 1 ] show that VCG satisfies RM if bidders’ valuations satisfy bidder submodularity . Bidders’ valuations satisfy bidders submodularity if and only if for any bidder i and any two sets of bidders S , S with S ⊆ S we have wf(S∪{i})−wf(S ) ≥ wf(S∪{i})−wf(S ) , where wf(S ) is the maximum social welfare achievable using only S . Note that this is a general tool one can use to design revenue monotone mechanisms restrict the range of the possible allocations such that we get bidder submodularity when we run VCG on this range . However , we can show that this general tool is not so powerful by showing that for our auction scenarios , it is not possible to get a mechanism with PoRM better than Ω(k ) by using the above tool .
Ausubel and Milgrom [ 1 ] also show that biddersubmodularity is guaranteed when the goods are substitutes , ie , the valuation function of each bidder is submodular over the goods . However , for many practical scenarios , including ours , the valuation function of the bidders is not submodular . Ausubel and Milgrom [ 1 ] design mechanisms which select allocations that are in the core of the exchange economy for combinatorial auctions . Here an allocation is in the core if there is no coalition of bidders and the seller to trade with each other in a way which is preferred by all the members of the coalition to the allocation . Day and Milgrom [ 3 ] show that core selecting mechanisms that choose a core allocation which minimizes the seller ’s revenue satisfy RM given bidders follow so called best response truncation strategy . Therefore the core selecting mechanism designed by [ 1 ] satisfies RM if the participants play such best response strategy ; although this mechanism is not incentive compatible .
Rastegari et al . [ 10 ] prove that no mechanism for general combinatorial auctions which satisfies IC and RM can achieve weakly maximal social welfare . An allocation is weakly maximal if it cannot be modified to make at least one participant better off without hurting anyone else . In another work [ 9 ] they design a randomized mechanism for combinatorial auctions which achieves weak maximality and expected revenue monotonicity .
Another related work is around the characterization of mechanisms that achieve the IC property . The classic result of Roberts [ 11 ] states that affine maximizers are the only social choice functions that can be implemented using IC mechanisms when bidders have unrestricted quasilinear valuations . Subsequent works study the restricted cases [ 2 , 6 , 12 , 13 ] .
There is also an extensive body of research around designing mechanisms with good bounds on the revenue . Myerson [ 7 ] designs a mechanism which achieves the optimal expected revenue in the single parameter Bayesian setting . Goldbert et al . consider optimizing revenue in prior free settings ( see [ 8 ] for a survey on this ) .
1.2 Our Results
As mentioned earlier , we study two settings : 1 ) imagetext auction , and 2 ) video pod auction . Both these settings can be described using the following abstract model . Say there is a seller selling k identical items to n participants/buyers . Participant i wants either di items or nothing , and has a valuation of vi if gets di items or 0 otherwise . Demand di is assumed to be public knowledge , and valuation vi is assumed to be the private information of the participant i . We want to design a mechanism that is incentive compatible , individually rational ( IR ) , revenuemonotone , and maximizes social welfare . For the image text auction , the demand di ∈ {1 , k} , ie , each participant wants either 1 item ( text ads ) or k items ( image ad ) . For the video pod auction , an item corresponds to a unit time interval ( say one second ) , and the demand di could be any number between 1 and k , ie , di ∈ [ k ] .
The first result of this paper is the following theorem . nality ( IR ) , IC , and RM with PoRM of at most k
Theorem 1 We design a deterministic mechanism for image text auction ( mita ) which satisfies Individual Ratioi ln(k ) , ie , the ratio of mita ’s welfare over the optimal welfare is at most ln(k ) . i=1

The proof of Theorem 1 appears in Section 3 . We outline our mechanism over here : Let v1 ≥ . . . ≥ vn1 be the valuations of text participants and V1 be the maximum valIf maxj∈[k ] j · vj is less uation of the image participants . than V1 , mita gives all the items to the image participant who has valuation V1 , otherwise mita picks the highest j∗ text participants as the winners where j∗ is the maximum number in [ k ] such that j∗ · vj∗ ≥ V1 . Note that the j that maximizes j·vj might be less than the j∗ which is the largest j such that j · vj ≥ V1 . Also note that mita sometimes picks less than k text ads as the winner ( even if there are k or more text ads ) . VCG always picks the maximum number of text ads ( if it decides to allocate the slot to text ads ) ; this is one of the reasons why VCG fails to satisfy RM . When we allow lesser number of text ads to be declared as winners , intuitively , this increases the competition which boosts the revenue and thus helps in achieving RM . Although this comes with a loss in social welfare . than k
Surprisingly , we can also show that the above mechanism achieves the optimal PoRM for the image text auction by proving a matching lower bound . We show that a mechanism that satisfies IR , IC , RM , and two additional mild assumptions of Anonymity ( AM ) and Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives ( IIA ) cannot achieve a PoRM better 1 i . Anonymity means that the auction mechanism doesn’t depend on the identities of the participants ( a formal definition appears in Section 5 ) . IIA means that decreasing the bid of a loosing participant shouldn’t hurt any winner . Note that our mechanism satisfy both AM and IIA as well . Formally , we prove the following theorem whose proof appears in Section 5 . i=1
Theorem 2 There is no deterministic mechanism which satisfies IR , IC , RM , AM , and IIA and has PoRM less than k

Theorem 3 We design a Mechanism for Video pod Auction ( mvpa ) which satisfies IR , IC , and RM with PoRM of at most ( log k + 1 ) · ( 2 + ln k ) .
We give the formal proof of Theorem 3 in Section 4 , and outline the mechanism here . mvpa partitions the participants into ( log k + 1 ) groups where each group g ∈ [ log k ] contains only the participants whose demands are in the range [ 2g−1 , 2g ) . mvpa selects winners only from one group . We round up the size of each participant in group g to 2g , thus we can have at most k 2g number of winners from the 1 ≥ . . . ≥ v(g ) group g . Let v(g ) p be the sorted valuations of all the participants in group g . We define the Max Possible Revenue of Group g ( mprg(g ) ) to be mprg(g ) = max j∈[k/2g ] j · v(g ) j
.
As the name of mprg(g ) suggests , its value captures the maximum revenue we can truthfully obtain from group g without violating revenue monotonicity . Let g∗ be the group with the highest mprg value and group g be the group whose mprg is second highest . The set of winners are the first j participants from group g∗ where j is the largest number in [ k/2g ] such that j · v(g∗ ) is greater than or equal mprg(g ) . We show that PoRM of mvpa is ( log k + 1 ) · ( 2 + ln k ) .

2 . PRELIMINARIES
Let N = {1 , . . . , n} be the set of all participants , and k be the number of identical items . We denote the type of participant i by θi = ( di , vi ) ∈ [ k ] × R+ , where di is the number of items participant i demands and vi is her valuation for getting di items . Note that the valuation of player i for getting less than di items is 0 . Now in the image text auction , participants have demand of either 1 or k . In the video pod auction participants can have arbitrary demands in {1 , . . . , k} . Lets denote the set of all possible types [ k ] × R+ by Θ and the set of all type profiles of n participants by Θn = Θ × . . . × Θ
. n
A deterministic mechanism M consists of an allocation rule x : Θn → 2n which maps each type profile to a subset of participants as the winners , and payment rule p : Θn →
,R+ n which maps each type profile to the payments of each
Let θ = ( θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θn ) ∈ Θn be a specific type profile . participant . Also let Aθ be the set of all feasible solutions , ie ,
S ⊆ Nfifi A ( denoted by wf(A ) ) is equal to
Aθ = i∈S
For each feasible solution A ∈ Aθ , the social welfare of θi∈A vi . To evaluate the social welfare of a mechanism M on a type profile θ , we compare the welfare of its solution to the optimal solution . di ≤ k
.
Definition 1 The welfare ratio of mechanism M = ( x , p ) on type profile θ ∈ Θn ( denoted by wfr(M , θ ) ) is the following .
Finally we prove the following theorem for video pod auc tions . wfr(M , θ ) = maxA∈Aθ wf(A ) wf(x(θ ) )
To capture the worst case loss in social welfare across all type profiles , we define the notion of price of revenuemonotonicity .
Definition 2 The Price of Revenue Monotonicity of a mechanism M ( denoted by PoRM(M ) ) is defined as follows :
PoRM(M ) = max θ∈Θn wfr(M , θ )
The desired goal is to design mechanisms which have low
PoRM value , where the best possible value is 1 .
Note that since we are interested in mechanisms with bounded PoRM , we restrict ourselves to mechanisms that satisfy consumer sovereignty . Consumer sovereignty says that any participant can be a winner as long as he bids high enough .
Now we will define a weakly monotone allocation rule which is used in the characterization of deterministic IC : Θn → {0 , 1} be the remechanisms . Let function xi striction of function x to participant i . Here xi( . ) is one if participant i is a winner and zero otherwise .
Definition 3 We call allocation function x is weakly monotone if for any type profile θ ∈ Θn and any participant i ∈ [ n ] with demand di , function xi ( (di , vi ) , θ−i ) is a nondecreasing function in vi .
Note that if a deterministic mechanism M satisfies consumer sovereignty and has a weakly monotone allocation function then function xi((di , vi ) , θ−i ) is a single step function . The value at which the function xi((di , vi ) , θ−i ) jumps from zero to one , ie the smallest value at which the participant i becomes a winner , is called critical value . Definition 4 Let M = ( x , p ) be a deterministic mechanism that satisfy consumer sovereignty and has a weakly monotone allocation function , the critical value of participant i in type profile θ is v∗ i = sup{vi|xi ( (di , vi ) , θ−i ) = 0} .
The following lemma characterizes deterministic IC mechanisms ( first given by [ 7] ) . We provide a proof sketch for the sake of completeness ( for a complete proof see eg [ 8] ) . Lemma 1 Let M = ( x , p ) be a mechanism which satisfies IR . Mechanism M is truthful ( IC ) if and only if the followings hold .
1 . x is weakly monotone .
2 . If participant i is a winner then its payment is its crit ical value ( v∗ i ) .
Proof . First we prove that if M is truthful then it satisfies both conditions 1 and 2 . We prove the first condition by contradiction . If x is not monotone then there exist participant i , type profile θ , and two values v(1 ) such that i wins in type profile but loses in type profile i > v(2 )

Consider an arbitrary participant i who is a winner , now we prove that the payment of participant i is its critical i value . Assume for contradiction that mechanism M charges participant i amount ci where ci < v∗ in a type profile ( (di , vi ) , θ−i ) . In this case , if participant i had type ( di , ˆvi ) where ci < ˆvi < v∗ i then i is not a winner in ( (di , ˆvi ) , θ−i ) as v∗ i is the critical value . Therefore , if the real type of participant i is ( di , ˆvi ) , she has incentive to lie her type as ( di , vi ) , become a winner , and pay ci . Hence , the payment cannot be less than v∗ i . Now suppose that there exists value vi for which mechanism M charges i amount ci which is more than v∗ i . In this case , if participant i had type ( di , ˆvi ) where v∗ i < ˆvi < ci then i is still a winner ( as v∗ is the critical value ) and pays at most ˆvi ( as M satisfies IR ) . Therefore , she has an incentive to lie her type as ( di , ˆvi ) , become a winner , and pay at most ˆvi . Hence , the payment cannot be more than v∗ i for any winning valuation vi . i
For the other direction , it is easy to check that any IR mechanism that satisfies conditions 1 and 2 is truthful .

IMAGE TEXT AUCTIONS
In this section we give our Mechanism for ImageText Auction ( mita ) which satisfies IR , IC , RM , and PoRM(mita ) ≤ ln k . Recall that in the image text auction we have k identical items to sell and there are two groups of participants : the ones who want all the k items which we call image participants ; and the ones who want only one item which we refer to as text participants . As a result there are also two possible types of outcome : mita gives all the items to an image participant ; or it gives an item to each member of a subset of the text participants .
We start with explaining why VCG fails to satisfy RM and how we address this issue in mita . Consider the type profile where we have one image participant with type ( k , 1 ) and one text participant with type ( 1 , 1 ) . In this case either of the participants can be the winner . The payment of the winner in VCG is her critical value which is one . However if we add one more text participant with the same type ( 1 , 1 ) , the two text participants win and each of them pay zero . The reason for the payment drop is that VCG always selects k winners from the text participants . This decreases the critical value of each text participant as the valuation of the other text participants helps her to win against image participants . In our mechanism we overcome this issue by not guaranteeing that the maximal number of text participants can win an item . In other words , in our mechanism it is possible that less than k text participants win an item even if there are more than k text participants . This way , intuitively , even if the number of text participants increase , it potentially creates more competition and hence increases the payments .
, p mita mita mita
Let θ be an arbitrary type profile where there are n1 textparticipants with types ( 1 , v1 ) , . . . , ( 1 , vn1 ) and n2 imageparticipants with types ( k , V1 ) , . . . , ( k , Vn2 ) . We define mechanism mita = ( x ) by giving allocation which is weakly monotone . Given the alfunction x location function , we obtain payment function p using the critical values defined in Lemma 1 which makes the mechanism truthful . Allocation rule of mita . Without loss of generality we assume that v1 ≥ v2 ≥ . . . ≥ vn1 and V1 ≥ V2 ≥ . . . ≥ Vn2 . Also , we assume that n1 ≥ k , if not , we add fake textparticipants with value 0 . For each j ∈ [ k ] we consider value j · vj . Let candidate set Cθ contains all the values mita j ∈ [ k ] such that j · vj is greater than or equal to V1 , ie , Cθ = {j ∈ [ k]|j · vj ≥ V1} . If Cθ is empty , the imageparticipant with type ( k , V1 ) wins . If Cθ is non empty then let j∗ be the maximum member of Cθ , ie , j∗ = maxj∈Cθ j . In this case the first j∗ text participants win .
Observation 1 Allocation function x tone . mita is weakly mono
Proof . Recall from Definition 3 , in order to prove that mita is weakly monotone , we have to show that for any x participant i ∈ [ n ] with demand di , function xi ( (di , vi ) , θ−i ) is a non decreasing function in vi . If i is an image participant then i wins if its valuation is larger than max(W , maxj∈[k ] j · vj ) where W is the largest valuation of the image participants in θ−i . Moreover , bidder i loses for any value smaller than or equal to max(W , maxj∈[k ] j · vj ) . Therefore xi is weakly monotone . 2 ≥ . . . be the sorted valuations of the text participants and V1 be the largest valuation of image participants in θ−i . Let t be the smallest value such that there exist j ∈ [ k − 1 ] where j+1 ≤ t ≤ v j and ( j + 1)· t is greater than or equal to V1 . If v the valuation of bidder i is larger than or equal to t then she wins since ( j + 1 ) · t ≥ V1 otherwise she does not win since t is the smallest value for which there exist j ∈ [ k − 1 ] such that ( j + 1 ) · t ≥ V1 . Therefore xi is weakly monotone .
If i is a text participant then let v
1 ≥ v mita
In the following lemma we obtain the critical value ( or using Lemma 1 . truthful payments ) of the winners in x The lemma also gives an intuition to why we select j∗ textparticipants to win , which is the maximum j such that j · vj ≥ V1 . Lemma 2 If Cθ , where Cθ = {j ∈ [ k]|j · vj ≥ V1} , is empty then the first image participant wins all the items with critical value max(V2 , maxj∈[k ] j · vj ) . If Cθ is not empty , the first j∗ text participants win the items where j∗ = maxj∈Cθ j and all of them have critical value max(vk+1 , V1 j∗ ) .
Proof . We find the critical value ( Definition 4 ) of a winner by showing that if she has any valuation larger than the critical value she wins and for any valuation less than the critical value she doesn’t .
If Cθ is empty then the first image participant ( with type ( k , V1 ) ) wins all the items . As long as V1 is larger than max(V2 , maxj∈[k ] j · vj ) participant ( k , V1 ) wins . If V1 is less than max(V2 , maxj∈[k ] j · vj ) then she loses to the imageparticipant ( k , V2 ) if max(V2 , maxj∈[k ] j·vj ) = V2 , or loses to the text participants if max(V2 , maxj∈[k ] j·vj ) = maxj∈[k ] j· vj . This means that the critical value of the first imageparticipant is max(V2 , maxj∈[k ] j · vj ) if she is the winner . If Cθ is non empty then the first j∗ text participants win . Let i ∈ [ j∗ ] be an arbitrary winner . First we observe that for any valuation v i greater than or equal to max(vk+1 , V1 j∗ ) , participant i remains as a winner in type profile θ = ( (1 , v i ) , θ−i ) . This is because for any such change in valuation of participant i number j∗ remains in set Cθ . Moreover , this change does not add any new number j to Cθ such that j > j∗ because the valuations of the textparticipants with index greater than j∗ are not changed in θ .
In order to prove that for any valuation v i less than critj∗ ) , participant i is not a winner we ical value max(vk+1 , V1 consider two cases : ( A ) when the critical value is equal to V1 j∗ , and ( B ) when the critical value is equal to vk+1 . i ) , θ−i ) . Because v
Case ( A ) : We prove this case by contradiction . Let v i be a valuation less than V1 j∗ for which participant i is in the set of winners in type profile θ = ( (1 , v i is less than V1 j∗ , the number of winners which contains participant i cannot be less than or equal to j∗ in type profile θ . Let j ∈ [ k ] which is greater than j∗ be the number of winners in θ . This means that there are at least j participants in θ . Note that all the whose valuation is larger than V1 j valuations in θ is the same as θ except vi which is decreased to v i , therefore , there are also at least j participants whose in θ and hence j is in set Cθ . valuation is larger than V1 j This contradicts with the fact that j∗ is the largest member of Cθ . j∗ ) = vk+1 which implies that k · vk+1 is larger than V1 as j∗ ∈ [ k ] . Therefore Case ( B ) can only happen when j∗ = k . Now consider participant i decreases its valuation to value v i that is less than vk+1 , then it cannot be a winner as there are k other participants whose valuations are more than v i while we have only k items . case ( B ) : In case ( B ) we have max(vk+1 , V1
The payment function of mita is set to the critical values of the winners as specified in Lemma 2 which by using Observation 1 and Lemma 1 implies mita satisfies IC . Moreover , as the payments are always less than the participants’ bid IR property of mita follows . Finally in the following lemma we show that mita is revenue monotone .
Lemma 3 Let θ be the type profile obtained by either increasing the valuation of a participant or adding a new participant then we have revenue(mita , θ ) ≥ revenue(mita , θ ) . to the type profile θ ,
Proof . Let v1 ≥ v2 ≥ . . . be the valuations of textparticipants and V1 ≥ V2 ≥ . . . be the valuations of image2 ≥ . . . be the valuparticipants in θ . Similarly let v 2 ≥ . . . be the valuations of text participants and V ations of image participants in θ . Note that for any i we have vi ≤ v i as we have one more participant or a higher valuation in θ . Let x be the new added participant or the participant which has higher valuation in θ . i and Vi ≤ V
1 ≥ v 1 ≥ V
We prove this lemma by considering the value of revenue(mita , θ ) for the case when text participants win and the case when an image participant wins . If an imageparticipant wins then it means that V1 > maxj∈[k ] j · vj and she pays max(V2 , maxj∈[k ] j · vj ) which is the total revenue . If text participants win then it means V1 ≤ maxj∈[k ] j · vj and there are j∗ winners where each of them pays max(vk+1 , V1 j∗ , then the total revj∗ ) = vk+1 , it implies that k · vk+1 enue is V1 . If max(vk+1 , V1 is larger than V1 . Remember that Cθ = {j ∈ [ k]|j · vj ≥ V1} and j∗ = maxj∈Cθ j therefore j∗ = k and hence the total payment of the winners is k · vk+1 . j∗ ) . If max(vk+1 , V1 j∗ ) = V1
In summary the total revenue for type profile θ is the following . revenue(mita , θ ) = max(V2 , maxj∈[k ] j · vj ) V1 > maxj∈[k ] j · vj ( A ) max(V1 , k · vk+1 ) V1 ≤ maxj∈[k ] j · vj ( B )
Similarly the total revenue for type profile θ is the following . revenue(mita , θ

( 4 ) If both revenue(mita , θ ) and revenue(mita , θ ) take their value from Case ( A ) then the proof of the lemma follows from Equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . Similarly if both revenue(mita , θ ) and revenue(mita , θ ) take their value from Case ( B ) then the proof of the lemma follows from Equations ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) . If revenue(mita , θ ) takes its value from Case ( A ) and revenue(mita , θ ) takes from Case ( B ) then it means that participant x is a text participant which causes maxj∈[k ] j·v j to be larger than V 1 .

If revenue(mita , θ ) takes its value from Case ( B ) and revenue(mita , θ ) takes from Case ( A ) then it means that participant x is an image participant . The following proves the theorem for this case . revenue(mita , θ ) = max(V1 , k · vk+1 ) < max j∈[k ] j · vj

In the above we proved that mita satisfies IR , IC , and RM . In the following theorem we bound the PoRM of mita and finish this section .
Theorem 4 PoRM(mita ) ≤ ln k .
Proof . Let A be the set of winner(s ) which realizes the maximum social welfare in type profile θ . If A contains only one image participant with valuation V1 then we also have V1 ≥ maxj∈[k ] j · vj . Mechanism mita also selects an imageparticipant with the same valuation if V1 > maxj∈[k ] j · vj and hence PoRM(mita ) is 1 . Otherwise we have V1 = maxj∈[k ] j · vj where mita selects a set of text participants which overall gives social welfare V1 and hence again the PoRM(mita ) is 1 .
Now we consider the case when A contains textparticipants . By adding enough dummy participants with value zero , and without loss of generality , we assume that set A contains the first k text participants with highest valuations v1 ≥ v2 ≥ . . . ≥ vk . Mechanism mita selects either the first j∗ text participants with highest valuations ( v1 ≥ v2 ≥ . . . ≥ vj∗ ) or selects an image participant with valuation V1 .

4 . VIDEO POD AUCTIONS
In this section we design a Mechanism for Video Pod Auction ( mvpa ) which satisfies IR , IC , and RM whose PoRM is at most ( log k + 1 ) · ( 2 + ln k ) . Note that all the log functions are in base 2 . Let θ = ( (d1 , v1 ) , . . . , ( dn , vn ) ) ∈ Θn be an arbitrary type profile of n participants . We define the allocation and payment function of mvpa for this type profile .
Mechanism mvpa partitions the participants into log k+ 1 groups G(1 ) , . . . , G(log k+1 ) where group G(g ) contains all the participants whose demand is in the range [ 2g−1 , 2g ) . Mechanism mvpa selects winners only from one group G(g ) . Definition 5 Let M ( g ) be equal to max( k 2g , 1 ) which is the maximum number of winners mvpa selects from group G(g ) .
Note that we can select at least k
2g winners from G(g ) since there are k items and the demand of each participant is at most 2g . Moreover , from the last group G(log k+1 ) we 2(log k+1 ) = 0 , can select at least one winner although since we assume the demand of all the participants are from the set [ k ] . Let ( d(g ) p ) be the types of all the participants in group g where p = |G(g)| . Here by adding enough dummy participants , we assume p is always larger than M ( g ) . Also , without loss of generality we assume 1 ≥ v(g ) v(g ) p . We define the Max Possible Revenue of Group g ( mprg(g ) ) to be the following .
2 ≥ . . . ≥ v(g )
1 ) , . . . , ( d(g )
1 , v(g ) p , v(g ) k mprg(g ) = max j∈[M ( g ) ] j · v(g ) j
As the name mprg suggests , we will see that its value captures the maximum revenue can be truthfully obtained from group g . Let G(g∗ ) be a group with the maximum mprg and G(g ) be a group with the second maximum mprg breaking the ties arbitrarily .
The set of winners selected by mvpa is
( d(g∗ )

, v(g∗ )

) , . . . , ( d(g∗ ) j
, v(g∗ ) j
) where j is the largest number in [ M ( g∗ ) ] for which j · v(g∗ ) is larger than or equal to mprg(g ) . In other words , the number of winners ( j ) is the largest number in [ M ( g∗ ) ] for which j · v(g∗ ) j ≥ mprg(g ) .
Now we use Lemma 1 to show that mvpa is truthful and j obtain the payments of winners .
Observation 2 Allocation function x monotone . mvpa is weakly
Proof . Note that mvpa sorts the participants according to their valuation and selects the first j participants . Therefore if any participant i increases its valuation it only helps her to enter the winning set . Hence , the observation follows .
In the rest of this section we drop the group identifier of M ( g∗ ) and simply use M unless it is about another group . In the following lemma we find the critical value of each winner i which is actually equal to its payment ( p mvpa i
) . mvpa
( θ ) contains the first j Lemma 4 Let set of winners x participants with highest valuations from G(g∗ ) and v(g∗ ) M +1 be the ( M + 1)th highest valuation in group G(g∗ ) which is zero if it does not exist . Then , the payment of participant i is the following . mvpa i p

, v(g∗ ) M +1 ) max( 0 i ∈ x i ∈ x mvpa mvpa

, v(g∗ ) mprg(g ) mprg(g )
Proof . If participant i is not a winner then its payment is zero . When participant i is a winner then we prove that its payment is equal to its critical value ( Definition 4 ) . In order to prove that value max( M +1 ) is the critical value of participant i , we show that for any value larger M +1 ) participant i still wins and for than max( any value less than it she loses .
Remember that v(g∗ )
2 ≥ . . . ≥ v(g∗ ) are the valuations of participants in group G(g∗ ) and v(g∗ ) , v(g∗ ) , . . . , v(g∗ ) are the valuations of the winners . Because group G(g∗ ) is the group with the maximum mprg , we have v(g∗ ) j ≥ mprg(g ) . As there can be at most M winners from group G(g∗ ) we have v(g∗ )
, v(g∗ ) 1 ≥ v(g∗ ) p

Let participant i with type profile ( d(g∗ )
) be the ith winner in group g∗ where i ∈ [ j ] . We show that for any val , v(g∗ ) M +1 ) paruation greater than or equal to max( ticipant i remains in the winning set . Equation ( 6 ) implies that there are j participants in group G(g∗ ) whose valuaM +1 ) . If we decrease tions are larger than max( mprg(g ) M +1 ) we the valuation of participant i to max( still have j participants in group G(g∗ ) with valuations at M +1 ) . Therefore , the value mprg(g∗ ) least max( will be at least mprg(g ) and group G(g∗ ) remains the winning group,‘ hence participant i remains in the winning set . Now we prove that if the valuation of participant i is less than the max( M +1 ) , she cannot be in the winning set . In order to prove this we consider two cases : ( A ) when max( M +1 , and ( B ) when mprg(g ) mprg(g )
, v(g∗ ) M +1 ) is equal to v(g∗ ) , v(g∗ ) mprg(g ) , v(g∗ ) M +1 ) = v(g∗ ) mprg(g ) mprg(g ) mprg(g ) , v(g∗ ) Case ( A ) : If max(
M +1 ) is equal to
, v(g∗ ) mprg(g ) mprg(g ) mprg(g )
M +1 ) =
M +1 and the valuation of participant i is less than v(g∗ ) M +1 then it means that there are M participants who have valuations greater than the valuation of participant i . As there can be at most M winners from group G(g∗ ) , participant i cannot be a winner . Case ( B ) : We prove this case by contradiction . and θ = be a type profile in which the valua
Suppose max( , v(g∗ ) ( d(g∗ ) tion of participant i is less than winner . Because the valuation of participant i ( v(g∗ ) ) is and i is in the winning set , in order for less than mprg(g∗ ) to be larger than mprg(g ) , there has to be more than j winners . Let j > j be the number of winners in θ . Having j winners in θ and in order for G(g∗ ) to be the group with the highest mprg we conclude that there are j . Note participants with valuation greater than that the only difference between θ and θ is that the valuation of participant i is higher in θ . Therefore , there are also mprg(g ) at least j participants with valuation greater than in θ . This contradicts with the way we select the number of winners ( j ) in θ which is the maximum number for which j · v(g∗ ) is larger than mprg(g ) . while she is still mprg(g ) mprg(g )
) , θ−i j j i i j j j j j j i j mvpa
The allocation function x is weakly monotone ( Observation 2 ) and the payments of the winners are their critical values ( Lemma 4 ) , therefore by Lemma 1 we conclude that mvpa satisfies IC .
In the rest of this section first we prove that mvpa satisfies
RM and then bound its PoRM .
Proposition 1 The total revenue of mechanism mvpa for type profile θ ( revenue(mvpa , θ ) ) is the following . ) , M · v(g∗ ) M +1 ) where g is a group with the second highest mprg . revenue(mvpa , θ ) = max(mprg(g j j j

Proof . From Lemma 4 we know that there are j winners and each of them pay max( M +1 ) . Therefore the sum of payments or the revenue of mvpa is j · M +1 ) . The proof of the proposition follows max( M +1 ) is equal to v(g∗ ) , v(g∗ ) if we show that when max( then the number of winners ( j ) is equal to M . , v(g∗ ) M +1 ) is equal to v(g∗ ) M +1 then as v(g∗ ) M +1 ≤ v(g∗ ) M , we have M · v(g∗ ) M ≥ mprg(g ) . Remember that j is the maximum number in the set [ M ] for which j · v(g∗ ) larger than mprg(g ) . Therefore j is equal to M . Lemma 5 Let θ be the type profile obtained by either adding a new participant or increasing the valuation of a participant in θ . Then ,
M +1 is j j j revenue(mvpa , θ
) ≥ revenue(mvpa , θ ) .
Proof . Let x be the new added participant or the participant which has the increased valuation in θ . Throughout the proof we show mprg of each group g in type profile θ by mprgθ(g ) and in type profile θ by mprgθ ( g ) . Similarly , we show the jth highest valuation of the participants of group g by v(g∗,θ ) in type profile θ . in type profile θ and by v(g∗,θ ) j j
As the jth highest valuation of the participants of each group can only increase by adding participant x , we conclude
∀g,∀j v(g,θ )

( 7 ) Remember that mprgθ of each group g is maxj∈[M ( g ) ] j ·

∀g mprgθ ( g ) ≥ mprgθ(g ) .

In order to prove this lemma we consider two cases : ( A ) adding participant x does not change the winning group G(g∗ ) , and ( B ) adding x changes the winning group . Case ( A ) : Let g be a group with the second highest mprg in θ , it is possible that g is equal to g . revenue(mvpa , θ

The following lemma which bounds PoRM of mvpa fin ishes this section . Theorem 5 PoRM(mita ) ≤ ( log k + 1 ) · ( 2 + ln k )
Proof . Let wf(g ) to be the maximum social welfare achievable if we select the winners only from group G(g ) . Let A be a set of winner(s ) which realizes the maximum welfare in type profile θ . Note that as there are log k + 1 groups , one group ( ˆg ) has a subset of participants from A wf(A ) whose social welfare is at least log k+1 and hence the following . wf(ˆg ) ≥ wf(A ) log k + 1
( 12 )
Now we prove the following claim about mprg(ˆg ) .
Claim 1 mprg(ˆg ) ≥ wf(ˆg )
2+ln k
Proof . Let B be the set of participants from group G(ˆg ) which give the maximum social welfare . Because the demands of all the participants of G(ˆg ) is in range [ 2ˆg−1 , 2ˆg ) , size of B is at most k/2ˆg−1 . Remember from Definition 5 that M ( ˆg ) = max(k/2(ˆg ) , 1 ) is the maximum number of winners that mvpa potentially selects from group G(ˆg ) . Therefore , we have |B| ≤ 2 · M ( ˆg ) + 1 .
Throughout the proof , we drop the superscript from M ( ˆg ) and simply refer to it as M . Let v1 ≥ v2 ≥ . . . ≥ v2·M +1 be the valuations of the participants in B ; if B has less than 2 · M + 1 participants we add enough dummy participants with valuations zero .

5 . LOWER BOUND
In this section we prove Theorem 2 . As mentioned earlier we need two additional mild assumptions of anonymity and independence of irrelevant alternatives ( which we define below ) on the class of mechanisms for which we prove our lower bound . Definition 6 A mechanism ( M = ( x , p ) ) is anonymous ( AM ) if the following holds : Suppose θ1 , θ2 ∈ Θn are two type profiles which are permutations of each other ( ie the set of type profiles are same just that the identities of participants to whom those types belongs are different ) . Say θ2 = π(θ1 ) . Also say x(θ1 ) = S1 and x(θ2 ) = S2 . Then S2 = π(S1 ) .
Definition 7 Let θ ∈ Θn be an arbitrary type profile and i ∈ N be an arbitrary participant with type θi = ( di , vi ) . A mechanism ( M = ( x , p ) ) satisfies Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives ( IIA ) if we decrease the bid of a losing participant , say participant i , to ˆvi < vi then the new set of winners is a super set of the previous one , ie , x(θ ) ⊆ x((di , ˆvi ) , θ−i ) . In other words , decreasing the bid of a losing participant does not hurt any winner .
,(1 , 1 − ) , ( 1 , 1
The proof outline of Theorem 2 is the following . Let M∗ = ( x∗ , p∗ ) be a mechanism which satisfies all the five properties and has the optimal PoRM opt ( ie , opt = PoRM(M∗) ) . We study the behavior of M∗ in a few type profiles . Let be an arbitrary small positive real value . First we show that when there are only two participants with types ( k , 1 ) and ( k , 1 + ) , M∗ gives all the k items to the participant with type ( k , 1 + ) . The revenue of M∗ from these two participants is 1 . Then , we add k more participants to create type profile θ = RM property requires M∗ to make at least the same revenue for θ . From this constraint we are able to show that M∗ assigns all the items to participant k + 2 with type ( k , 1 + ) and hence gets social welfare 1 + . Note that the maximum social welfare happens when the set of winners is i − k · ( see Definition 1 ) . Because PoRM(M∗ ) ≥ wfr(M∗ , θ ) for any First we study the behavior of M∗ when we have only two
{1 , . . . , k} which implies wfr(M∗ , θ ) ≥k θ ∈ Θn we conclude that opt ≥k k − ) , ( k , 1 ) , ( k , 1 + ) . The

1 participants with types ( k , 1 ) and ( k , 1 + ) . Lemma 6 Mechanism M∗ in type profile ( (k , 1 ) , ( k , 1 + ) ) gives all k items to the second participant and make one ie , x∗ ( (k , 1 ) , ( k , 1 + ) ) = {2} and unit of revenue , p∗ ( (k , 1 ) , ( k , 1 + ) ) = ( 0 , 1 ) .
Proof . First we study type profile ( (k , v1 ) , ( k , v2 ) ) for general values v1 , v2 ∈ R+ where v1 < v2 . We prove that M∗ gives all the items to the second participant . Claim 2 x∗ ( (k , v1 ) , ( k , v2 ) ) = {2} for any v1 , v2 ∈ R+ where v1 < v2 .
Proof . First note that M∗ has to have a winner for this type profile because otherwise its social welfare will be zero while the maximum social welfare is v2 . This makes the social welfare ratio of M∗ to be undefined . Now we prove that if x∗ ( (k , v1 ) , ( k , v2 ) ) = {1} then M∗ either violates IC or AM . Lets call type profile ( (k , v1 ) , ( k , v2 ) ) by θ(1 ) and suppose for the sake of contradiction x∗(θ(1 ) ) = {1} . From Lemma 1 we know that if participant 1 increases his bid to v2 she still wins , hence x∗(θ(2 ) ) = {1} where θ(2 ) = ( (k , v2 ) , ( k , v2) ) . Now if in type profile θ(2 ) participant 2 decrease his bid to v1 , again from Lemma 1 we conclude that she cannot win , ie , x∗(θ(3 ) ) = {1} where θ(3 ) = ( (k , v2 ) , ( k , v1) ) . Type profile θ(1 ) is θ(3 ) with participant 1 swapped with participant 2 but in both of them the first participant wins which contradicts with AM .
Claim 2 directly proves that the winner in type profile ( (k , 1 ) , ( k , 1 + ) ) is the second participant . The only thing remains is to show that her payment ( p2 ) is 1 . Note that payment p2 cannot be less than one because otherwise by Lemma 1 participant 2 wins all the items in type profile
The payment of participant j in θ(j−1 ) is at most its valj − . When we increase his bid to 1 − in uation which is 1 type profile θ(j ) its payment remains the same by Lemma 1 . Note that by construction of θ(j ) the valuation of all participants in {1 , . . . , j} is either zero or 1 − . If the valuation of them is 1 − and they are winner , by AM their payment j − . Therefore the total payments or revenue of M∗ in is 1 θ(j ) is at most j · ( 1 j − ) = 1 − j · since there is no other winner in set of participants {j + 1 , . . . , k} in type profile θ(j ) .
Note that type profile θ(j ) is obtained from type profile ( (k , 1 ) , ( k , 1 + ) ) by adding k more participants . However the revenue of θ(j ) is 1 − j · that is strictly less than 1 which is the revenue of ( (k , 1 ) , ( k , 1 + ) ) by Lemma 6 . This contradicts with the RM property of M∗ , hence M∗ has to assign the items to either participant k + 1 or k + 2 .
Now we show how from Lemma 7 we can derive Theorem 2 . Note that the maximum welfare for type profile
θ(0 ) = ,(1 , 1 − ) , ( 1 , 1 pants for which we get the total social welfarek k i − k· , i − k · . The denominator of Definition 1 is at most k − ) , ( k , 1 ) , ( k , 1 + ) realized when we give one item to each of the first k partici ie , the nominator of Definition 1 for this type profile is

( (k , 1 ) , ( k , p2 ) ) which contradicts with Claim 2 . Payment p2 cannot be larger than one because otherwise for any value 1 < v2 < p2 participant 2 wins all the items in type profile ( (k , 1 ) , ( k , v2) ) . This contradicts with Lemma 1 which states that the payment p2 is the smallest value for which participant 2 wins the items .
Now we add k more participants each of which wants only one item . In the following lemma we prove that RM forces M∗ to assign all of the items to one of the participants who want all the items .

Proof . We prove the lemma by contradiction that if M∗ assigns the items to a subset of the first k participants it satisfy be RM . We consider a class of k type profiles ( θ(1 ) , . . . , θ(k ) ) where θ(i ) is built from θ(i−1 ) . The only possible difference between θ(i ) and θ(i−1 ) is in the valuation of participant i . If participant i is a winner in θ(i−1 ) , then we obtain θ(i ) by increasing the valuation of the ith participant i − to 1 − . Note that the payment of participant i from 1 i − and in θ(i ) in θ(i−1 ) is at most her valuation which is 1 it remains the same by Lemma 1 . If participant i is not a winner in θ(i−1 ) then we obtain θ(i ) by decreasing his valuation to zero . Note that by IIA , no winner turns to a loser in θ(i ) . Let j ∈ {1 , . . . , k} be the largest number for which participant j is a winner in θ(j−1 ) and we increase his valuation to 1 − in θ(j ) . Note that at the start in type profile θ(0 ) the set of winners is a non empty subset of {1 , . . . , k} . Therefore there is at least one such j for which participant j is a winner in θ(j ) since decreasing the non winners valuation does not reduce the size of the winners . Now we prove that there is no winner in the set of participants {j + 1 , . . . , k} in type profile θ(j ) . Assume otherwise and let p ∈ {j + 1 , . . . , k} be the smallest number for which participant p is a winner in θ(j ) . Note that when we decrease the valuation of each participant j < p < p to zero to obtain θ(p ) , participant p remains as a winner in all of them by IIA . Therefore , participant p is a winner in type profile θ(p−1 ) and we increase his valuation in θ(p ) which contradicts with the fact that j is the largest number for which participant j is a winner in θ(j−1 ) .
