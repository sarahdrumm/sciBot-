ABSTRACT We discuss a comprehensive study exploring the impact of recommender systems when recommendations are forced to omit popular items ( short head ) and to use niche products only ( long tail ) . This is an interesting issue in domains , such as e tourism , where product availability is constrained , “ best sellers ” most popular items are the first ones to be consumed , and the short head may eventually become unavailable for recommendation purposes . Our work provides evidence that the effects resulting from item consumption may increase the utility of personalized recommendations .

INTRODUCTION A wide number of studies indicates that Recommender Systems ( RSs ) enforce the popularity of already popular items , favoring best selling or “ blockbuster ” products , which represent what we refer to as short head [ 2][6 ] . But what happens if the items in the short head become unavailable ? More specifically , what are the effects of RSs trained on popularity biased datasets ( datasets with a small number of very popular items , and a large number of much less popular items ) when recommendations are forced to use niche products in the long tail only ? This is an interesting issue in domains , such as e tourism , where products have constrained and variable capacity , ie , they can be consumed only by a limited number of users . As the first items to be consumed are those most popular , ie , the short head , recommendation algorithms must face situations in which eventually these items must be considered as “ missing ” . Previous researches considering the role of missing data in RSs focus on missing ratings and how to interpret them ( as a negative , positive or neutral user feedback ) when training [ 3 ] and evaluating [ 4 ] a recommender algorithms . These works assume that all of the items are potential candidates for recommendation . In this work our focus is on missing items : we assume that they are not missing at random , as they account for the “ short head ” , and they correspond to products that must be omitted by recommendations . 2 . EMPIRICAL STUDY We carried on a vast empirical study in the online hotel booking domain which involved 382 users and focused on the effects of

We implemented a full sized simulation of a hotel booking service called PoliVenus , developed a predictive model for short head construction , and measured the quality different recommenders and in different conditions of items availability . PoliVenus is a web based framework that can be configured to perform controlled experiments . It implements the same layout and functionality of the portal of Venere.com ( a company of the Expedia group ) except payment . Venere.com made us available a catalog of approx . 3,000 hotels and 72,000 related users’ reviews which we integrated with reviews extracted from TripAdvisor . Recommendations quality is defined in terms of subjective and objective variables . Subjective variables ( eg , satisfaction  the perceived quality/value of the reserved hotel ) were measured using a web based questionnaire based on the ResQue model [ 4 ] . Objective variables ( eg , average hotel cost per night for the reserved hotel , average task execution time , average number of explored hotels ) were assessed using interaction log data . Quality variables are measured under 6 different experimental conditions , defined by the combination of two manipulated variables : recommendation algorithm and hotels availability . Our study considers three algorithms : ( i ) Editorial is the non personalized , marketing based ranking strategy adopted by Venere.com ; ( ii ) Popular ranks hotels based on the shrank average rating defined later in the section , and ( iii ) Hybrid interleaves the results from a collaborative filtering and a content based algorithm . For hotel availability we consider two possible values : low season ( ie , with full availability of hotels ) and high season ( without short head because the best hotels are fully booked ) . Experience tells us that hotels which are the best in the users’ opinion are the first to be reserved and to become unavailable in high season . Users’ opinion is influenced by a number of factors , the predominant being others’ opinion , manifested for example in online reviews , in terms of amount and average score of ratings . The two metrics are not necessarily correlated , as low popularity may come along with a high hotel rating and vice versa . To overcome this ambiguity , we rank hotels according to the shrank average where µi is the average rating of item i and k is a shrink constant that controls the support of the estimation . For k = 0 hotels are ranked according to the traditional definition of average rating . For k → ∞ hotels are ranked according to their popularity . By setting a threshold on the shrank rating we can classify the hotels in two classes : the short head containing topmost hotels in the ranked list and the long tail containing the remaining ones . In our experiments we have simulated an occupancy of 50 % ( ie , we assume 50 % of hotels are fully booked ) and we have used k = 10 for the shrank rating . Study participants aged between 20 and 40 , had some familiarity with the use of the Web and had never used Venere.com before the study . They were randomly assigned to one of the six experimental conditions and were asked to make a hotel reservation for 2 nights in a specific period . rating ( cid:4666)(cid:2020)(cid:3397)(cid:1863)(cid:4667)(cid:4666)(cid:3397)(cid:1863)(cid:4667 )

3 . RESULTS Analysis of variance suggests that algorithm and hotel availability have a significant impact on all quality variables . Concerning satisfaction , non personalized recommendations are the most satisfied in the low season condition ( Figure 1.a ) : 90 % of positive answers to satisfaction questions , in line with other studies showing that popularity based recommenders do better or just as well as personalized ones . In all 3 high season conditions ( Figure 1.b ) , users are overall less satisfied than in low season , being obviously disappointed by the limited offer of products . While satisfaction of users receiving Editorial and Popular recommendations decreases of about 50 % in high season , it remains stable in users receiving personalized recommendations , who are now the most satisfied ( 70% ) . There is a statistically significant negative correlation between satisfaction and average price of reserved hotels . In low season ( Figure 2.a ) users with Popular recommendations are more satisfied and spend significantly less ( 100 € vs . 150 € in average per night ) than users with Editorial recommendations . In high season , when most hotels are fully booked and costs are higher , the average price of booked hotels increases by more than 50 % with the Editorial and Popular recommendations ( Figure 2.b ) , while it does not significantly differ for users’ with personalized recommendations . Data concerning task execution time confirms the intuition that searching for hotels in low season takes less time ( Figure 3 ) than in the high season period when the decision making process is more complex . Less intuitively , users who invested more time on the decision process in both conditions of hotel availability are the most satisfied . Data concerning another measure of effort  number of explored hotels  confirm this phenomenon : users who explore the largest number of hotels are those with Popular recommendations season and with personalized recommendations in high season . low in that large amount of rely on other persuasion criteria
4 . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The low season condition when all items are available is comparable to situations of potentially unlimited capacity that characterize most domains considered by RS research ( eg , movies ) . Hence our results on satisfaction in low season are in line with prior findings ( eg[1 ] ) pinpointing that the perceived quality of non personalized algorithms is comparable to the one of personalized algorithms . When a items potentially satisfy the specified characteristics , the opinion of the crowd is strongly influential on the decision making process . Hence popularity biased algorithms are more appreciated than algorithms like personalization and suggest products less in line with the most popular ones . In contrast , scarcity of resources improves the relative quality of personalized recommendations : they are more appreciated than popularity based recommendations . When the most popular solutions are gone ( missing short head/high season condition ) , available items are in the long tail , have few user ratings and tend to be “ below threshold ” and indistinguishable from one another with respect to popularity . Other product qualities become important such as the match between product characteristics and personal needs , hence personalized algorithms , which are unbiased by popularity , increase their persuasion strength . When using personalized recommendations it is also interesting to notice that the average cost of reserved hotels is not affected by the scarcity of items , remaining stable in the two availability conditions : missing the most popular items in the short head , users are forced to spend more effort in search ( exploring more items and digging more deeply into product features ) and seem to become more conscious of alternative offers , and more able to discover hotels at reasonable prices . In summary , our study shows that product consumption and unavailability of short head items weakens the performance of popularity based recommenders while enforcing the benefits of personalized recommendations . These results , although deserving further validation studies , may suggest reflections for the design of future recommender systems . 5 .
