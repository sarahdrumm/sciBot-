ABSTRACT Given a number of possible sub intents ( also called subtopics ) for a certain query and their corresponding search results , diversified search aims to return a single result list that could satisfy as many users' intents as possible . Previous studies have demonstrated that finding the optimal solution for diversified search is NP hard . Therefore , several algorithms have been proposed to obtain a local optimal ranking with greedy approximations . In this paper , a pruned exhaustive search algorithm is proposed to decrease the complexity of the optimal search for the diversified search problem . Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can decrease the computation complexity of exhaustive search without any performance loss .

1 , List 2 and List 3 in terms of a certain diversity metric . If a document dk is added at the l th slot of List 2 , the total score change of the list may be divided into two parts . The first part of the score change is from dk itself because no document exists in the l th slot of List 2 before dk is added to this position . We denote the score for dk in the l th slot as Gkl . The second part of the score change results from the documents after the l th slot . If dk is not relevant to any subtopic covered by the documents after dk , dk will not affect the second part of the score change . If dk is relevant to any subtopic covered by any document after dk , the score of the second part will decrease . We denote the absolute value of this score decrement as Akl . Because List 2 in Figure 1 has two "empty" slots at the l th and k th slots ( l<k ) , we can further divide the score decrement Akl into two subparts : the first subpart of the decrement stems from the documents between the lth slot and the k th slot , and the second subpart is from the documents after the k th slot ( the k th slot in List 2 is empty ) . We denote their absolute values as Ikl and Bkl , respectively .
1 . INTRODUCTION
Diversified search aims to produce a search result list which could meet the information needs for ambiguous or underspecified queries [ 1 ] . However , since search result diversification was proven to be a computational expensive problem [ 2 ] , it is almost impossible to generate an ideal diversified ranking list for commercial search engines . Several greedy search algorithms such as IA Select [ 3 ] were therefore proposed to find an approximation for the ideal diversified ranking list . In this paper , supposing that ( 1 ) subtopics and their weights underlying a query are known , and ( 2 ) the relevance between the document and subtopics are available , we propose a pruned exhaustive search algorithm for search result diversification to decrease the computation complexity of the exhaustive search without losing any performance . 2 . PRUNED EXHAUSTIVE SEARCH
To better describe our algorithm , we first define some symbols in use . Figure 1 shows three different result lists that are composed of the ranked results . The symbol dl in these lists is used to distinguish a certain document from other documents . It does not stand for the document ranks at the l th slot of the list . The only difference between List 1 and List 2 is that List 2 contains no documents in either the l th or the k th slots ( l<k ) . List 3 is the same with List 1 except that we exchange dl with dk . Sc1 , Sc2 and Sc3 in Figure 1 respectively represent the evaluation scores of List

( 1 ) Next , the document list containing dl in its l th slot and dk in its kth slot cannot be the optimal diversified search result . Proof : We prove this theorem by contradiction . Let us assume there exist dl and dk that satisfy Formula ( 1 ) and that a document list containing this document pair can be the optimal diversified search result . Let us also assume that List 1 shown in Figure 1 is one optimal result , where dl is in the l th slot and dk is in the k th slot . To imply contradiction , it is only necessary to exchange these two documents , which results in List 3 in Figure 1 .

Because Bll , Bkk , Bkl and Blk represent the decrements derived from the documents after the k th slot and are only a function of subtopic coverage ( in diversity evaluation , the existing measures only take the current subtopic coverage into account as the influence derived from previous documents when assessing a document ) , we obtain : Bll+Bkk=Bkl+Blk . k=l+1 means there is no document between the l th slot and the k th slot . Therefore , we obtain Ikl=0 . Then we subtract Sc1 from Sc3 :
( 2 ) Formula ( 2 ) shows Sc3>Sc1 , which means that List 3 is a better result than List 1 . This is in contradiction to the assumption that List 1 is one of the optimal results . Therefore , lists containing document pairs that satisfy Formula ( 2 ) could not be the optimal result . ■ THEOREM 1 shows that when performing an exhaustive search , we can simultaneously determine whether Formula ( 1 ) is satisfied . If Formula ( 1 ) is satisfied , we can stop searching the current branch and continue searching the next branch . Therefore , we can propose an algorithm to prune the branches that must not achieve the optimal solution when performing the exhaustive search .

To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm , we collect all the subtopics submitted in the subtopic mining tasks of NTCIRs 9 and 10 . Based on the metric α nDCG [ 4 ] , we generated the diversified search results using Algorithm 1 for each query . Altogether 200 Chinese queries and 50 English queries in the subtopic mining tasks are used . We take the subtopics submitted by different participants as different query instances because they are mined using different methods . Totally 18 Chinese runs and 29 English runs are submitted , which respectively comprises of subtopics mined for the 200 Chinese queries and the 50 English queries . Therefore , in total we obtain 200*18=3,600 Chinese query instances and 50*29=1,450 English query instances . The experimental results are compared to the exhaustive search results . However , it is difficult to search for the optimal result when a large number of documents are selected for exhaustive search . Therefore , we change the number of selected documents from 2 to 5 to construct the diversified search experiments .
3.2 Experiment Results .
With THEOREM 1 we can see that the proposed algorithm could obtain optimal ranking lists with respect to a given evaluation metric . By investigating into the percentages of queries from different datasets that obtain the optimal results using Algorithm 1 , we find that Algorithm 1 obtains the optimal results for both the 3,800 Chinese queries and the 1,450 English queries , which means that Algorithm 1 perform lossless pruning on all the query instances .
Table 1 presents the corresponding time costs of the experiments . It shows that by pruning the useless search branches in the exhaustive search , Algorithm 1 decreases the time cost of the exhaustive search . The larger the number of selected documents is , the larger the decrement of the time cost is . Table 1 The logarithm of the time costs of different algorithms . The values of columns 3 6 are the log(t)s with the number of selected documents changing from 2 to 5 .

The efficiency of our proposed algorithm is proved to be higher than the unpruned exhaustive search in the experimental studies .
