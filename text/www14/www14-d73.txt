ABSTRACT Micro blogging is experiencing fantastic success in the worldwide . However , during its rapid development , it has encountered the problem of information overload , which has troubled many users . In this paper , we mainly focus on the task of tweet recommendation to address this problem . We extend the session based temporal graph ( STG ) approach as Topic STG for tweet recommendation which comprehensively considers three types of features in Twitter : the textual information , the time factor , and the users’ behavior . The experimental results conducted on a real dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach .

INTRODUCTION
Twitter and other micro blogging systems not only act as the role of social relation between people , but also as important sources for people to obtain useful information . Currently , there are more than 200 million messages generated on Twitter each day . This scale of data benefits to users while floods them with huge volumes of noise , and thus puts them at risk of information overload . Currently , researchers mainly employ the content features , user relationships as well as interactions to build user interest model for tweet recommendation . However , most of them have not taken into account the effect of the time factor . We have observed that users’ behaviors on Twitter are determined by both long term and short term interests , a similar scenario described in [ 1 ] . In other words , users’ interest may change with time . Moreover , a considerable part of tweets are time sensitive ( eg a tweet about “ WWW 2014 ” ) . As

Xiang et al [ 2 ] proposed a novel recommendation approach named session based temporal graph ( STG ) . As shown at the bottom part of Figure 1 , STG is a bipartite graph with three types of nodes : user node , item node , and sessionnode . The session node is a combined node of a user and a specific time bin , i.e , S1(U1 , t1 ) . The data for temporal recommendation is converted into the following form : <user , item> and <session , item> , where the former represents the long term interests and the latter indicates the shortterm interest . Every edge has a weight in STG . Finally , the authors transformed the recommendation problem into calculating the sum of the scores of the shortest paths between corresponding nodes .
Figure 1 : An example of Topic STG .
Although STG based approach has been proved to be significantly effective on most kinds of datasets , it is still not suitable to the tweet recommendation task for two reasons : firstly , the original STG approach neglects the textual information of tweets , which presents rich sentiment information to predict user preference in Twitter ; secondly , STG only recommends those “ previous visited ” tweets , however , our task is to recommend those potential tweets that a user may be interested in . As a result , we propose an extended approach called Topic STG , which can bridge STG and textual information via adding “ topic node ” into the existing bipartite graph . 2 . TOPIC STG RECOMMENDATION
As the same with STG approach , once a user U1 operates on a tweet T w1 ( i.e , “ retweet ” , “ comment ” , or “ favorite ” ) ,

U two pairs of edges ( E1 E4 ) will be created . The difference is that the topic node will be automatically generated by LDA ( Latent Dirichlet Allocation ) . We train the latent topics to infer tweets’ topic distribution , long term topic distribution and short term topic distribution of users , and the correspondingly topic related edges will be created , i.e , E5 E10 . With the new added edges and their weights ( expressed in Table 1 ) , we are able to recommend candidate tweets to a user U at a timestamp t based on the following steps :
1 . Select the corresponding user node and session node as the source nodes .
2 . Use breadth first strategy ( BFS ) to search the shortest paths between the source nodes and the candidate tweetnodes . There exist 10 types of shortest paths comparing with STG approach : P1 : U! I ! U! I ; P2 : U! I ! S! I ; P3 : S! I ! U! I ; P4 : S! I ! S! I ; P5 : U! I ! T! I ; P6 : S! I ! T! I ; P7 : U! T ! S! I ; P8 : S! T ! U! I ; P9 : U! T ! U! I ; P10 : S! T ! S! I , where P1 P4 are the same as the STG approach , and the other paths are new added ones . Obviously , P5 , P6 are calculated by the content based recommendation approach , and P7P10 are calculated by the user based collaborative filtering approach .

3 . The score of each path ϕ(P ) = vk2p w(vk , vk+1)γ(v0 ) , where γ(v0 ) is an indicator for the influence of different starting points . γ(v0 ) = β if v0 = vU , and γ(v0 ) = 1 , β if ∑ v0 = vS .
4 . The preference of U on T w is computed as pT w U = P2P ( U;T w ) ϕ(P ) , where P ( U , T w ) represents the set of the shortest paths between U and T w .
5 . Finally , we choose the top N tweets with the highest pT w U as our recommendation results . The complexity of the BFS is O(e v ) , where e and v are the number of edges and vertexes respectively . Actually , we can utilize some pruning strategies to improve the performance .
3 . EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
We crawled a dataset from Twitter which includes 14,023 users and 271,695 tweets from 20/04/2013 to 22/05/2013 .
Those inactive accounts and spammers are filtered to get a dense dataset with 8,923 users and 37,226 tweets . For each user in the dataset , the latest tweet operated by the user is selected as the test data , the other tweets are used as the training data . Another 110,361 randomly selected tweets are collected to train an LDA topic model with 100 topics . As for the parameters in Topic STG , we set the size of the time window as one day and β = 0.4 through heuristic learning approach . We employ the Hit Ratio ( HR ) metric [ 2 ] to evaluate the performance of our method , which indicates how many tweets appears in the recommendation list R(U , t ) for each user U at time t . Moreover , two baselines are compared to evaluate the effectiveness of the Topic STG approach [ 2 ] . One is the original STG approach , and the other is the approach introduced in [ 3 ] , which mainly utilizes textual feature to recommend tweets .
Figure 2 : The HR with different approaches and topics .
As illustrated in Figure 2(a ) . HR is positively correlated with the length N of the recommendation list . The HR values of three approaches are very close when N is set to 30 . Moreover , the Topic STG outperforms the baselines when N 2 [ 10 , 25 ] . Also the recommended tweets would get better rank positions in the list generated by TopicSTG . The number of topics would also influence HR . As shown in Figure 2(b ) , the performance of Topic STG tends to be stable when N um(T opic ) 2 [ 80 , 150 ] , which means we can set N um(T opic ) to an arbitrary value in [ 80,150 ] . However , we should note that the complexity of Topic STG will increase as we add more topics , so we decide to set N um(T opic ) = 80 . In summary , the new added topic nodes play an important role to optimize the recommendation results . In the future , we aim to present a parallel version of Topic STG to improve its performance .
