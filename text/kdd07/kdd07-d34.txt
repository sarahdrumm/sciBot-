ABSTRACT In this paper we address the problem of detecting topics in large scale linked document collections . Recently , topic detection has become a very active area of research due to its utility for information navigation , trend analysis , and highlevel description of data . We present a unique approach that uses the correlation between the distribution of a term that represents a topic and the link distribution in the citation graph where the nodes are limited to the documents containing the term . This tight coupling between term and graph analysis is distinguished from other approaches such as those that focus on language models . We develop a topic score measure for each term , using the likelihood ratio of binary hypotheses based on a probabilistic description of graph connectivity . Our approach is based on the intuition that if a term is relevant to a topic , the documents containing the term have denser connectivity than a random selection of documents . We extend our algorithm to detect a topic represented by a set of terms , using the intuition that if the co occurrence of terms represents a new topic , the citation pattern should exhibit the synergistic effect . We test our algorithm on two electronic research literature collections , arXiv and Citeseer . Our evaluation shows that the approach is effective and reveals some novel aspects of topic detection .

INTRODUCTION
The availability of large scale linked document collections such as the Web and specialized research literature archives[6 , 3 ] presents new opportunities to mine deep knowledge about the community activities behind the document collections . Topic discovery is one example of such knowledge mining that has recently attracted considerable research interest [ 12 , 14 , 9 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 17 , 4 , 16 , 7 , 15 ] . Topics are semantic units that can function as basic building blocks of knowledge discovery . Once discovered they can be used in a number of ways including information navigation , trend analysis , and high level descrption of data [ 22 , 15 ] .
In this paper , we present a unique approach to topic detection that uses the correlation between the distribution of terms representing a topic and the distribution of links in the citation graph among the documents containing these terms . This distinguishes our work from other approaches to topic detection that focus on textual data alone [ 9 , 22 , 23 , 14 ] or which detect topics and communities by studying graph properties without considering text features [ 10 , 19 , 11 , 20 ] . Our appoach is based on the intuition that documents related to a topic should be more densely connected in the citation graph than a random selection of documents are connected in the citation graph . We therefore extract topics from the corpus by examining the structure of the term citation graph for each term in the corpus . A term citation graph of a term A is a subgraph of the full citation graph restricted to the documents that contain the term A and the edges between these term specific nodes . If the term citation graph of a term A shows denser connectivity than a random subgraph of the full citation graph , it is likely that the term A represents a topic .
An illustration of our approach to topic detection is as follows . Let ’s imagine that we have a set of all documents containing a term α : for example “ sensor network ” or “ association rule mining ” . Intuitively , if α represents a topic , then the documents containing this term will be interconnected in a relatively dense citation network ( Figure 1 . a ) ) . This contrasts with another term η , for example “ practical examples ” or “ six months ” , that are non topic terms ( ie , general terms ) for which the citation links among containing documents will be relatively sparse ( Figure 1 . b ) ) . The notions of “ dense ” and “ sparse ” connectivity are relative to the connectivity of a citation graph consisting of a random selection of documents and their citation edges from the full citation graph .
We develop topic score measures that are log odds ratios of binary hypotheses based on a probabilistic description of graph connectivity . For each term in the corpus , we take a look at its term citation graph . Our topic score measure tells , with statistical confidence , whether the connectivity of the term citation graph is significantly denser than what is expected from the citation graph of a random selection of documents . As a first approximation , we assume that a topic can be represented by a single term . We then extend our algorithm to detect topics that are not represented by a single term , but by the relation of a set of terms .
We test our algorithms on two electronic research literature collections , arXiv and Citeseer . Our experiments produce a ranked list of terms that on examination by field experts and based on our observations match prevailing topics in the corpus . Our evaluation of the lists uncovers a number of interesting characteristics of the lists of terms , including the discovery of topics in varying scale , the prevalence and specificity of topics , and the time evolution of topics .
This paper is structured as follows . Section 2 and Section 3 present our algorithm to detect topics represented by a single term and by a set of terms , respectively . Section 4 shows the results obtained by applying the algorithm to arXiv and to Citeseer . Section 5 reviews the related work . Section 6 discusses a few issues raised in the work . Section 7 concludes .
2 . DETECTING TOPICS IN LINKED
TEXTUAL CORPUS
The problem statement of this paper is “ How do we detect topics in a linked textual corpus , such as a collection of research papers ? ” . We address this research problem by producing a ranked list of terms where terms are ordered according to how likely a term represents a topic and how significant the topic represented by a term is . To accomplish this goal , we look at the citation graph of the corpus at the resolution of an individual term level .
Definition 1 . In this paper , a “ term ” is defined as an ngram phrase that consists of any n consecutive words from a document , where n is any positive integer . For example , “ network ” , “ for the ” , “ association rule mining ” are all valid examples of a term .
Conventionally , the citation graph of a corpus is a directed graph with nodes being the documents or research papers in the corpus , and with edges being the hyperlinks or the citation links . In this paper , we only consider the undirected version of the citation graph . We denote the undirected citation graph of the entire corpus as Gall .
The term citation graph of a term A , GA , refers to a subgraph of the entire citation graph Gall with nodes restricted to the documents that contain the term A and the links between these documents . Precisely ,
Definition 2 . GA , the term citation graph of a term A , is defined by
V ( GA ) = {d|document d contains a term A , d ∈ V ( Gall)} E ( GA ) = {e ( di , dj ) |di , dj ∈ V ( GA ) , e ( di , dj ) ∈ E ( Gall)} a )

Given a term , we want to make a binary decision with statistical confidence about whether the term is relevant to a topic or not . We use the following intuition . If a term represents a topic , then the document nodes in its term citation graph will be well connected by citations . On the other hand , if a term does not represent a topic , the documents in its term citation graph are not related to each other , thus their distribution is random with respect to citation patterns . Figure 1 shows this intuition . Figure 1 a ) is the term citation graph for a topic term α showing dense connectivity . Figure 1 b ) is the term citation graph of a non topic term η showing sparse connectivity comparable to that of a random selection of documents .
We formalize this notion by setting up two hypotheses . Given a term A , hypothesis H1 says that A is relevant to a topic , and hypothesis H0 says A is not . We make an observation O ( GA ) about the connectivity of the term citation graph of A , GA . We compute the loglikelihood of the observation O ( GA ) under hypothesis H1 and the loglikelihood of O ( GA ) under hypothesis H0 . The difference of the two loglikelihoods becomes the topic score for the term A .
TopicScore ( A ) = log ( P ( O ( GA ) |H1 ) ) − log ( P ( O ( GA ) |H0 ) )
= log„ P ( O ( GA ) |H1 ) P ( O ( GA ) |H0)«
( 1 )
The topic score represents how well hypothesis H1 explains the connectivity observation , compared to hypothesis H0 .
We take the observation O ( GA ) to indicate , for each node in GA , whether the node has at least one link to the rest of the graph or not . Under hypothesis H1 , it is very likely that a node in the graph is connected to the rest of the graph by at least one link . The document either cites or is cited by another document that shares the topic . We use the parameter pc , with a value close to 1 , to denote this probability of a node in GA having at least one link to any other node in GA . We present the result with pc set to 0.9 in Section 4 . 1 Then , the loglikelihood of O ( GA ) with where V ( G ) denotes the set of vertices in G , E ( G ) denotes the set of edges in G , and e ( di , dj ) is an edge between the nodes di and dj .
1Our experiment with several values of pc shows that the result is not sensitive to a particular choice of values for pc , as long as the value is close to 1 .
It should be noted that our null hypothesis H0 is based on the randomness of the citation connectivity , not on the absolute sparseness of the connectivity . This enables our topic score to effectively filter out high frequency common phrases as non topic terms . This is illustrated in Figure 2 . 2 Figure 2 a ) shows the term citation graph derived from arXiv for a prevalent topic term “ black hole ” and Figure 2 b ) for a stop phrase “ we show ” . As shown , it is not easy to discern from the graph visualization that the topic relevance of “ black hole ” is much greater than that of “ we show ” . However , as will be seen in Section 4 , our topic score measure assigns the highest score to “ black hole ” , and the lowest score to “ we show ” . This is because , for the term “ we show ” , the random connectivity assumption of the null hypothesis H0 defaults to the dense connectivity as shown in Figure 2 b ) , while the hypothesis H1 assumes even denser connnectivity .
If we generate the topic scores in Eq 1 for all possible terms in the corpus and order them , we get a ranked list of terms , where terms are ranked according to how likely they represent the topics of the corpus . The terms at the top ranks are the terms representing the topics prevalent in large scale . This is because the term citation graphs of the topics prevalent in large scale have many instances of per node observations that support the hypothesis H1 over H0 .
As hinted above , the bottommost ranked terms have clear intuitive interpretation as well . These terms are the stop words or common phrases , as their term citation graphs exhibit the large scale statistical evidence that can be better explained by H0 than by H1 .
3 . DETECTING TOPICS REPRESENTED BY
A SET OF TERMS
Some topics are not detectable by a single term but by the appearance of a set of terms . This may occur , for example , when a new term is not coined for a topic , but the topic is represented by the relation between a few general terms . For example , let ’s consider a topic M represented by the co occurrence of two terms “ quantum computer ” and “ quantum dot ” . This is a research topic in physics about using “ quantum dot ” as a hardware device for “ quantum computer ” . However , each individual term “ quantum dot ” or “ quantum computer ” represents a much broader research topic than the given topic M . The term “ quantum computer ” represents any topic related to quantum computing : examples are quantum computer algorithms , fault tolerant quantum computing , and many kinds of hardware devices for quantum computer . “ quantum dot ” is a nano scale semiconductor material . The term “ quantum dot ” represents a broad research topic including material property study , and using quantum dot to make applications such as laser , quantum computer logic gate , etc . Thus , looking at a single term is not going to reveal the topic M .
The problem of detecting a topic represented by a set of
2 To aid the visualization , the term citation graphs from arXiv are illustrated in the following ways . The vertical axis is a time scale where time follows downward . The horizontal axis spans 7 research fields of arXiv . A paper at a particular time and a field is placed in the small rectangle at the corresponding position . The darkness of a rectangle represents the number of papers contained in the rectangle . The links between rectangles are the citation links between the papers in the rectangles .
Figure 2 : The term citation graphs from arXiv . a ) for a topic term “ black hole ” , b ) for a stop phrase “ we show ” hypothesis H1 is given as follows . log ( P ( O ( GA ) |H1 ) )
P ( Oi ( GA ) |H1)! log ( P ( Oi ( GA ) |H1 ) )
= log Yi =Xi
= nc,A log ( pc ) + ( nA − nc,A ) log ( 1 − pc )
( 2 ) where nA is the number of nodes in GA , and nc,A is the number of nodes in GA that have at least one link that points to another node within GA , and Oi ( GA ) is the pernode observation for node i .
The loglikelihood of O ( GA ) with hypothesis H0 is more interesting . Under the null hypothesis H0 that a term A is not relevant to a topic , the documents in GA are not related to each other . Thus , given a node i in GA and one of its citation links , the probability that the other end of this link points to any node within GA is nA−1 N −1 , where nA is the number of nodes in GA and N is the number of nodes in the entire corpus . That is , determining which node a citation link of a node i connects to can be considered as a random process with respect to GA , where any node in the entire corpus is equally likely to be the destination of the link . Then , the probability that a node i in GA is connected to any other nodes in GA by at least one link is given as ,
N −1 ” li 1 − “ 1 − nA −1 node i .

Figure 3 : The term citation graphs of terms α and β , and their intersection terms but not by an individual term is different from finding the co occurrence counts of terms . The mere high count of co occurrence is not what we want . The co occurrence count of two stop words might be high , but it does not carry topic information . Also , the normalized co occurrence , defined as the co occurrence count divided by the occurrence count of a single term , is not what we want either . At the extreme , we may think of terms A and B that always occur together with high frequency . But this topic is detectable by looking at a single term A or B by the method explained in Section 2 . Finally , it should be noted that our goal is different from association rule mining [ 1 ] : the above example of terms A and B co occurring with high frequency qualifies for an association rule , but not for detecting a topic represented by a set of terms . Then , how do we detect topics represented by a set of terms ?
We again look at the term citation graphs and use the following intuition that is illustrated in Figure 3 . In Figure 3 , a small rectangle containing α is a document containing a term α . Similarly , a small rectangle containing β is a document containing a term β . A small rectangle containing both α and β is a document containing both terms . A link connecting two documents is a citation link . The left big circle encloses the term citation graph of the term α , which is Gα . The right big circle encloses Gβ . The documents and links within the intersection of the two circles constitute the citation graph for the documents containing both terms , which we denote as Gα∩β . Figure 3 shows that the documents containing both terms α and β are significantly more densely connected than Gα or Gβ . This indicates that there is a nontrivial topic represented by the co occurrence of α and β , but not by one of them . On the other hand , if there is no significant topic represented by the marriage of α and β then the occurrence of the term β within Gα or the occurrence of the term α within Gβ will not be correlated to the citation pattern . In this case , Gα∩β should have the link connectivity comparable to that of the same size random subgraph of Gα or Gβ .
We formalize this notion as follows . Given a term A and a term B , we want to detect whether the connectivity of GA∩B is significantly higher than what we could normally expect from the connectivity of GA or GB . To account for the connectivity of any term citation graph G , we use an observation 3 that considers , for each citation link of each node
3Note that this observation O(G ) is different from the ob in G , whether the link ends with a node within G or outside G . If for each link of a node in G the probability that it ends with another node within G is p , then the loglikelihood of the connectivity observation on G is , ln ( P ( O ( G ) |p ) ) =
( ci ( G ) ln ( p ) + ( li − ci ( G ) ) ln ( 1 − p ) )
( 4 )
Xi where li is the total number of citation links of a node i , and ci ( G ) is the number of citation links of a node i that fall within G . Let p∗ ( G ) be the value of p that maximizes Eq 4 . With the number of nodes in G fixed , p∗ ( G ) tends to increase , as the connectivity of G gets denser .
Let ’s consider GA and GA∩B under the hypothesis that the co occurrence of terms A and B does not represent a new topic . Under this null hypothesis , the generative process of determining which document in GA contains the term B is an independent random process with respect to the distribution of the citation links of GA . Thus , if we let p0A be our guess for p∗ ( GA∩B ) under the null hypothesis , our best guess for p0A is the probability that maximizes the average loglikelihood of the following subgraphs of GA . The subgraphs we consider are any subgraphs of GA that have the same number of nodes as that of GA∩B , and the citation links between them . Formally , p0A is given as follows . p0A = arg max p
1 nCk XGσ ln ( P ( O ( Gσ ) |p ) )
( 5 ) where n is the number of nodes in GA , k is the number of nodes in GA∩B , and the summation over Gσ runs over any graph Gσ that satisfies the following
V ( Gσ ) ⊂ V ( GA ) , |V ( Gσ ) | = |V ( GA∩B ) | , E ( Gσ ) = {e ( vi , vj ) |e ( vi , vj ) ∈ E ( GA ) , vi , vj ∈ V ( Gσ)}
( 6 ) p0A can be analytically obtained to be
( 7 ) p0A =
( k − 1)Pi∈V ( GA ) ci ( GA ) ( n − 1)Pi∈V ( GA ) li
Now , we think of the alternative hypothesis that says the co occurrence of terms A and B represents a new topic . Under this hypothesis , our guess for p∗ ( GA∩B ) , which we denote as p1A , should be significantly higher than p0A . We set it as p1A = m · p0A , where m is a mulplicative parameter greater than 1 .
The following score TA ( A , B ) is our confidence about how likely the co occurrence of terms A and B represents a new topic , with respect to a term A .
TA ( A , B ) = ln„ P ( O ( GA∩B ) |p1A ) P ( O ( GA∩B ) |p0A)«
( 8 )
Note that our guess for p1A need not be exactly p∗ ( GA∩B ) nor even close to it . The actual value of p∗ ( GA∩B ) only needs to be relatively closer to p1A than to p0A to make TA ( A , B ) positive . In particular , if the actual p∗ ( GA∩B ) is significantly larger than p0A , TA ( A , B ) will be positive for servation O(G ) for a single term topic detection in Section 2 . The choice is made so that the new observation O(G ) can account for graph connectivity in a continuous spectrum . a wide range of m . Thus , with large m , we could filter false positives , while we may only lose false negatives with weak confidence . We experimented on several values for m in the range of [ 2 , 10 ] . While the result does not sensitively change over a wide range of m , the choice of m = 6 seems to provide a good balance between false positives and false negatives . In Section 4 , we present the result with m = 6 .
We then get TB ( A , B ) in the similar way by looking at GA∩B and GB . Our final score for judging whether the cooccurrence of terms A and B represents a new topic or not is given by taking the minimum of TA ( A , B ) and TB ( A , B ) , reflecting our belief that the link density of GA∩B should show a significant departure from that of both GA and GB .
TopicScore ( A , B ) = min ( TA ( A , B ) , TB ( A , B ) )

4 . EVALUATION
We use arXiv and Citeseer for evaluation .
We restrict the terms we consider to all possible bigrams in the corpus . We choose bigram as our term unit , because bigrams typically convey more concrete ideas than unigrams , yet higher grams might suffer from the explosion of the number of terms and sparseness of data for each term . But , it is only a choice of convenience and our algorithm can be applied to any n grams . We further restrict the terms by pruning out low frequency terms that appear in less than 5 documents in the corpus and by pruning out 35 stop words . 4.1 Evaluation on arXiv Data arXiv is an actively maintained online repository of research papers in physics . We take papers from year 1991 to year 2006 that span 7 major arXiv areas . This is in total 214,546 papers and 2,165,170 citation links between them , which amounts to 10.09 per document citations . For each paper , we use its abstract as its document .
We perform the following experiments . First , for all possible terms appearing in the corpus , we compute the single term topic score measure of Eq 1 , and get a ranked list of topics . Second , for all possible term pairs in the corpus , we compute the topic score of two terms as in Eq 9 , and get a ranked list of topics .
The running time is reasonable . We used a pentium IV PC with 2GB memory . It took 45 minutes to generate the term citation graphs for all terms and their inverted index . It took 4 minutes to compute the single term topic scores for all terms . It took about 10 hours to compute the topic scores of two terms for all possible term pairs .
To consider all pairs of terms for two term topic scores could be prohibitive as there are a huge number of terms . But , we need to consider a pair of terms only when the two terms appear together in at least one paper . This cooccurrence matrix is pretty sparse when a document is an abstract . Thus we achieve a reasonable running time for the two term topic score experiment .
411 Detecting Topics Represented by a Single Term Computing the topic scores for each term in the corpus according to Eq 1 gives a ranked list of topics . The ranked list of terms has 137,098 entries ( terms ) , where top entries constitute topic terms and bottom entries constitute non topic terms . Table 1 shows the top 15 entries from the ranked list . The first 2 columns represent the rank and the topic term respectively . The third column labeled as < n , nc , |E| > is an information about the term citation graph of the topic term : n is the number of nodes in the citation graph of a topic term , nc is the number of nodes that has at least one link connecting to any other node within the graph , |E| is the number of edges in the graph .
An objective and quantitative evaluation of the result is difficult due to the lack of standard formal measures for topic detection tasks . However , when the results were examined by the domain experts , they recognized the topics presented in Table 1 . Also , we have an informal evidence that these top ranked terms do represent highly prevalent topics in the physics literature . When we typed in each topic term of the top 20 ranks as a search query to wwwgooglecom , 19 of them returned Wikipedia entries within the top 5 of the google search results . The inspection of the Wikipedia articles reveals that most of them have serious physics research oriented contents . The one topic term that did not return the Wikipedia entry was “ heavy quark ” . But , the second rank entry of its google search result is “ The 5th international workshop of heavy quark physics ” , indicating that it also is a prevalent research topic in physics .
The topic terms at the top ranks are topics in large scale , as we can see from the term citation graph information of < n , nc , |E| > column . The topic term entries down to a few thousand’th level of the ranked list still present meaningful topics . Table 2 shows a few entries of topic terms around 100’th , 500’th , 1000’th , 2000’th ranks . There is an apparent trend of topic scale getting smaller as we go down to lower ranked topic terms , as seen from < n , nc , |E| > column . Topics discovered at these levels could be more interesting as they tend to represent more specific ideas than the more generic and prevalent top ranked topic terms . Figure 4 shows the term citation graphs of the topic terms at 100’th , 990’th , 1971’th ranks , respectively ( Refer to Footnote 2 for how to read the graphs ) . We see the scale difference of the topic terms at different ranks . Figure 4 c ) suggests that even at 1971’th rank , there is still a meaningful topic that binds the papers in the term citation graph .
As explained in section 2 , the bottommost entries of the ranked list are stop words or common phrases , whose term citation graphs are much better explained by hypothesis H0 than by hypothesis H1 . Table 3 shows the bottommost 15 terms of the ranked list .
It should be noted that the topics discovered by our algorithm have a varying degree of prevalence and specificity , that are natural in the given corpus . This is because we do not assume a predefined number of topics to discover , as language model approaches or graph based clustering approaches do . Fixing the number of topics to discover has the effect of determining the scale of topics in advance .
To see the overall property of the entire ranked list , we present two plots , Figure 5 and Figure 6 . Figure 5 is a plot of term rank vs . the log size of the term citation graph averaged over 100 consecutive terms . It shows that the term frequency gets higher , as the rank gets close to either the highest or the lowest ranks . This is because in a large scale term citation graph one hypothesis is strongly preferred over the other due to many instances of per node observations that support the hypothesis .
To show the connectivity of term citation graphs , we devise the following measure and use it in the plot of Figure 6 . Given a term citation graph GA , ci ( GA ) denotes the number of links of a node i that falls within GA , li denotes the top rank 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 . . . topic ( term )

Table 1 : The topic terms of top 15 ranks from arXiv total number of links of a node i , nA denotes the size of GA , and N denotes the size of the full citation graph . We nA /N call Pi ci ( GA ) /Pi li as edge containment . It reflects how clustered GA is with respect to the rest of the full citation graph . We normalize the edge containment by the relative size of the term citation graph . We call the resulting quantity Pi ci(GA)/ Pi li as normalized edge containment . The normalized edge containment should default to 1 if the citation pattern of GA is random . Figure 6 shows a plot of term rank vs . the normalized edge containment . As expected , the topic terms at high ranks show high normalized edge containment , while the non topic terms at low ranks show low normalized edge containment . What is interesting to note is that the graph is not monotonically decreasing : up to the top few thousand ranks , the normalized edge containment keeps increasing . This agrees with our observation that the middle rank topics are more specific than the top rank topics .

412 Detecting Topics Represented by a Set of Terms By computing the term pair topic scores of Eq 9 for all possible pairs of terms in arXiv corpus , we get a ranked list where each entry is a pair of terms that might represent a topic . Since we are looking at the intersection citation graph of two terms , we get a sparser graph to look at . In order to alleviate the sparseness , we stemmed our corpus . Table 4 shows the top 12 entries of the ranked list . These entries are the topics that are represented not by a single term , but by the relation involving a set of terms . For example , the rank

1 entry has “ phase transit(ion ) ” and “ standard model ” as its topic terms . “ phase transition ” is a general term meaning a change in macroscopic state of a large scale system . “ standard model ” is a prevalent theory of particle physics that describes the fundamental interactions of elementary particles . It turns out that the papers at the intersection of the two terms talk about the “ phase transition ” occuring in “ standard model ” or the “ phase transition ” occuring in minimal supersymmetric “ standard model ” which is an extension of “ standard model ” . The individual term “ phase transition ” or “ standard model ” has a much broader research context than the topic identified . The rank 2 entry has “ gauge theory ” and “ matrix model ” as its topic terms . It turns out that there was a heavily cited paper that started the whole idea of analyzing “ gauge theory ” using the computational techniques from “ matrix model ” , and the majority of papers in the intersection graph talk about the further development of this idea . As explained in the previous section 3 , the papers of the rank 7 entry talk about using “ quantum dot ” as a hardware implementation of “ quantum computer ” .
The last three columns of table 4 show the citation graph information < n , nc , |E| > for term A , term B , and their intersection , respectively . They show that the connectivity of the intersection graph GA∩B exhibits significant departure from the same size random subgraph of GA or GB .
4.2 Evaluation on Citeseer Data
Our Citeseer data contains 716,771 papers , with 1,740,326 citations . This amounts to 2.43 citations per paper . For each paper , we use its title and abstract combined as its document . The number of bigrams in the corpus after pruning out the low frequency bigrams and 35 stop words is 631,839 . The majority of papers are from year 1994 to year 2004 . We divided the documents into two different document sets . One set contains all the documents up to year 1999 , and the other set contains all the documents since year 2000 .
We performed the single term topic score measure of Eq 1 to each set . The top 25 topic entries of each set are shown in parallel in Table 5 . We see that the top rank topics have changed significantly between the two time periods . We see that many top rank topics of the time frame since 2000 carry recent trends that were not significant before . Examples are “ sensor networks ” , “ ( ad ) hoc networks ” , “ wireless sensor ” , “ intrusion detection ” , “ semantic web ” , “ xml data ” , and “ image retrieval ” . “ support vector ( machine ) ” was ranked 35th in the document set up to 1999 , and it has risen to the rank 5 in the document set since 2000 . “ congestion control ” more or less maintains its topic rank through the different time periods . We observe the fall of many top ranked topics of the document set up to 1999 , in the time period since 2000 . The ranked list of topic terms is quite instructive as well : initially , we did not recognize the 7th rank “ interior point ” of the time frame up to 1999 as a topic . But , it turns out “ interior point ” represents an important family of algorithms in linear programming .
As in the case of arXiv evaluation , we see that the ranked list of topic terms from Citeseer has meaningful topics even around a thousand’th level with the apparent trend of topic scale getting smaller as we go down the ranks . Due to the space limitation , however , we do not present the result .
In order to see the time evolution of topics more clearly , we performed the following experiment . We ran the single term topic score measure for the entire Citeseer document collection . Then , for each term in top 70 , we generated a plot where x axis is years spanning from 1994 to 2004 and yaxis is the number of documents of the term citation graph in a particular year normalized by the total number of documents in that year . Figure 7 shows the plots for 12 such topic terms out of top 70 terms . We see a sharp recent rise of rank term A term B for term A

Table 5 : The top 25 topic terms of two different time periods from Citeseer between the term distribution and the citation link distribution for a topic . Second , we use for a topic measure the log odds ratio of binary hypotheses based on a probabilistic description of graph connectivity .
Previous work on topic detection can be largely divided into two groups . The majority of papers take a language model based approach . This approach tends to focus on text , but a few papers extend the model to incorporate links . Another group of work is based on studies of graph properties . Most of these papers address a problem related to topic detection : community detection . They tend to use the non probablistic aspects of graph properties . There are also related papers that share some of the ideas used in this paper . Specifically , these ideas are examination of patterns at individual term level , usage of log odds ratio to detect patterns , and investigation of the notion of term informativeness .
The language modeling approach [ 9 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 7 , 16 ] assumes a multi stage generative process where semantically meaningful modalities such as topics or authors are chosen as an intermediate step , and then the words are drawn from the multinomial distribution conditioned on these modalities . These papers differ in the design choice for the generative process . Examples of design decisions are the choice of modalities or the final features that will be produced . [ 9 ] uses the document generation process conditioned on topic distributions . [ 22 ] uses authors as distribution over topics as additional modalities . [ 23 ] detects topics over time by letting the generative process produce the timestamps of words as well as the words themselves . A number of papers extend the model to incorporate links . [ 7 ] treats the reference list of a paper as another final feature to produce , in addition to the bag of words . [ 16 , 24 ] apply the language model approach to social network analysis where documents are the communication links such as e mail messages between people . [ 4 ] aims to overcome the inability of latent dirichlet allocation used in the papers above for describing the correlation of topics , by including the correlation matrix of topics in the generative process . [ 17 ] computes the themes of a document collection by the mixture model using the EM algorithm .
Graph properties are used to study community structures by [ 10 , 8 , 11 , 20 , 19 , 13 , 2 ] . As a distance metric [ 10 ] uses the similarity of citation patterns , [ 8 , 11 ] use the notion that

Some papers in this group combine the information from text as well . [ 13 ] extracts storylines for a query by identifying densely connected bipartites from the document term graph of the search results . [ 2 ] improves the document categorization performance by starting from a text based categorization result and then iteratively relabeling the documents to further satisfy the constraints imposed by the link proximity relation .
Our approach of looking at citation patterns at an individual term level and using the loglikelihood to explain the observation is inspired by [ 12 ] . [ 12 ] detects a topic as a burst of activities represented by the state transition in a markov chain . In an experiment on paper titles and presidential speeches the paper shows that topics can be effectively detected as time bursts in a single term level . The idea of anomaly detection by log odds ratio is used in a number of papers related to topic detection . [ 18 ] uses the log odds ratio of event frequencies to detect space time clusters . [ 14 ] discovers a set of words as topic signature in a supervised learning setting by comparing the log odds ratio of word frequency in topic documents and non topic documents . The ranked list of terms for topics produced by our algorithm shows a continuous spectrum of term informative ness in representing topics . The notion of term informativeness is explored in a number of related contexts . [ 5 ] detects the terms informative about the citation links to use them as features for document categorization . For this purpose , they use the expected entropy loss measure , which resembles the one used in the decision tree feature selection . [ 21 ] detects the informative terms for named entity detection , using the idea that informative terms are better modeled by a mixture of two unigram models while non informative terms are better modeled by a single unigram model .
6 . DISCUSSIONS
It is worthwhile to note that graph connectivity observations used in our algorithms are pluggable . One can plug in an observation that best suits one ’s need . As different observations may represent different aspects of graph connectivity , the choice of an observation affects the topic score result . For example , the observation used in Section 2 for a single term topic score concerns whether a node has a connection to the rest of the graph or not , but it does not distinguish how many connections a node has . Thus , the observation is generous on loosely connected topics . As a result , the highest topic scores are given to the large scale prevalent topics even though these topics are not as tightly connected as the more specific smaller scale topics .
Another point to note is that because our algorithms dis

Specifically , with our topics , a single document can be involved in multiple topics , and topics could have hierarchical covering relations or nonhierarchical overlapping relations among themselves . Understanding the structure of the relationship between the topics is left as future work .
7 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper , we presented algorithms to detect topics from a linked textual corpus based on the unique approach of using the correlation between the term distribution and the link distribution for topics . Our algorithms produce a ranked list of terms for topics represented by a single term and for topics represented by a set of terms . Our evaluation on arXiv and Citeseer data show that the method is effective . Topics discovered by our algorithms reveal novel aspects of topic detection . The ranked list shows a continuous spectrum of topics of varying prevalence and specificity that are natural in the given corpus . The relations among the terms that represent topics are revealed by the two term topic score measure . As an interesting by product , our algorithm can discern common phrases without the prior knowledge of stop word notion . The possibility of discovering complex topic relations and the pluggable characteristic of graph connectivity observations are discussed .
