Abstract
For marketing to function in a globalized world it must respect a diverse set of local cultures . With marketing efforts extending to social media platforms , the crossing of cultural boundaries can happen in an instant . In this paper we examine how culture influences the popularity of marketing messages in social media platforms . Text mining , automated translation and sentiment analysis contribute largely to our research . From our analysis of 400 posts on the localized Google+ pages of German car brands in Germany and the US , we conclude that posting time and emotions are important predictors for reshare counts .
1 Introduction
To a large part , marketing can be summarized as giving the consumers what they want . In the right contexts , a proven method is to do this informally . While informal , heard it through the grapevine communication channels have always been important to marketing niche products and in conquering new markets , social media enables marketers to use word of mouth propagation for more established mainstream products as well [ 1 , 2 ] . Since word of mouth is a very powerful vehicle to transport marketing messages [ 3 ] , marketers seek to harness the power of social media to enlist users not only as consumers but as propagators and endorsers of products [ 4 ] . As [ 2 ] demonstrate , social media can be used very cost effectively , enabling marketers to reach millions of users with only a negligible amount of resources .
It is therefore tempting to use social media marketing efforts to spread across traditional borders and reach for new markets . However , there is a risk associated with this : communication needs to be aware when crossing borders venturing into the realms of other cultures .
A lot has been written about the need for culturally aware communication and the manage[5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] It is generally recommended [ 9 ] , to ment of global brands in a globalized economy . develop culturally similar markets when moving one ’s brand abroad . This is , because culturally accurate ( ie functioning ) translations of marketing and branding messages are very complex to produce . In this paper we seek to examine how the accessibility to word of mouth propagation changes across cultures . To answer this question we employed data and sentiment mining techniques to the social media posts of two brands ( BMW and Audi ) in two countries ( Germany and the US ) and compared the factors that contributed to these posts being endorsed by users .
This paper is organized as follows . We will first review the literature on social media , our target platform Google+ and how marketing is done there . We then turn our attention on cultural aspects of communication and marketing . We complete this paper ’s theoretical part with a concise review of sentiment mining methodology . We then present the method behind our data harvest/generation and introduce the statistical models we optimized . Finally , we discuss our findings and close with some concluding remarks that point to further research .

2 Social Media Marketing
In this section we focus on a rather novel arena of marketing : social media marketing . To this end we will give a short run down on social media and then introduce a recently becoming increasingly popular social media platform : Google+ [ 10 , 11 ] . Because of its comparably young age , Google+ has not yet received widespread attention in academia , apart from its technical aspects [ 12 ] . This is perhaps due to its somewhat differing implementation of classical social media .
Social media and online social networks refer to a rather new phenomenon in human , internetbased communication . Diverging from a dogma that had been valid for about two decades , users themselves started out using blogs to regularly provide content themselves . While blogs were and still are appealing to users interested in writing longer texts , social media as a mass phenomenon took off only after the introduction of communities centered around profiles , frequent status updates and shared content creation . Today , leading examples of social media platforms are Facebook , Twitter , vKontakte and Google+ , to name but a few . While the implementation details differ from a technical point of view , there is a common theoretical framework .
The center of social media are user following relationships . They can be thought of as ( directed ) graphs linking up users . From a network theoretical point of view , this graph has small world properties and has a node distribution that follows a power law [ 13 , 14 ] , thus being very similar to actual , offline human behavior . This relationship is called following and implies that messages sent by a user will be pushed into the stream of news all of her followers receive . While some social media platforms require reciprocal fellowship relations ( eg Facebook , LinkedIn ) , others don’t ( eg Google+ ) .
Once a message gets pushed to a user , that user can decide on how to further treat the message . Besides the obvious ignoring , a user has two levels of endorsement to choose from : liking and resharing . Endorsements are then pushed further downstream the user ’s network . The lesser form of endorsement , liking , does usually not contain the endorsed message but only the fact that a message from the original author was endorsed and a link to that message . User interfaces will also show likes not as prominently as the reshares . With reshares the entire original message gets pushed into the streams of the user ’s followers , just as if the user had posted the message herself .
Another corner stone of social media are profile pages . There individuals and companies can maintain a presence with information related to them [ 15 ] . Most platforms distinguish between profiles for humans and pages for businesses and brands . However , conceptionally , they are the same .
Google ’s implementation of a social media platform , termed Google+ and albeit being quite young , is increasing rapidly in popularity [ 10 , 11 , 15 ] . Here , following relationships are organized in circles , that act like address books or friend lists and allow for a more targeted resharing . While implementing a lesser form of endorsement ( +1ing ) , it is not quite clear how that endorsement functions . For one , it is used in Google ’s main business of information retrieval by allowing users to discover search results that have been endorsed by the people they follow . +1s also contribute to Google internal popularity metrics , ie recommending the circling of possible contacts based on similar +1ing behaviour . Finally , +1ed posts might show up in a user ’s stream , if Google deems them algorithmically interesting . However , the exact mechanics have not yet been published by Google .
Using social media for marketing purposes is an obvious choice : being able to interact with consumers in channels usually associated with friends and interesting people we follow , makes for a very attractive marketing context . This turns marketing presence into consumer activation [ 2 ] . A priceless achievement . Added to this is the possibility of marketing messages being reshared ,

40 91 62 46 thus profiting from traditional offline word of mouth benefits [ 16 , 17 , 18 ] .
Under these terms , marketers must aim to maximize the resharing of their messages . It is useful to think of the individual user as a filter through which a message must pass in order to reach further into the network of users [ 19 , 20 , 21 ] . A lot of research effort has been put into finding predictors for the expected reshare count of a message [ 22 , 23 ] . Message sentiment is identified by [ 24 , 25 ] as crucial predictors for resharing counts as is message length [ 25 ] . Temporal proximity and time of day are factors named in [ 26 ] ’s contribution .
3 Cultural Aspects of Marketing
Starting with Geert Hofstede ’s massive and groundbreaking survey of intercultural communication [ 27 ] , cultural aspects quickly became important when adapting marketing messages to local audiences of consumers [ 28 , 29 ] .
Applying Hofstede ’s insights on marketing , [ 1 , 2 , 9 ] come to the conclusion that marketing messages must be adapted to the cultural expectations of consumers for them to function . When looking at marketing in social media , this should also be true . Consumers organized into localized brand pages should differ in their preferences on marketing messages , just as they would differ in offline communication . From Hofstede ’s difference matrix , it is to be expected to find different marketing message preferences in the dimensions of Individuality and Uncertainty avoidance for our cases of Germany and the US . These differences should express themselves in terms of the importance of the filtering criteria per country , as introduced above .
In the next section we will review how sentiment mining can help in providing message characteristics for discriminating along the lines of cultural preferences .
3.1 Sentiment Mining
Sentiment Analysis and Opinion Mining are subfields of the area of Text Mining , see eg [ 31 ] . It is a classification task and represents the computational study of sentiments , subjectivity , appraisal , and emotions expressed in text . Companies usually spend huge amounts of money to find consumer opinions using consultants , surveys , and focus groups . A cleverly implemented sentiment mining tool supports such companies to save money .
An opinion is simply a positive or negative sentiment , view , attitude , emotion , or appraisal about an entity or an aspect of the entity [ 32 ] from an opinion holder [ 33 ] . The sentiment orientation ( sentiment polarity ) of an opinion can be positive , negative , or neutral ( no opinion ) . Besides in the ( sentiment ) polarity of a respective Google+ post , we are interested in the emotionality of a posting . However there is no agreed set of basic emotions of people among researchers . Parrott [ 34 ] identifies six main emotions , ie love , joy , surprise , anger , sadness , and fear , whereby the strengths of opinions and sentiments are sometimes related to certain

3.2 Data & Methods
The generation of the data set used in this analysis started out with the identification and designation of Google+ company pages . We settled for two German companies in the automotive industry , BMW and Audi , as German car brands in different countries make a good middle ground between niche and mainstream markets [ 36 ] .
Measuring culture of a company or any individual can be elusive . It is possible to use proxies like country of residence or nationality to locate an individual culturally [ 37 ] . We are following a similar path by looking at the companies respective local Google+ pages . We therefore chose the localized variants of the Google+ pages of Audia and BMW for Germany and the US.1
The following Tab . 2 shows the popularities of the respective companies’ local Google+ pages . Google offers two metrics to measure the popularity of a page . One is the circle count , ie the number of people that have subscribed to push updates of that page . The other one is the +1 count that aggregates the circle count with people +1ing the page or interacting with it in other ways 2 .
In order to build up a data base of marketing messages , the last 100 posts of each of these pages were retrieved . Due to different posting frequencies , the extension of the data ’s retrospection varies . Table 3 summarizes these differences . From these figures it is obvious , that English language content for the US versions of the G+ pages is provided far more frequently than for their German counterparts .
In the following we will describe the data set in greater detail . Table 5 gives an overview of directly measured message properties . The variable Age describes how many days in the past the message had been posted . This would obviously influence the number of reshares a message received or could receive . Message length is a property that in the past has often been used
1Even though Audi and BMW are both German brands , their main Google+ pages are international fronts .
So both localized version are comparable in catering to local audiences .

4 successfully to predict message reshare counts [ 23 ] .
As mentioned above , another aspect that – potentially – influences the frequency with which a message is being reshared is the time of day of the original post and the day in the week . For this analysis we recorded the date and time of the original post ( and converted the UTC timezone reported by Google to EST for the US and CET for Germany ) and distilled the day of week from it as well as the discrete factorization of the time of day part that is given in Tab . 4 .

3 53 240 63 40 1
While we did record the number of comments and +1s every message received , these forms of interaction and propagation are not considered any further in this analysis for their ambiguous meaning for marketing as detailed above .

70.59 13.38 18.86 150.77 388.23
Aside from these directly measured attributes of a message , we also computed every message ’s sentiment . German languange messages ( from the local German G+ pages ) were automatically translated using the Google Translate API3 . All computations ( and indeed the harvesting for that matter ) were done using R version 302 [ 38 ] . Computation and visualization was aided by the R packages ggplot2 [ 39 ] and MASS [ 40 ] . As detailed above , sentiment analysis extends into two distinct areas : polarity and emotions . The used software package offers to compute the positive—negative ratio , the ratio of the absolute log likelihoods of the message expressing a positive or negative sentiment , to measure polarity of a message . A value of 1 indicates a neutral statement , while values smaller than 1 point towards a negative statement .
Measuring the involved emotions is a little bit more complicated . Here , six dimensions of frequently occurring emotions have been identified and for every message the log likelihood of it reflecting these emotions is computed . Table 6 gives an overview of the distribution of the sentiment variables across the entire data set .
There is a considerable difference in the frequency and volume of messages being reshared between both countries , as is demonstrated by Fig 1 . In order to explain – at least partially – these differences , we use negative binomial models with a logistic link function .

The negative binomial model is an extension to the more familiar Poisson regression model . The latter frequently suffers from overdispersion , that is its sample variance exceeds its sample mean . It is possible to justify the appropriateness of a negative binomial model over a Poisson regression model , using a χ2 test [ 40 ] .
In order to model the reshare rate of a message ( as opposed to raw counts of reshares ) , one has to take into account the potential exposure of a message . This is directly affected by the number of followers a G+ page has and the age of the message : the more followers to a page and the longer the message has been online , the more people are likely to have come across it . These measurement windows or base references are included as log offset terms in the models [ 40 ] .
For developing the model , we combine model enhancement with backward selection based on AIC . We start out with a simple model using the classical covariates as described above and optimizing it using backward selection ( M1 ) . In a next step , we introduce Country ( US being the reference category ) as an interaction variable and employ backward selection again ( M2 ) . Finally , we include the variables from our sentiment analysis ( M3 ) . All models were tested for the appropriateness of a negative binomial specification using aforementioned χ2 test .
In all models , the logarithm of message age is used as an offset to model exposure . For models that do not contain the variable country , the logarithm of the number of followers of a G+ page is included as an additional offset .
4 Results
In this section we present the results of our analysis . Tables 8 through 10 list the estimated parameters , their standard errors , and p values for all three models . Note however , that the pvalues are given for reference purposes only . We are aware that we are not working with a random sample here and p values are therefore ultimately meaningless . This is not problematic , as we are following a data mining approach ( as opposed to a classical inferential statistics approach ) and are interested in real observations and real differences and not estimates that generalize towards a larger population .
In a first step we sought to assess the classical covariates established in the literature . Stepwise

When allowing the stepwise selection algorithm to choose from interaction terms with the country of the G+ page , the daytime related term in the model becomes dependent on the country . The change in sign is a clear indication for the plausibility of the additional interaction . Model fit increased as well with AICM 2 = 3004 compared to AICM 1 = 3113 .

The addition of the message sentiment variables improves the fit only marginally : AICM 3 = 2994 . However , two sentiment variables’ effects on the reshare rate differ across countries : Anger and Surprise .

5 Discussion
These models allow for a number of insights . Foremost , we find in line with most literature on message propagation in social networks , that time of day has a highly significant effect on the number of rebroadcasts a message will receive . It is noteworthy , however , that the size of the
8 effect changes with the country of the observation . Apparently , German G+ pages don’t benefit from nighttime posts as much as Americans do . Table 11 presents the marginal effects of postint time across country .
Table 11 : Marginal effect of a daytime post on expected reshare count across countries .
Country Germany US
Daytime Nighttime 10.73 79.24
7.42 27.15
Day of week also has a very significant influence here . Messages sent out on Tuesdays or Saturdays will receive increased attention . This effect is consistent across all models and does not depend on country .
Finally , there is another effect here that is dependent on culture : the role of emotion , more precisely of Anger and Surprise . There is a rather strong effect testifying to German distaste of surprises . The expected count of reshares for a message increases with its notion of surprise in the US , while in Germany surprises slightly decrease these chances . A similar observation holds for Anger . Figure 2 exhibits the sizes of these effects .
In light of the differences in culture observed by Hofstede , we found evidence for message traits that are consistent across diverse cultures differing in the individuality and uncertainty domains . This is chiefly the preference of certain weekdays and the perhaps obvious rejection of disgusting emotions embedded in advertising messages .
Other message and communication properties , time of day when the message was sent and angry or surprising sentiments , differ between the two cultures . Consumers in the US seem to be prefer messages that are being sent out at nighttime , while their German counterparts are rather indifferent in that regard . This might be a sign for America ’s highly valued individualism and work ethics that would postpone past time activities like checking Google+ pages to the nighttime .
German distaste of surprises and angry messages can as well be explained in terms of Hofstede ’s cultural dimensions : Uncertainty is something that is immanent to surprises and also anger poses certain risks . Germany ’s high level of uncertainty avoidance might explain the increased resharing of messages exhibiting neither anger nor surprise .
6 Conclusion
In light of these findings , it becomes clear that marketers must consider the culture of their audience even in an online arena . Alas , as Kitchen puts it :
“ Social media can be a proxy for consumer ethnography , the anthropological approach of understanding a culture by becoming part of it , because they provide virtual access to an often unguarded engagement with quite intimate aspects of consumer experience . ” [ 2 , p . 36 ]
And who would not be cautious when treading with marketing intentions in intimate places ? This cross cultural communication might be hindered by a number of factors : ethnocentrism ( ie ignoring other cultures ) , parochialism ( focusing too much on local peculiarities ) and stereotyping ( because reality can be to complex to model ) [ 41 ] .
While it has become clear in the last few decades that ethnocentrism is a deadly sin for marketers and parochialism equally hinders effective campaigns , stereotyping is still all too familiar

After all , segmented target groups defined by broad averages that marketers seek to please . And indeed , to avoid stereotyping , one needs not only to know the culture of a market , but to respect and adapt to individual consumers , wherever possible [ 9 ] .
We believe that this adaption is easier to be had than previously thought : with the massive amounts of data available from social media platforms , marketers can seek to understand customers more directly , away from cultural preconsiderations , and just watch them forwarding and endorsing messages . It is this observation that empowers us to learn from consumers what they want .
