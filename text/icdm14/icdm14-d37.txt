Abstract—In this paper , we study a challenging problem of inferring individuals’ role and statuses in a professional social network , which is of central importance in workforce optimization and human capital management . Realizing the natural setting of social nodes associated with dual view information , ie , the local node characteristics and the global network influence , we present a novel model that explores graph regularization techniques and integrates such information to achieve improved prediction performance . In particular , our prediction model is built upon the graph transductive learning framework that encodes an uncertainty regularization term in the conventional empirical risk minimization principle . Through taking advantage of the information from both the local profile and the global network characteristics , the final inference of the role or statues achieves minimum an empirical loss on the labeled set , as well as a minimum uncertainty on the unlabeled social nodes . We perform extensive empirical study using real wold data and compare with representative peer approaches . The experimental results on three real social network data sets show that the proposed model greatly outperforms a number of baseline models and is able to effectively infer in a wide range of scenarios .

I . INTRODUCTION
Being hinged with different social roles and statuses , people tend to behave fairly differently in social networks . For example , users in some social blogospheres can behave as content contributors , information sharers , or information receivers , while in some professional social media like Linkedin , users experience the professional network in various roles , such as engineer , sales person , recruiter etc [ 1 ] . Finally , in a collaborated workforce network ( e.g , a enterprise social network ) , the users can be largely categoried based on their job functions and job titles . Note that studying and understanding social roles in a network can gain actionable insights for organizations and companies since such learned knowledge can be used to perform optimal resource allocation and human resource management . In addition , understanding social roles also help improve the user experiences since the identified social roles can help to build effective social network applications in recommendation systems , question answering systems , and advertising systems [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] .
The problem of identifying social role in social networks has attracted increasing amount of attention and many techniques are presented in recent years [ 1 ] , [ 4 ] . Some previous works studied this social role prediction problem in a specific network or with some strong assumptions of the data . For example , researchers have developed methods for identifying social roles in Wikipedia [ 5 ] and email networks [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . Recently some work has been proposed on social network inference problems in different contexts . Henderson et al . [ 4 ] proposed a role discovery framework on networks . It is unsupervised and essentially a clustering approach ( using matrix factorization ) . A semi supervised semantic role labeling method is proposed in [ 8 ] . In a very recent study of identifying social roles in online social networks [ 1 ] , the authors explored five social principles and concepts that represent a variety of network characteristics and quantify their relations with social roles and statuses . However , it remains as an open challenge to maximize the usage of all available information such as social profiles as local node characteristics and the network influence as global information . Especially in the scenario of online social networks , data are collected from diverse domains or obtained from various feature extractors and exhibit heterogeneous properties . Hence , it motivates us to design a principled way to leverage such types of information to carry out the prediction of social role and status .
Motivated by multi view learning idea [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , here we propose a graph regularization based learning framework that integrates heterogeneous information . The goal is to jointly optimizes all the functions to exploit views of node characteristics as well as graph influence , and improve the prediction performance . In particular , through encoding the prediction uncertainty into the conventional empirical risk minimization principle , we propose an optimal prediction with minimum empirical loss , as well as minimum uncertainty given the observed node characteristics and network information . Different from existing coregularization method [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] , or co training framework [ 13 ] , which solely enforces prediction agreement across different views , the uncertainty regularization encourages to archive predictions with high confidence while exploiting the complementariness from dual view data ; thus is more feasible and robust for realistic scenario , where either view information might be problematic due to some reason . The extensive empirical studies using three real social network data sets clearly show that the proposed model consistently

767 outperforms a number of competing models with significant performance margins for a wide range of social role prediction scenarios . Our proposed dual uncertainty minimization framework can be easily generalized to analyze other applications with the consideration of heterogenous factors from multiple view information .
II . RELATED WORK
A . Social Roles Mining
In real social network , due to the missing , outdated and non standard data issues , the task of social roles mining is quite challenging . In summary , most of the existing methods can be categorized in the following three groups : 1 ) rules based methods to identify roles from textual information ; 2 ) unsupervised learning methods such as clustering social nodes with matrix factorization techniques ; and 3 ) semisupervised learning methods using node properties or link information . For example , editors in Wikipedia have been studied in [ 5 ] . Email users of Palins email network have been analyzed in [ 7 ] . In [ 14 ] , the authors study user attribute inference in university social networks by applying community detection . Recently some work has been proposed on social network inference problems in different contexts . Henderson et al . [ 4 ] proposed a role discovery framework on networks . Zhao et al . [ 1 ] explored five social principles and concepts that represent a variety of network characteristics and quantify their relations with social roles and statuses . We extract the same categories of the features used in [ 1 ] as the node features in our experiments .
B . Graph Regularization
Single Graph Regularization : In graph based transductive learning setting , we have iid ( independent and identically distributed ) labeled samples XL = {xi , yi}l i=1 and unlabeled samples XU = {xi}l+u i=l+1 ( l + u = N ) . The objective is to infer the missing labels YU = {ˆyi}l+u i=l+1 corresponding to the unlabeled data XU . We can construct a similarity graph G from X = {XL , XU } , where the vertices represent data samples and the weighted edges i,j=1 denote similarities between samples . Let W = {wi,j}n f ( xi ) be the classifier , a classical regularization framework solves the following minimization problem : f ∗ = arg min
T ( f ; G ) f
= arg min f l
X i=1
V(f ( xi ) , yi ) ) + λLG(f )
( 1 ) where V is some loss function , λ is parameter to balance the empirical fitness and function smoothness , LG(f ) is the single view graph regularizer . Denoting the degree matrix D = diag(d1 , d2 , , dn ) , di = Pj wij and the unnormalized graph Laplacian [ 15 ] by L = D − W , a single view graph regularizer LG(f ) over the function f can be written as :
LG(f ) = X wij ||f ( xi ) − f ( xj )||2 i,j
= trace(f T(D − W)f ) = trace(f TLf )
( 2 ) where f = [ f ( x1 ) , f ( x2 ) , , f ( xn ) ] is a column vector . Based on the aforementioned graph Laplacian based regularization framework , various semi supervised learning algorithms are proposed , including the local and global consistency formulation [ 16 ] , Gaussian fields and Harmonic function formulation [ 17 ] , transductive support vector machines [ 18 ] , and the manifold regularization formulation [ 19 ] .
Graph Co Regularization :
In the two view semisupervised learning setting , each sample x = ( xa , xb ) is seen in two views with xa ∈ Xa and xb ∈ Xb . The setup and the algorithms can also be generalized to more than two views . For simplicity , we assume the case with two graphs Ga = {Wa , Da , La} and Gb = {Wb , Db , Lb} . The goal is to learn the prediction function pair f = ( f a , f b ) associated with Ga and Gb , in a joint form . Considering function smoothness over single graphs and the agreement between two views , the graph co regularization is formed as : LGa,G b(f a , f b ) = λa||f ||2 G b + γS(f a , f b ) = λa||f ||2 G b + γ||f a − f b||2 = trace(λa(f a)TLaf a + λb(f b)TLbf b + γ(f a − f b)T(f a − f b ) ) ( 3 )
Ga + λb||f ||2 Ga + λb||f ||2
Ga and ||f ||2
G b are regularization terms over inwhere ||f ||2 dividual views , and S(f a , f b ) is the term interpreted as a requirement of smoothness over the graph for the pair f = ( f a , f b ) . The core part of graph co regularization is to utilize the agreement among learners trained on different representations of the same problem to improve the overall performance . However , the “ consensus ” assumption of multiple view could be questionable since each data graph might contribute different and complementary prediction power . And for the extreme case , the view agreement will significantly weaken the prediction performance when either of the view data is not reliable .
Combined Graph Laplacians : Except for Graph CoRegularization , another way to construct a multi view regularizer is Combined Graph Laplacians [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , which applies to convex combinations of graph kernels parameterized by a compact set . Given two view representations Ga and Gb , the convex combination of the graph Laplacians is defined as K(λ ) = λLa + ( 1 − λ)Lb ( λ > 0 ) . Then the learning problem is formulated as :
( f ∗ , K(λ)∗ ) = arg min f,λ l
X i=1
V(f ( xi ) , yi ) ) + γ||f ||K(λ ) ( 4 )
768 which is a joint minimization problem over f and K(λ ) , and can be solved via an alternative optimizer iteratively proposed in [ 22 ] .
III . THE PROPOSED METHODS
A . Preliminaries the rest of
We first introduce some notations and definitions that we will use throughout the paper . Assume we have a partially labeled social network G = ( VL , VU , E , Xa , Xb ) , where VL is the set of labeled users with social roles/statuses and VU is the set of unlabeled users in the social network . We note that the set of all users in the network V = {vi}N i=1 = VL ∪VU and VL ∩VU = ∅ . E represents the set of all edges in the network . Xa and Xb are are two view data representations of V , where Xa is node view from users and Xb is the link view , separately . Let yvi be the label for user vi , xa i be a vector of node i be the link view representation . Suppose attributes and xb we have the set of labels to be C = {1 , , c} , which contains C different roles . The task is to infer labels of users with unknown social roles : yvi ∈ C where vi ∈ VU .
We formulate this problem as the graph based transductive learning problem . That is , given the labeled nodes VL and unlabeled nodes VU with dual view representation Xa and Xb , we aim to learn the pair function f = ( f a , f b ) with a graph regularization framework , then the label of VU can be predicted by combining f a and f b .
Dual View Representation : For each user vi , the representation from the node view xa is pretty straightforward : i either a BOW ( bag of words ) of profile information , or a combination of social factors [ 1 ] , such as Local Clustering Coefficient , Degree Centrality , Average Neighbor Degree , Embeddedness and Number of Communities . There are various of methods for the representation of xb i , such as direct link , demonstrating friend/follower/following information in is represented as N dimension vector , social network . xb i with the j th element xb i,j denoting link connectivity of user vj . Then we use a very natural way called neighbor node overlapping to measure link connectivity by Jaccard similarity [ 23 ] .
B . Dual View Uncertainty Regularizer
In the co regularization framework , the term S(f a , f b ) measures of smoothness to enforce the right complexity for the dual view prediction . In this work , instead of the smoothness term in co regularization , we propose a new term called uncertainty regularizer , which measures the uncertainty and complementariness of the prediction from different views . The objective is to enforce minimum uncertainty for the prediction from dual views instead of purely enforcing agreement between different views .
Given the two view data Xa = {xa i }u+l i=1 and Xb = i=1 , the predictions over the two views are f a(xa i ) i ) . For the predictions over a data point xi , let
{xb and f b(xb i }u+l i ) = k ) be the probability of the prediction pik = P ( f a(xa of xi of view A , and qik = P ( f b(xb i ) = k ) be the probability of the prediction of xi of view B , where k ∈ C = {1 , , c} is the class label . The uncertainty of the prediction measured by entropy is computed as :
H(pi ) = −
C
X k=1 piklogpik ,
H(qi ) = −
C
X k=1 qiklogqik
( 5 ) where pi = PC uncertainty over all the data points is expressed by : k=1 pik and qi = PC k=1 qik . And the
U(Xa , Xb ) =
N
X i=1
H(pi ) + H(qi )
( 6 )
Note that the entropy from each single view presents different confidence for individual data points . And Eq 6 measures the prediction uncertainty over the two views .
To embed the uncertainty measure into the graph regularization , let us rewrite the uncertainty formulation with f a and f b as :
U(f a , f b ) = −
N
X i=1
H(f a(xa i ) ) + H(f b(xb i ) )
=
=
N
X i=1 N f a(xa i )Tlog(f a(xa i ) ) + f b(xb i )Tlog(f b(xb i ) )
C
X
X i=1 k=1 f a iklog(f a ik ) + f b iklog(f b ik )
( 7 ) ik = f b(xb ik = f a(xa i )|i=k and f b i and xb i )|i=k represent where f a the prediction values of xa i , separately . Apparently , the uncertainty regularizer is monotonically related to the uncertainty value in Eq 5 . In general , we tend to derive the prediction with less uncertainty from at least one of the views and want to minimize Eq 7 .
Final Objective Combining the objective function T ( f a ; Ga ) and T ( f b ; Gb ) from each individual view ( as defined in co regularization ) , and the dual view uncertainty regularization proposed , we can suggests the following objective function :
( f ( a)∗ , f ( b)∗ ) = arg min
T ( f a ; Ga ) + T ( f b ; Gb ) + γU(f a , f b ) f a,f b
=
+ l
X i=1 l
X i=1
V(f a(xa i ) , yi ) ) + λaLGa ( f a )
V(f b(xb i ) , yi ) ) + λbLGb(f b )
+ γU(f a , f b )
( 8 ) where the empirical loss function over labeled data is
769 formulated as a squared loss form :
IV . EVALUATION
V(f a(xa i ) , yi ) ) = l
X i=1
||f a(xa i ) − yi||
= trace((f a − y)T(f a − y ) )
( 9 ) where y is the label indicator over the l samples . And the graph regularizer LG(f a ) is defined as : LG(f a ) = trace(f aT(Da − Wa)f a ) = trace(f aTLaf a ) ( 10 )
Then the pair prediction function ( f ( a)∗ , f ( b)∗ ) can be obtained by minimizing the objective function .
C . Optimization and Solution
We can derive the optimal solution for Eq 8 . Let ’s denote the objective function as O and take the partial derivatives over f a and f b :
∂O ∂f a = f a − y + λaLaf a + γ
∂U(f a , f b )
∂f a
= Fa + γ
∂U(f a , f b )
∂f a
∂O ∂f b = f b − y + λbLbf b + µ
∂U(f a , f b )
∂f b
= Fb + µ
∂U(f a , f b )
∂f b
( 11 )
( 12 ) where for both equations , the first parts are expressed with matrix format as : Fa = f a − y + λaLaf a and Fb = f b − y + λbLbf b , separately . However , the second part , need to be computed at the elements level :
∂U(f a , f b )
= 1 + logf a ik ,
∂U(f a , f b )
= 1 + logf b ik
∂f a ik Hence , given the computed partial derivatives , the update of f a and f b can be iteratively computed using the gradient descent as
∂f b ik
∂O ∂f a ) , f a|t+1 = f a|t − α(
∂O ∂f b ) ( 13 ) where α and β are the learning step lengths . In particular , at single element level , f a ik can be updated iteratively using the gradient descent f b|t+1 = f b|t − β( ik and f b
( 14 ) ik|t − αF a ik|t − βF b ik|t+1 = f a f a ik|t+1 = f b f b ik|t is the updated values of f a ik|t − αγ(1 + logf a ik ) ik|t − βγ(1 + logf b ik ) where f a ik at time stamp t , and ik and F b ik are the i th row and k th column element of F a Fa and Fb . The iterative updates can be terminated if there change for consecutive calculations are small enough for the two vectors ||f a|t+1−f a|t|| ≤ ǫ and ||f b|t+1−f b|t|| ≤ ǫ with a threshold constant ǫ . Finally , after both f a and f b achieve the convergence , the final prediction can be simply obtained by ˆY = 1 2 ( f a + f b ) , ( ˆY is the labels of all samples ) , similar to that used in co regularization .

A . Datasets
The first dataset we used is the email data of IBM employees , which was collected by IBM ’s internal system to analyze IBM workforce situation . We take a subset of the data starting from Nov 2011 . After pre processed , this email dataset is used to build a communication network with 3,547 nodes representing the authors of the emails , and 15,780 distinct weighted edges indicating the email communication between the nodes . Each node represents an employee associated with profile information and email content . The social roles of those social nodes in the email communication network consist of department head , manager , secretary , researcher , and programmer . The second dataset is from the professional social network Linkedin . We specifically identify a subsect of 25 , 265 users in the finance industry . In total , there are about 2.5 millions connections and the average node degree is 1008 Five social roles are identified as : Finance , Sales , IT , Support and Operation , which are corresponding to their job functions and titles . The third dataset used in our experiments is the IMDB dataset . We take a subset with the movies taken from the year 2001 to 2005 . The three major social roles are identified as actor/actress , director , and producer . These social roles are treated as network nodes that are connected if they collaborate in a same movie . Finally , we construct a network with a total of 20 , 402 nodes connected by 4 , 903 , 605 links .
B . Experimental Settings
Baselines : In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model , we compare the proposed DUMR method against a number of baselines . Since our method utilizes both node features and link information , intuitive baseline are those methods using a single view information , ie , Homophily A with only the link view and Homophily B with only node view . For both single view based methods , we apply the popular graph regularization framework proposed in [ 18 ] . In addition , we compared with Social Roles and Statuses Inference Model ( SRS ) , the method proposed in [ 1 ] . SRS first forms a factorized probabilistic model to learn a joint distribution over node and edge functions . Then the final prediction is achieved though an iterative algorithm that maximizes the marginal probabilities . Finally , we also compare with the co regularization ( Co Reg ) learning method in [ 11 ] and a combined regularization framework ( Com Reg ) , as described in [ 21 ] . For fair comparison , we use the same network with the uniform settings like the link weighting scheme [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] .

Table I , II , and III give the average prediction accuracies after 30 runs for all the compared methods on the three tested datasets respectively . In all the testing experiments , two fold cross validation is used . From these reported results , we can easily see that the proposed DUMR approach consistently outperforms the compared methods with clear performance gains . In addition , the SRS approach achieves the second best performance with significantly higher accuracies than the other four baselines . Note that both the SRS method and the DUMR method are specifically designed models for social role prediction , which utilize sophisticated techniques to integrate multiview information from social networks to perform accurate prediction . However , the proposed DUMR method forms a semi supervised prediction model to maximize the usage of all available data to achieve more robust predictions . Since the Co Reg and the Com Reg approaches are general multiview learning methods , they employ simple fusion strategies to combine different data sources that achieve limited performance gain . However , it is worth mentioning that the four methods using both link and node information always generate better prediction than the two Homophily methods , which confirms that both the local characteristics of nodes and the influence of the network present complementary information for better prediction .
