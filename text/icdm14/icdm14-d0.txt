Abstract—In social media analysis , one critical task is detecting burst of topics or buzz , which is reflected by extremely frequent mentions of certain key words in a short time interval . Detecting buzz not only provides useful insights into the information propagation mechanism , but also plays an essential role in preventing malicious rumors . However , buzz modeling is a challenging task because a buzz time series usually exhibits sudden spikes and heavy tails , which fails most existing time series models . To deal with buzz time series sequences , we propose a novel time series modeling approach which captures the rise and fade temporal patterns via Product Life Cycle ( PLC ) models , a classical concept in economics . More specifically , we propose a mixture of PLC models to capture the multiple peaks in buzz time series and furthermore develop a probabilistic graphical model ( K MPLC ) to automatically discover inherent life cycle patterns within a collection of buzzes . Our experiment results show that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing state of theart approaches on buzzes clustering . keywords : Time Series Modeling , Time Series Clustering
I . INTRODUCTION
Social media is growing at an explosive rate , and hundreds of millions of users generate vast amounts of contents on various social media web sites , such as Twitter and Tumblr . One critical problem in social media analysis is to effectively model buzz events , which are reflected by frequent mentions of certain key words in a short time interval , such as new iPhone or Hurricane Sandy . Since the buzz events are closely related to human activities , effectively modeling buzzes could help us track mass attention , obtain public opinions , or forecast users’ reactions to a particular event in the near future .
Buzz modeling is an extremely challenging problem since many buzz events are unforeseeable ( eg , earthquakes or hurricanes ) , while others may involve human interventions . As a result , a buzz time series , which consists of the number of mentions for each time unit , usually exhibits sudden spikes and heavy tails . Thus , it is very hard to represent a buzz time series using traditional time series models [ 3 ] . Existing buzz modeling methods use simple time series models ( eg , univariate models ) , and explore additional feature cues ( such as sentiment , spreading measures and controversialist ) , to predict whether a certain topic can become viral [ 7 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 5 ] . These methods achieve success to a certain extent , but few of them explicitly capture the inherent temporal patterns of buzzes . Effective buzz models , which not only can capture those sudden spikes and heavy tails patterns but also can differentiate true spikes from jagged noise in a time series sequence , are in great need .
One important challenge in pursuit of effective buzz models is how to find distinct temporal patterns within a set of buzz time series . For example , as seen in Figure 1 , Euro 2012 attracted more and more frequent mentions when it came close to its final match day , a sudden increase of frequency happened when the final match started , and the large volume was maintained for a couple of hours during the final match , after which the mention volume dropped dramatically in just a few hours on social media . Therefore capturing the temporal patterns and modeling the inherent structures of these temporal patterns can provide us useful insights into information propagation[22 ] and buzz prediction in social media .
In this paper , we propose to model rise and fade temporal shapes using product life cycle ( PLC ) models [ 16 ] . PLC was originally introduced by economists to model the life span of a product : introduction to the market ( initial sales ) , growth ( sudden increase of sales ) , equilibrium ( maturity phase defined by approximately constant sales ) and decline ( when the sales decrease dramatically ) . In Figure 1 , we can observe 4 different stages , which are segmented with dotted lines . In general , for different types of buzz events , the growth and equilibrium stages might be relatively short , while the decline stage varies . Moreover , a buzz sequence often has multiple peaks , and the number of peaks is unknown in advance . To handle a time series sequence with multiple peaks , we first propose to model each buzz with a mixture of PLC models , which is parameterized by weights , shapes , decay times , and locations of each individual PLC model . Then , we propose an efficient L1 regularized approach to achieve a sparse solution for the PLC mixture models . Second , to discover the underlying patterns in a collection of buzz timeseries , we develop a probabilistic graphical model , K Mixture of Product Life Cycle ( K MPLC ) , to automatically group buzz time series based on the PLC mixture parameters .
Through experiments , we compare the proposed approach with state of the art time series modeling and clustering methods including SpikeM [ 19 ] , K spectral centroid algorithm ( K SC ) [ 25 ] , and the spectral clustering with the dynamic time warping ( DTW+Spectral ) [ 26 ] . As compared to K SC , DTW+Spectral , and SpikeM , the proposed approach can systematically capture the sharp and heavy tailed peaks via the decay parameter . The experimental results show that K MPLC similar peak shapes but differ in the intervals between the peaks , K SC cannot identify these two time series as the same cluster through simple shifting or scaling .
III . MODELING BUZZES WITH MIXTURES OF PRODUCT
LIFE CYCLE MODELS
A . Product Life Cycle Models
The concept of Product Life Cycle ( PLC ) was originally proposed in economics in the 1960s [ 16 ] . The classical view of PLC assumes 4 phases to cover the life span of a product : introduction , growth , equilibrium and decline . Introduction stage refers to low growth rate of sales as the product is newly launched in the market ; growth stage implies that the public gains awareness of the product and consumers come to understand its benefits and accept it , so that a company can expect a period of rapid sales growth ; equilibrium stage corresponds to the product reaching maturity , so that the sales growth slows and sales volume eventually peaks and stabilizes ; decline stage indicates that the product enters into decline , as sales and profits start to fall because the market has become saturated , the product has become obsolete , or customer tastes have changed . Many different versions of PLC models are introduced in [ 3 ] .
To model the long decay trend of the decline stage of a product , Isaic Maniu and Voda [ 9 ] propose to use the Gamma distribution as a PLC model . The probability density function of Gamma distribution is : f ( t ; α , β ) =
βα Γ(α ) tα−1e−βt ,
( 1 ) where t ≥ 0 , α > 0 is the shape parameter , β > 0 is the rate parameter , and the Gamma function Γ(α ) is defined as :
Γ(α ) =Z ∞
0 tα−1e−tdt .
As compared to other distribution functions , such as the Gaussian distribution , the Gamma distribution can model a sudden rise and long decay trend in the decline stage of a PLC . Note that our method is not limited to the Gamma distribution , and it can be generalized to other base PLC models as well , such as the the Alpha distribution [ 9 ] .
B . Mixtures of PLC Model
Given a buzz topic , we count its mentions on a given social media channel during a pre determined time interval ( eg , an hour ) , and generate a time series sequence of this topic over a number of intervals during an observation window . Since a buzz sequence may consist of several obvious peaks , it could be modeled with multiple PLC models . As the number of peaks is not known in advance , we model a buzz sequence with a mixture of PLCs as :
LX`=1 f ( t ; w , α , β , µ ) = w`f ( t ; α` , β` , µ` ) ,
( 2 ) f ( t ; α , β , µ ) =fl Z −1(t − µ)α−1e−β(t−µ )

II . RELATED WORK
Time series modeling : To model the temporal patterns of online content , Matsubara et al . [ 19 ] propose an algorithm to model the rise and fall patterns of influence propagation . Hong et al . [ 8 ] attempt to model the time decay of topics on Twitter with Gamma function . Furthermore , the temporal information of online forums [ 6 ] , blogspace [ 13 ] , and online groups [ 12 ] has been explored and mined under different scenarios , and spatiotemporal patterns of subtopics have been investigated by [ 20 ] . However , most of the existing methods can only deal with single spike signal . Thus , existing time series modeling methods are not suited for buzz events with multiple spikes .
Time series clustering : Time series clustering has been an active research topic in recent years , and various time series clustering algorithms are proposed such as batch mode clustering [ 21 ] , [ 17 ] , incremental clustering [ 18 ] , and anytime clustering [ 26 ] . One of the important component of time series clustering is to choose a distance metric , and Dynamic Time Warping ( DTW ) and Complexity Invariant Distance ( CID ) are the most widely used metrics [ 26 ] , [ 1 ] . Clustering algorithms have been applied to various types of time series data , including snippets within long time series [ 21 ] , different time series streams [ 17 ] , and multiple time series matrix [ 10 ] . However , for extremely noisy buzz time series sequences , DTW scores tend to be inaccurate , and thus clustering performance can be degraded .
The most similar work to ours is that of Yang and Leskovec [ 25 ] , in which the K spectral centroid ( K SC ) algorithm is proposed to group similar time series via aligning peaks , shifting over time axis , and scaling over frequency axis . The K SC algorithm can cluster time series that can be aligned by shifting and scaling operations , but fails for sharp or heavytailed temporal sequences . Moreover , if two time series share select L PLC models from them . After fixing individual PLC parameters with Lasso , we solve the following quadratic programming ( QP ) problem to obtain the corresponding weight w for each PLC model : min w ky −fKwk2 , st w` ≥ 0 , wi = 1 ,
LXi=1 where fK ∈ RT ×L is the selected L basis functions from
K . We call this entire Lasso based fitting framework as PLC Lasso .
IV . CLUSTERING BUZZES USING K MPLC
In this section , we first propose three types of features for characterizing buzz time series . Then , in order to discover underlying similar patterns in a set of buzz time series , we propose a novel probabilistic graphical model , K Mixture of Product Life Cycle ( K MPLC ) , to cluster N time series based on their PLC parameters .
A . Feature Extraction
We obtain estimated model parameters w , α , β , and µ for each buzz time series sequence using the PLC Lasso . However , some of those parameters may not be useful for buzzes clustering . For example , if buzz time series are not aligned according to their peak positions , location of each PLC model varies , and it may not be possible to obtain meaningful clusters using absolute PLC locations . Thus , in this paper , we propose three types of effective and robust features for characterizing buzz time series sequences .
Weight parameters : To capture the shape information of a time series sequence , we use the normalized weight parame parameters relies on the number of PLC models . ters obtained by PLC Lasso fitting bw . The number of weight
Inverse β of the maximum PLC : To discriminate sharp tailed and heavy tailed buzz sequences , we propose the following feature :
τ = β−1 imax
,
( t ≥ µ ) ( Others )
. where imax is the index of the largest PLC with respect to weight w .
Standard deviation of PLC locations : To discriminate buzz time series with single peak from multiple peaks , we propose the following feature : where L is the number of PLC models , w = [ w1 , . . . , wL]> denotes the weight vector , > denotes the matrix transpose , α = [ α1 , . . . , αL]> and β = [ β1 , . . . , βL]> are the vectors of Gamma distribution parameters , µ = [ µ1 , . . . , µL]> refers to locations of PLC models , and Z is the normalization factor .
C . Mixtures of PLC Model Estimation
Let us denote buzz time series as y = [ y1 , . . . , yT ]> , where T refers to the length of time series . Note , in this paper , we t=1 yt = 1 ) , so that it can be modeled by probability density functions . Then , the optimization problem of fitting the buzz time series using a mixture of PLC models can be formulated as : assume time series are normalized ( ie,PT min w,α,β,µ
( yt − f ( t ; w , α , β , µ))2
TXt=1 st α` > 0 , β` > 0 , w` > 0 , µ` > 0 , ` = 1 , 2 , . . . , L .
We can solve this optimization problem by using gradient descent . However , since this optimization problem is nonconvex , it tends to lead to poor local optimum solutions .
To deal with the non convexity problem , we first relax the problem to a convex optimization problem and then propose a Lasso based approach [ 23 ] , making it possible to obtain a global solution . The idea of the Lasso based approach is to select L PLC models from a large number of PLC candidates . More specifically , we first define T MαMβ basis functions , where Mα and Mβ are the number of candidate values for α and β , so that each basis function corresponds to a PLC model with fixed α and β parameters placed at µ . Note that , since a PLC model can be located at any of T positions , the total number of basis functions is T MαMβ .
Then , we solve the following optimization problem : min ky − Kvk2 + λkvk1 v st v` ≥ 0 , ` = 1 , 2 , . . . , T MαMβ ,
( 3 ) where v ∈ RT MαMβ is the model parameter and K ∈ RT ×T MαMβ is the pre computed Gamma distribution functions :
Kt,µ×i×j =( Z −1
0 ij ( t − µ)eαi−1e−eβj(t−µ )
In the above 1)eαi−1e−eβj ( t−1)}T t=1 ) formula , Zij
= is the normalization max({(t − factor , eαi , i = 1 , . . . , Mα and eβj , j = 1 , . . . , Mβ are pre defined Gamma parameters , µ is the location index of a PLC model ( t − µ indicates the shift of a PLC along x axis ) , and kvk1 is the L1 regularizer to avoid overfitting . Since the optimization problem of Eq ( 3 ) is convex with respect to v , Eq ( 3 ) can be solved by using a state of the art Lasso optimization solver . In this paper , we employ the dual augmented Lagrangian ( DAL ) based approach [ 24 ] . Since we use the L1 regularizer , we can select a small number of non overlapped basis functions .
After the Lasso fitting , we first obtain M PLC models ( M > L ) with using a small regularization parameter , and then
σ =vuut 1

B . K MPLC
To discover the underlying similar patterns of buzz timeseries , we propose a probabilistic graphical model , K Mixture of Product Life Cycle ( K MPLC ) , to cluster N time series into K groups . Throughout this paper , we assume K is known .
Fig 2 . Graphical Model of K MPLC .
Suppose that we are given N buzz time series and their corresponding parameters W = [ w1 , . . . , wN ] ∈ RL×N , τ ∈ RN , and σ ∈ RN . Given distinct characteristics over different parameter vectors , we use a Dirichlet distribution to model the weight vector w as its sum needs to be 1 . Since τ and σ take positive values , we use the Gamma distribution to model them separately . The graphical model we propose is shown in Figure 2 .
Specifically , the probability for each instance is : p(w,τ,σ|π,Θ,a,b,a0,b0 ) =

πkp(w|θk)p(τ |ak , bk)p(σ|a0 k , b0 k ) .
Here , π = [ π1 , . . . , πK]> are the mixture weights , and p(w|θk ) = C(θk ) p(τ |ak , bk ) = p(σ|a0 k , b0 k ) = bak k Γ(ak ) b0 k Γ(a0 a0 k k ) wθki−1 i

In this paper , we use maximum likelihood estimation to estimate the model parameters . Specifically , the optimization problem for the proposed model can be given as : distributions , C(θ ) ta−1e−tdt .
= vector y is generated iid from a multivariate normal distribution , then GMM would be a reasonable baseline as well ; K SC , which is the state of the art algorithm for buzz timeseries clustering , provides a more competitive comparison point . SpikeM [ 19 ] , which is the state of the art algorithm for buzz time series modeling , is considered another baseline . As SpikeM does not handle time series clustering , we concatenate all parameters extracted by SpikeM as features for K means and GMM , and we denote them as SpikeM+K means and SpikeM+GMM respectively . We also compare with a DTWbased anytime clustering algorithm [ 26 ] , which is denoted as DTW+Spectral , whose basic idea is first to generate a DTW matrix to measure the non metric distance between any two time series , then apply a spectral clustering algorithm on the DTW matrix . In addition , we concatenate all the PLC Lasso features w , τ , and σ and use them as features for Kmeans and GMM , and we denote them as Lasso+K means and Lasso+GMM . We denote our proposed method as Lasso+KMPLC , where we set α to be 1 and β can take values of [ 0.1 , 0.2 , . . . , 1.0 ] in our experiments . To avoid fluctuation due to random factors , we set the initialization of GMM and KMPLC to be the clustering indexing of K means . In addition , we run all experiments 10 times , and report the average evaluation metrics .
Dataset : To evaluate the effectiveness of the K MPLC algorithm , we select thousands of high frequency search queries as candidate buzz topics and collect mentions from social media sites from June 22nd to August 8th , 2012 . Considering the number of mentions of a topic per hour , we generated a timeseries sequence for the topic within a time window . If the number of mentions at time t in a topic is 10 times higher than the average mention numbers in the past 48 hours , we regard the topic at that time as a buzz topic . According to [ 14 ] , [ 4 ] , hot topics on social media lose their attraction quickly , therefore , we select a time window of 72 hours , and obtain a 72 dimension time series sequence y for each buzz topic . Finally , we collected the general buzz dataset , which contains 534 buzz time series : most of them are celebrity names , such as Michael Phelps and Tyler Perry ; the rest are event names , such as Euro 2012 and UFC 148 . In our experiments , timeseries sequences are not aligned according to their peaks . That is , the data set used in this paper is a more challenging dataset than the one used for K SC [ 25 ] . All time series in the dataset are manually labeled into 5 clusters based on their distinct temporal shapes : time series containing single sharp peak are labeled as 1 ; sequences with single heavy tailed peak are labeled as 2 ; curves with double sharp peaks are labeled as 3 ; time series containing double peaks ( at least one is heavytailed ) are labeled as 4 ; time series with more than 3 peaks are labeled as 5 . max

In this paper we use the expectation maximization ( EM ) algorithm to solve this problem .
V . CLUSTERING EXPERIMENTS
Methods : We compare the proposed K MPLC algorithm with K means algorithm , Gaussian mixture model ( GMM ) [ 2 ] , and K SC [ 25 ] . K means , which is a general clustering algorithm , is considered as a baseline ; if we assume each time series
Evaluation Metrics : We use Adjusted Rand Index ( ARI ) and Normalized Mutual Information ( NMI)[11 ] , where both metrics are the larger the better .
Evaluation Results : Figure 3 ( a ) shows the clustering results of different algorithms on the general buzz dataset . In this experiment , each time series sequence is modeled by a mixture of 3 PLC models . It clearly shows that Lasso+K MPLC performs the best among all algorithms : its ARI and NMI scores are 0.2714 and 0.2628 , which is much better than others . KSC performs the second best among all algorithms . Although SpikeM provides good results for time series modeling , its parameters are not effective as features for K means or GMM . In order to figure out the effectiveness of PLC Lasso and KMPLC separately , we also combine PLC Lasso parameters as features with existing clustering methods . With the help of PLC Lasso based features , Lasso+K means and Lasso+Kmeans compare favorably with K SC , and their metrics gaps to Lasso+K MPLC indicates the effectiveness of K MPLC .
To further compare the proposed algorithm with other baseline approaches , we change the number of existing cluster labels in the data set to obtain more experimental results .
• 4 label clustering ground truth : we combine the sequences originally labeled as 3 and 4 into the same cluster , while the remaining is the same .
• 3 label clustering ground truth ( different number of peaks ) : we combine the sequences originally labeled as 1 and 2 into one cluster , combine the sequences originally labeled as 3 and 4 into another same cluster , and leave the remaining the same .
• 2 label clustering ground truth ( Single peak vs . multiple peaks ) : we combine the sequences originally labeled as 1 and 2 into one cluster , and combine the sequences originally labeled as 3 , 4 and 5 into the other cluster .
Comparing with Figure 3 ( a) (d ) , overall , the observations are quite consistent : the Lasso based approach shows its effectiveness on K means and GMM ; DTW + Spectral usually performs the 2nd best among all , and the DTW based approach is more robust than K SC on this dataset ; K MPLC always performs the best . Notice that , with decreasing of cluster numbers K , the difficulty of clustering also decreases . In our experiment , the absolute evaluation metrics of K MPLC is increasing ( ARI is 0.2930 when K = 5 , and ARI is 0.3857 when K = 2 ) , which also shows the effectiveness of our proposed method . On the other hand , K SC and DTW+Spectral perform worse when K is smaller , such as K = 2 . One possible reason is that one of two clusters consists of single sharp peak and single fat peak sequences . More specifically , for KSC and DTW+Spectral , the distance between single sharp peak sequences and single fat peak sequences can be larger than the one between single sharp peak sequences and multiple peaks sequences , and thus single peak and multiple peaks tends to be clustered together .
Figure 4 illustrates the clustering results with different PLC numbers L . In this experiment , it is clear that each sequence with a mixture of 3 PLC models consistently outperforms that of using 2 or 4 PLC models . One possible explanation is that in our general buzz dataset , as the ground truth is to differentiate curves with 1 peak or 2 peaks from 3 or more peaks , representing each time series sequence as a mixture of 3 PLC models is the most appropriate , while leveraging 4 PLC models might bring in more noisy information , and leveraging 2 PLC models are least robust .
VI . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper , we presented our study to model the sudden spikes and heavy tailed patterns of buzz events on social media with product life cycle models ( PLC ) . Specifically , we model a time series sequence with a mixture of PLC models , and propose an efficient Lasso based parameter estimation approach . Then , we proposed a novel probabilistic model to cluster buzz time series with similar temporal patterns into the same group based on the features obtained from the mixture of PLC models . A novelty of the proposed approach is that it can distinguish a buzz time series sequence with a sharp peak from a buzz sequence with a heavy tailed peak , and our proposed method significantly outperforms the current stateof the art algorithms on the buzz clustering tasks .
Our work can be extended as follows . First , we can use a group regularizer instead of the L1 regularizer to model buzz time series , which is the most promising future direction . Second , since the Gamma distribution function is not suited for modeling the slow rising trend in the introduction stage or growth stage of a product , it would be interesting to explore other PLC models . Third , in this paper , we only deal with a segment of time series within a fix size of time window . In the future , we will leverage PLC model to split a long time series sequence into different segments , and combine with social media content to mine more interesting findings .
