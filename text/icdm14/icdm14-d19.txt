Abstract—The emergence of social networks has provided opportunities for both targeted marketing and viral marketing . By concentrating the efforts on a few key customers , targeted marketing could make the promotion of the items ( products ) much easier and more cost effective . On the other hand , viral marketing aims at ¿nding a set of individuals ( seeds ) to maximize the word of mouth propagation of an item . However , these two marketing strategies can only exploit some speci¿c characteristics of the social networks , and the problem of how to combine them together to build a better , stronger business is still open . To that end , in this paper , we propose a general approach for integrated marketing . Speci¿cally , to market a given item , we ¿rst generate the item speci¿c candidate users by a recommendation algorithm , and then select the typical users who have the best balanced utility scores and consumption/social entropy . Next , treating typical users as targeted customers , we study the problem of maximizing information awareness in viral marketing with these constrained targets . Along this line , we de¿ne it as a constrained coverage maximization problem , and propose three solutions : GMIC , LMIC and QMIC . Finally , extensive experimental results on real world datasets demonstrate that our integrated marketing approach could outperform the methods that consider only targeted marketing or viral marketing .
I . INTRODUCTION
Due to the highly fragmented mass media in today ’s society , reaching consumers by traditional marketing strategies ( eg , via print advertising and TV commercials ) is increasingly dif¿cult [ 1 ] . Meanwhile , the rapid growth of online user population on the Internet and mobile social world ( eg , Facebook ) has attracted a great deal of attention and interest from marketers [ 2]–[6 ] .
Indeed , there are generally two reasons that online social networks have become new resources and platforms for marketing . First , as the worlds of daily life , online life and the Internet technology become more inextricably linked , a rich set of pro¿les ( eg , the consumption histories and the social status ) from a large number of social users are available for creative use in automatic marketing . For instance , these users and their pro¿les could help generate customer segments accurately , and one step further , pave the way for successful targeted marketing . Speci¿cally , targeted marketing identi¿es the typical customers and concentrates the marketing efforts WContact Author .

350 on these customers . Thus , it could make the promotion of the items easier and more cost effective [ 7 ] ; Second , the user communications , and more generally , the diffusion of information in social networks can be utilized to design pro¿table viral marketing strategies , since the information diffusion of some customers may inÀuence other ’s purchasing decisions . Particularly , viral marketing identi¿es the seed users with the strongest inÀuence in the network to maximize the word ofmouth propagation of a product [ 4 ] .
Though both targeted marketing and viral marketing are more effective than marketing directly to a speci¿c person [ 4 ] ( eg , via personalized recommendation [ 8] ) , they could only exploit some speci¿c characteristics of the social networks and have limited marketing performance . For instance , targeted marketing may miss some potential customers with high utilities , and in contrast , viral marketing could waste the time and energy on a large scale of unpro¿table social users . Thus , it is necessary to integrate these two marketing strategies together to build a better , stronger business . Actually , one straightforward way for an integrated marketing is to ¿rst ¿nd a set/segment of the targeted users for targeted marketing , and then conduct viral marketing on these targeted users and other users in the social network . As a matter of fact , there are several challenges inherent in designing and implementing such a combined marketing strategy . First , since the number of potential users to an item may be huge , a common challenge is to select only a set of the most interested users for targeted marketing . The implicit constraint is that these targeted users should be both relevant and diverse , as this is the only way to precisely cover as many different users as possible . Second , different from the traditional viral marketing strategies where a set of the global inÀuential seed users are selected , in our scenario , the seed users not only should be inÀuential in the entire network but also should “ cover ” as many targeted users as possible . Thus , how to measure the effectiveness of the seed users becomes another challenge .
To address the challenges mentioned above , in this paper , we propose an integrated marketing approach . Speci¿cally , to market a given item , we ¿rst generate many candidate users by a recommendation algorithm ( ie , item based collaborative ¿ltering ) . Then , we select a small set of typical users for targeted marketing from these candidate users by balancing the utility scores and the entropy . Here , the utility of one candidate user is also measured by collaborative ¿ltering , and the entropy of the entire user set could be computed based on multiple features ( eg , preference diversity and social diversity ) . Then , treating typical users as constraints , we study the problem of maximizing information awareness in viral marketing with these constrained targets . Speci¿cally , we formulate this constrained viral marketing as a constrained coverage maximization problem . In addition to proposing a naive greedy solution , we also establish mathematically sound approximations and bounds , which lead to convex optimization and globally optimal solutions . Finally , extensive experimental results on real world datasets demonstrate that our integrated marketing approach outperforms the methods considering only targeted marketing or viral marketing .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the ¿rst attempt on a comprehensive study of marketing strategies that integrate targeted marketing and viral marketing in online social networks . Speci¿cally , our solution identi¿es the most pro¿table potential users and accordingly selects the most inÀuential seeds to optimize the marketing performance . Meanwhile , the proposed integrated marketing approach is a general framework and each step is open to some other algorithms .
II . RELATED WORK
The related literature can be grouped into two categories . The ¿rst category includes the related works of exploiting online social networks for improving marketing performance . The second category includes a brief discussion of the studies on maximum set coverage .
Typically ,
Marketing on Online Social Networks . Designing marketing strategies using social network analysis has been studied by employing various techniques and approaches , eg , marketing through the media like emails [ 9 ] , social events [ 10 ] , social search engine [ 11 ] and social web pages [ 12 ] . However , the vast amount of information tends to overwhelm marketers [ 13 ] , and it is essential to ¿gure out one or a few customer segments to target . Therefore , comparing to the entire marketing process ( a set of activities for choosing target markets , understanding user behavior and providing superior user value ) , we mainly focus on reviewing the marketing strategies by identifying the targeted customers . the decision of whether or not to a particular user is based solely on his/her pro¿les or the population segment to which he/she belongs [ 4 ] . For each marketing effort , the ¿rst critical challenge is to accurately infer user pro¿les based on the data available in social networks ( eg , social connections ) [ 14 ] or the implicit information revealed by the user generated content on the web ( eg , the style preferences ) [ 15 ] . User pro¿le not only includes the information about user demographics , but also consists of user ’s social status , personal interests and preferences , etc . For instance , for marketing to the enterprise customers , Zeng et al . proposed to infer users’ employment af¿liation information from social activities by a classi¿cation method [ 16 ] . Cho et al . developed a way of modeling social user mobility , and this to market model could reliably predict the locations and dynamics of customer movement [ 17 ] . Jamali et al . designed a random walk model combining the trust based and the collaborative ¿ltering approach for inferring customer preference [ 18 ] . Actually , most of the techniques like classi¿cation and sequence discovery in data mining could be applied to customer segmentation and selection [ 19 ] . After segmenting customers , marketers can now offer differentiated marketing strategies to the targeted customer groups , such as personalized recommendation [ 8 ] , [ 20 ] , price advertising [ 21 ] and viral marketing [ 22 ] .
Viral marketing takes advantage of the fact that customers in social networks are strongly inÀuenced by the opinions of their peers . Thus , we could inexpensively promote a new product by marketing primarily to a set of the seed users with the strongest inÀuence [ 4 ] . Along this line , there are generally three types of research directions : measuring the information transition probability between two neighbors [ 23 ] , modeling the information propagation process [ 6 ] , [ 24]–[26 ] , and applying social inÀuence to viral marketing [ 22 ] . Though it is important to learn the inÀuence propagation probability between two neighbors , this problem is beyond the scope of this paper , and we mainly focus on the second and the third directions . For describing the dynamics of information propagation , the idea of Independent Cascade(IC ) model [ 25 ] and Linear Threshold ( LT ) model [ 26 ] are widely used . Unfortunately , the inÀuence spread ( ie , the expected number of nodes that will be inÀuenced ) computation under these models is #P hard [ 6 ] . Thus , Monte Carlo simulation , which is very time consuming , is employed to approximate the inÀuence . To avoid Monte Carlo simulation , Aggarwal et al . [ 27 ] proposed a stochastic information Àow model , and Xiang et al . [ 28 ] proposed a linear social inÀuence ( Linear ) model . Due to the inef¿ciency of traditional information propagation models , most of existing work on viral marketing ( also called as social inÀuence maximization ) has to make a tradeoff between effectiveness and ef¿ciency . The typical approaches include CELF [ 29 ] , PMIC [ 6 ] , SIMPATH [ 30 ] , IRIE [ 31 ] and UBLF [ 32 ] . To the best of our knowledge , only Ref . [ 33 ] studies the problem of viral marketing with some constrained target users . Unlike our scenario , Ref . [ 33 ] tries to ¿nd the minimum size seed set for activating at least a given number of nodes in the targeted set .
Maximum Coverage Problem . Actually , the above social inÀuence maximization problem ( viral marketing ) is a variant of the set cover problem which has been well studied [ 34 ] . The reason is that this type of problems has broad applications , such as recommendation [ 35 ] , ensemble pruning [ 36 ] , tag selection [ 37 ] , and document summary [ 38 ] . Though these problems are generally NP hard , the optimization functions are usually monotone and submodular . Thus , using a simple greedy algorithm we could achieve a solution that is guaranteed to have an approximation ratio of ( h 1)@h 0=6321 ( here ,h is the base of the natural logarithm ) . However , if there are some constraints , eg , budgets [ 39 ] , prior domain knowledge [ 40 ] or the must cover constraint ( as shown in this paper ) , more complex solutions should be designed .

With graph J , viral marketing uses the inÀuence propagation models ( including IC [ 25 ] , LT [ 26 ] and Linear [ 28 ] ) to compute the inÀuence spread fl for each node l following 0 , some de¿ned rules . Speci¿cally , fl = [ il$1> il$2> ===> il$q ] a q × 1 vector , denotes the inÀuence distribution of node l on each node in the network . Thus , the total inÀuence spread of node l in network equals to the sum of the inÀuence of m5Y il$m . We can node l to other nodes , namely il$Y = see that il$Y is actually the expected number of the nodes that will be inÀuenced by l . Now , let ’s take Linear model as an example for illustrating the computation of il$m and il$Y [ 28 ] : if l equals to m , then il$m = l ( eg , 1 ) and l is the prior self con¿dence of node l for spreading the wnmil$n , where information ; Otherwise , il$m = gm Qm = {x 5 Y | ( x> m ) 5 H} and parameter gm 5 ( 0> 1 ] is the damping coef¿cient . Thus , the computation of il$m follows an iterative process , and the iterative computation for the entire fl ( also il$Y ) quickly converges in R(|H| ) time . n5Qm
P
Given the il$Y computed by a speci¿c inÀuence propagation model , traditional work on viral marketing usually aims at ¿nding a set of seed nodes V ( V Y and |V| = NV ) with the biggest iV$Y . In this way , if using the seeds in V to spread the information , we could get the maximum inÀuence spread , ie , the expected number of successfully inÀuenced nodes .
However , there are two limitations of the traditional methods . First , the seeds with the maximum inÀuence spread may not result in the maximized information awareness on the network . Let ’s consider an example as shown in Fig 2 , where we have a toy social network and two seed candidates highlighted in black for viral marketing , ie , node 1 and node 2 . Fig 2(a ) and Fig 2(b ) illustrate the simulated inÀuence spread results for these two candidate seeds , respectively . Since node 1 successfully made node 4 , 5 and 6 active ( Fig 2(a) ) , and node 2 only inÀuenced node 4 and 5 ( Fig 2(b) ) , thus node 1 will be chosen as the seed for inÀuence spread . However , if we observe the network more carefully , we could ¿nd that it may be more appropriate to choose node 2 as the seed rather than node 1 . The reason is that node 2 ’s inÀuence spread distribution is much more balanced than node 1 , and thus it has the ability to make more people aware of the speci¿c information . Here , we could measure the information awareness by the probability that targeted node knows about the information ( eg , about an item ) , and this is a relaxed de¿nition of “ being inÀuenced ” ( which could be interpreted as really buying that item ) . Actually , in some marketing and advertising applications [ 3 ] , [ 33 ] , the service providers care

In this section , we ¿rst give the preliminaries and problem formulation . Then , we describe the integrated marketing approach in detail . Actually , Fig 1 shows the Àowchart of the proposed marketing approach . Given the item for marketing , we ¿rst generate many candidate users that may like this item ( eg , the users with high utilities ) by a recommendation algorithm . Since the number of these candidate users is usually too large for effective marketing , we then select a comparably small set of targeted users ( typical users , eg , users 1 , 2 , 3 in the ¿gure ) for targeted marketing by jointly modeling their utility scores and entropy . Next , we treat these targeted users as constraints when conducting viral marketing . Thus , we select a set of seed users ( eg , users 4 , 5 , 6 in the ¿gure ) , the inÀuence of whom could not only cover the targeted users but also cover as many other users as possible . In this way , marketing on these seed users will lead to both the maximum adoption and maximum information awareness of this item . Each step is illustrated in the following subsections . For better illustration , Table I lists some mathematical notations .
A . Problem Statement and Formulation .
1 ) Preliminaries : For better introducing our integrated marketing approach , we ¿rst show the general notations and issues related to the traditional social inÀuence modeling and social marketing problem . Here , we start from viral marketing , ie , the social inÀuence maximization problem . Assume J = ( Y> H> T ) is a social network , where Y = {1> 2> ===> q} is the node/user set and edge set H represents all the connections between nodes . T = [ wlm]q q is the transition matrix for information propagation , ie , wlm represents the information propagation probability from node l to node m . If there is a connection from l to m in H , then wlm A 0 , otherwise wlm = 0 . Note that we assume T is given in this paper . Also , J is usually assumed to be directed , as inÀuence propagation is speci¿c to direction in the most general case [ 27 ] .

6 more about the number of people aware of their products rather than just the expected number of inÀuenced ones . That is , we should also pay attention to the real distribution of the information spread fl of candidate seed l .
Second , the selected seeds may not cover some important users with high utilities ( ie , the users that have high probability of buying this speci¿c item ) . For instance , suppose we now want to promote a game product on the social network shown in Fig 2 and we know that node 3 ( a teenage boy ) is possibly interested in this game , then we should also choose node 2 as the seed for marketing rather than node 1 , since the inÀuence of node 2 could cover the targeted node 3 very well . In summary , in some real world scenarios , it is important to make more people aware of the speci¿c information , and also some of the important individuals ( the targeted users selected in targeted marketing ) must be covered ( ie , they should be inÀuenced by the selected seeds so as to be aware of this information ) . To that end , in the following , we explain the formulations of our integrated marketing approach .
2 ) Problem Formulation : First , we introduce an asymmetry “ information awareness matrix ” U , where Uml = 1 if node m is covered by node l , and Uml = 0 otherwise . Here , the “ coverage ” is measured by the pairwise inÀuence strength , ie , if il$m A w ( w is a threshold ( eg , 0=1 ) ) then we assume node m is covered by node l and Uml = 1 . In other words , under the inÀuence of node l , node m becomes aware of this information . Actually , il$m can be computed by any existing inÀuence model , eg , Linear [ 28 ] . According to the previous discussion ( eg , the example shown in Fig 2 ) , the bene¿ts of using U rather than il$m are : First , the balance of the inÀuence distribution could be considered . Thus , we may evaluate the performance of the candidate seeds more precisely ; Second , the ¿nal goal of the integrated social marketing could be more easily achieved , as we can conveniently judge if one targeted node is covered or not . However , there is also one underlying shortage of U : When evaluating a set of seeds , the effect of inÀuence enrichment between these seeds are not included ( ie , il$m ? w and in$m ? w , while i{l>n}$m maybe larger than w ) . Since the seeds are usually far away from each other in the social network and there are limited inÀuence enrichment , we just omit this phenomenon in this paper .
Then , the problem of the non constrained information awareness maximization problem can be formulated as : kUsk0> max s where s is a q × 1 vector , representing whether the node l is selected as a seed ( sl = 1 ) or not ( sl = 0 ) . In practice this maximization problem is often constrained by the number of selected seed nodes , eg , NV : X
10s = l sl = NV> where 1 5 R q×1 is a vector of ones .
In targeted marketing , denote X as the set of targeted customers that must be covered by the selected seeds , then we have another constraint :
{Us}m 1> ; m 5 X=
In summary , the problem that we would like to optimize for the integrated marketing is as follows
( 1 ) kUsk0> s max v=w= 10s = NV>
{Us}m 1> ;m 5 X> sl 5 {0> 1}> ;l 5 Y=
In the following , we ¿rst illustrate the strategy of selecting typical users X in targeted marketing . Then , we propose several solutions for this constrained information awareness maximization problem to get better marketing performance . B . Targeted Marketing
In this subsection , we describe the way of selecting typical users X for targeted marketing by jointly modeling the customers’ utility scores and their entropy .
1 ) Problem Statement and Solution :
In this paper , we formulate the typical user selection problem as follows . Given an item for marketing and a small set of users W who have shown their preferences to this item ( eg , have bought this item in the training set ) , we seek another set of users X ( who have not expressed their preferences to this item , ie , X_O=B ) that are the most “ typical ” to the marketer in the context of marketing this item on the social network . is possible to represent “ typical ” by many different indicators . Without loss of generality , this paper focuses on two of them , one user level indicator : utility , and one setlevel indicator : diversity . The intuition is that a useful selection of typical users contains relevant users referring to the given item . Furthermore , the users should be able to cover most of the segmentations of the candidate users ( ie , with diverse characteristics ) . Then , the goal is to ¿nd a subset X that maximizes the objective function j(X ) :
It j(X ) = u(x ) + ( 1 )K0(X )>
( 2 )
X x5X where u(x ) represents the utility score of a user x and the diversity function K0(X ) is the normalized joint entropy of the entire set of users X . We balance them by specifying a parameter . The maximization problem is that :
X
= arg max
X_O=B >|X|=NX j(X )=
( 3 )
Before introducing the way of computing u and K0 , we should note that the above formulation is similar to that in
353
Ref . [ 41 ] , where a set of social media responses to online news articles are selected . Moreover , following the similar proof strategy given in Ref . [ 41 ] , the entropy of a user set is a monotonic non decreasing submodular function [ 42 ] . Combining with the way of computing u ( shown later ) , we could easily conclude that j(X ) is also a monotonic non decreasing submodular function . For this kind of function , we do not have to exhaustively search the space of all possible user subsets , but use a simple greedy algorithm which guarantees that the approximation is within ( 1 1@h ) of the optimal result . Initially , X = B and we select a set of candidate users by computing u(x ) . The candidate users are those who may prefer the given item in the near future . Having said that the number of candidate users are usually too large to market , and then we select the typical ones into X from these candidate users ( following Eq ( 2) ) : First , the user with the highest u(x ) is put into X . After that we iteratively add a new user x ( selected from the candidate user set ) , as long as x could provide the biggest boost into objective function j(X ) if it was added into the set X . This iterative process will keep running until the targeted user set size is NX .
2 ) Utility and Entropy Computation : We show the way of computing the utility score for a single user ( u(x ) ) and the entropy score for a set of users ( K0(X ) ) , respectively . First , given an item and a set of users W who have consumed this item , we use an item based collaborative ¿ltering [ 8 ] to compute u(x ) . As a kind of recommendation algorithm , item based collaborative ¿ltering could address the data sparsity problem very well and thus generate high quality candidate/relevant user recommendations to each item . Since the focus of this paper is not to devise more sophisticated means to calculate user item similarity , we choose Jaccard measure , which has performed well in binary preference data [ 43 ] . u(x ) = vlp(x> d ) = |Lx _ Ld|@|Lx ^ Ld|>
( 4 ) where Lx are the items that user x likes and Ld are the items that are most similar ( ie , often consumed together ) to item d . After that , candidate user set is generated by selecting top users with the largest Jaccard similarities .
Second , we show the way of computing K0(X ) , which is motivated by the method in Ref . [ 41 ] . Given a user set X and the features ( will be introduced later ) used to collectively select typical users , we treat these features as binary random variables . Let K0(X ) denote the normalized entropy of the user set X , and it is measured by K0(X ) = K(X )@orj(g ) , where g is the number of binary feature variables and K(X ) = Pg l=0 s(il = 1)orj(s(il = 1 ) ) and s(il = 1 ) is the probability that feature il has the value of 1 given all users in X . The intuition is that we favor adding the users with different non zero features from those already in X to increase diversity . In this paper , we focus on two types of features for computing the entropy , the consumption feature and the social feature . Speci¿cally , for the consumption feature , each item in the system stands for a feature variable , and if the given user consumed this item then il = 1 . For the social feature , each social user in the system is a feature variable , and if the given
354
At user has social connections with this user then il = 1 . We can see that these two features capture the diversity of typical user set from different aspects , ie , preference diversity and social diversity , respectively . last , could balance the effect between utility and entropy : if = 0 , the entropy is highlighted ; if = 1 , only the utility is considered . We should note that , this targeted marketing framework is a general and open model which could handle more indicators and features . C . Constrained Viral Marketing
We describe the solution for viral marketing to maximize the information awareness with the constraint that the targeted typical users must be covered . Unfortunately , optimizing the O0 norm in Eq ( 1 ) is NP hard , thus in the following we explore both natural heuristics and mathematically sound relaxations to derive the optimal solutions . Speci¿cally , we will introduce a naive greedy algorithm ( GMIC ) , and algorithms using linear ( LMIC ) and quadratic ( QMIC ) programming , respectively .
1 ) Greedy Algorithm ( GMIC ) : Our algorithm GMIC ( Greedy for Maximum Information Coverage ) for Eq ( 1 ) is a variant of the set cover solution . Initially , V = > . At each iteration , it adds a new node lpd{ into V ( ie , slpd{ # 1 ) , where lpd{ is selected from the nodes that maximize the increment on the coverage of the targeted users X . When there are multiple candidates maximizing the targeted coverage , we choose the one that leads to the maximum information coverage on the nodes of the entire network .

2 ) Linear Programming ( LMIC ) : Having said that the optimization of O0 norm is generally NP hard , we can replace the O0 norm with O1 norm , as done in BP ( Basis Pursuit ) [ 44 ] and Lasso ( least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ) [ 45 ] . Therefore , we would like to maximize kUsk1 = 10Us instead of kUsk0 . Also , there are several ways to relax the discrete constraints sl 5 {0> 1} . Here we adopt a simple approach with sl 5 [ 0> 1 ] . Once the relaxed s is returned , we can select the NV nodes with higher values in s . In summary , we would like to propose another solution LMIC ( Linear programming for Maximum Information Coverage ) by

3 ) Quadratic Programming ( QMIC ) : Indeed , the O1 norm is an upper bound of O0 norm in our problem . For the maximization problem , it is intuitively better to work with a lower bound . To this end , we provide the following lower bound of kUsk0 : Theorem 1 kUsk0 3
2 s0Ts , where T = U0U .

In the following , we call this solution as QMIC ( Quadratic programming for Maximum Information Coverage ) .
Actually , the biggest difference between the greedy algorithm ( GMIC ) and the approximating algorithms ( LMIC and QMIC ) is on their convexities . Both LMIC and QMIC are convex and will result in a global optimum respectively , only if the constraints could be satis¿ed . Here , we will leave the situation when those constraints may not be satis¿ed as a future work . In contrast , GMIC is non convex and it will stuck at a local optimal solution , which might be far away from better alternatives . In summary , GMIC is able to return a result for any situations without performance guarantee , while LMIC and QMIC could return the global optimized result under some constraints . Notice that , since both LMIC and QMIC are the approximating methods , their globally optimized results may not be better than the local output of GMIC ( this could be observed in the experiments ) .
IV . EXPERIMENTS
We conduct experiments on real world datasets to demonstrate : ( 1 ) The effects of parameter for typical user selection in targeted marketing ; ( 2 ) The performance of our integrated marketing algorithms ; ( 3 ) The overlap of the seed users . A . Experimental Setup Datasets . We choose two datasets from different domains : Ihou and Epinions . Ihou is an online Karaoke dataset that is collected from ihou.com1 , which contains all the singing ( consumption ) records of the users , and meanwhile , the users’ social connections ( follower followee relationships ) between July 2011 and April 2012 ; Epinions2 is a dataset about the user ratings on the articles and it also contains a directed user trust network [ 46 ] . Thus , the items for marketing are the songs or the articles , respectively . Detailed information of these datasets can be seen in Table II . We select the users who have consumed at least 5 items . Then , for each user ’s consumption record , we split it into a training set and a test set , by selecting the ¿rst 20 percentage of the consumption to be part of the training set and the remaining ones to be part of the test set . In this way , we could treat these items as the cold start products that need social marketing .

Benchmark Methods . Following their names in the step of viral marketing , we call the speci¿c algorithms under our proposed integrated marketing solution as GMIC , LMIC and QMIC , respectively . Speci¿cally , for each algorithm ( eg , GMIC ) , we ¿rst use Eq ( 2 ) to ¿nd typical users , and then select the corresponding constrained viral marketing strategy ( eg , GMIC ) . We compare with several benchmark methods : • TU is short for Targeted Users . In this method , we directly choose the typical users selected from targeted marketing as seeds for the following viral marketing .
• CELF is short for “ Cost Effective Lazy Forward ” [ 29 ] implemented under Independent Cascade ( IC ) model [ 25 ] . To the best of our knowledge , CELF ( a greedy algorithm ) is the most effective ( though not the ef¿cient one ) solution for the traditional viral marketing .
• RGMIC , RLMIC and RQMIC . These three methods are the GMIC , LMIC and QMIC with randomly selected typical users .
We use TU and CELF , which considers only targeted marketing or viral marketing , respectively , to demonstrate the bene¿ts provided by our integrated marketing approach . Meanwhile , the comparisons with RGMIC , RLMIC and RQMIC help us test the effectiveness of our selected typical users .
All the experiments were performed on a server of Windows 64 bit operating system with 2 GHz 24 Core Intel(R ) XeonR E5 2620 CPU and 128GB of main memory .

10 targeted typical users ( Targets Coverage ) , the coverage on the ground truth users , ie , the users in the test set ( Test Set Coverage ) ; and the coverage on other users in the entire network ( Global Coverage ) . Without loss of generality , we compute the information cover matrix U by the Linear inÀuence model [ 28 ] and the threshold w for measuring information awareness is set to be 0.1 for Ihou and 0.01 for Epinions ( according to the sparsity ) , respectively . Notice that , even the Linear algorithm is fast enough , it is still impossible to compute the inÀuence spread for all the nodes , since U will be too large . Thus , we ¿rst run PageRank [ 47 ] and only compute the inÀuence spread fl for 1,000 nodes with the highest PageRank values . In this way , we have 1,000 candidate seeds ( columns ) in U . For the sake of convenience , we let the size of the seed set be equal to the size of the typical user set ( N = NX = NV ) making sure that the constraints in LMIC and QMIC could be satis¿ed , and we choose comparatively small N ranging in [ 2,10 ] . Targets Coverage . Fig 5 shows the coverage results on targeted typical users . Since most of the solutions ( ie , GMIC , LMIC , QMIC , RGMIC , RLMIC , RQMIC and UT ) treat typical users as constraints when selecting seeds , they could certainly get the 100 % cover ratio on typical users as long as NV NX . For consistency , we denote all these methods as “ Constrained methods ” in Fig 5 . In contrast , the global optimization method CELF does not suffer from such a constraint . Thus , CELF could not cover most of the typical users , no matter what ( eg , 0 and 1 ) and datasets are used . Test Set Coverage . Fig 6 illustrates the ¿nal information coverage on the ground truth users . Here , the ground truth users are those that consumed this speci¿c item in the test set . Compared to the targets coverage , cover ratio on the test set is an even more straightforward metric for evaluating each marketing strategy . Fig 6(a) (d ) in the ¿rst line are the test set coverage results for Ihou and the four sub ¿gures in the second line are for Epinions . Since only methods GMIC , LMIC and QMIC are sensitive to parameter , we draw them under different settings ( ie , 0 , 0.5 , 1 ) . For better illustration3 , we split the benchmark methods into different sub¿gures , eg , CELF and UT are only compared in the ¿gure when = 0 . From Fig 6(a) (c ) we can see that our methods could cover much more users in the test set of Ihou for each . Similar results on Epinions could be also observed in Fig 6(e) (g ) .
Meanwhile , we investigate more details on the effect of tuning in terms of the cover ratio of the selected seeds .
3Actually , for both Test Set Coverage and Global Coverage , we magnify the results of benchmark UT 100 times to make it be comparable with others .

B . Typical User Selection
We compare the results of the typical user selection under different ( Eq ( 2) ) . For better measuring users’ utilities by Eq ( 4 ) , we focus on the items with |W| ( number of the users who have consumed this item in the training set ) larger than 10 . First , Fig 3 illustrates the average Jaccard similarities between the results under = 1 ( ie , no diversity is included ) and other ( in [ 0,1) ) . Speci¿cally , for each item and , we run Eq ( 2 ) to get a set of 10 typical users from the Top 50 candidate users with the highest u(x ) . The Jaccard similarity of the user sets and the Jaccard similarity of the consumed items of these user sets are reported . Similar results could be observed from both Fig 3(a ) and Fig 3(b ) : The smaller the , the bigger the difference between the user sets and the items . This implies that Eq ( 2 ) and the features that we use are able to help select different typical users under different , and these users also have different item preferences .
Second , we compare the different typical user selection results in terms of user recommendation . Here , we directly test if the N typical users selected by Eq ( 2 ) will ¿nally consume the given item or not , and we choose the “ Precision ” and “ Recall ” [ 8 ] as the evaluation metrics . These recommendation results under different is shown in Fig 4 . We take Ihou as an example and similar results could be observed from Epinions . We can see that precision decreases ( recall increases ) when the number of typical users becomes larger . This implies that our item based collaborative ¿ltering could estimate the user preference very well as the higher ranked users have more probability to consume the item . Another interesting observation is that the best recommendation performance is achieved when = 0 , while = 1 performs the worst . This means our method of introducing diversity could bene¿t both the recommendation accuracy and the information coverage of viral marketing ( this will be shown in the following ) . C . Marketing Performance Comparison
In this subsection , we compare the effectiveness and ef¿ciency of each marketing solution . Speci¿cally , we evaluate effectiveness from three different aspects : the coverage on the

To this end , we set ranging from 0 to 1 , with step 0.2 , and compute the corresponding cover ratio on test set with N=6 . The results on two datasets are shown in Fig 6(d ) and Fig 6(h ) , respectively . From these ¿gures we can see that adding diversity in our objective function Eq ( 2 ) could generally help select more typical users , since much more ground truth users in the test set are covered . According to these two ¿gures , it is better to set no bigger than 0=5 . Global Coverage . Indeed , test set coverage only measures the observed/direct pro¿t . When evaluating the marketing performance , the potential pro¿t is also an important metric and this can be measured by the expected information coverage on the entire network . The performance of each method under this metric ( ie , kUsk0 ) is reported in Fig 7 . Actually , the arrangement in Fig 7 is similar to that in Fig 6 . From this ¿gure ( ie , Fig 7(a) (c ) and Fig 7(e) (g) ) , we can see that our methods generally outperform the baselines . However , there is one exception , ie , CELF also performs very well on Epinions in Fig 7(e ) . The reason is that CELF outputs the seeds with the biggest inÀuence spread iV$Y ( ie , V5Y iV$m ) while our methods optimize the constrained information coverage with U . Thus , under this global coverage metric , CELF may perform better ( eg , as shown in Fig 7(e ) when the constraints dominate our selection ) or worse ( as shown in Fig 7(a ) when threshold w is large enough to make a big difference between inÀuence spread and information coverage ) than our methods . Also , the differences observed from some of the ¿gures seems to be small , that ’s because the range of the y coordinate ( Cover Num . ) is very large . Actually , these improvements are signi¿cant , eg , GMIC could cover 930 users more than CELF when N = 10 in Fig 7(e ) . Meanwhile , the global coverage
P also changes in terms of different ( Fig 7(d ) and Fig 7(h) ) , and the trend is similar to that in the test set coverage .
In summary , combining the results in Fig 5 , Fig 6 and Fig 7 , we conclude that : ( 1 ) Compared with the methods using randomly selected typical users ( ie , RMIC , RLMIC and RQMIC ) , the viral marketing methods with the typical users selected based on Eq ( 2 ) ( ie , GMIC , LMIC and QMIC ) could better cover the users in the test set and other users in the network . This again demonstrates that our objective function ( Eq ( 2 ) ) helps ¿nd both relevant and diversi¿ed typical users ; ( 2 ) The traditional viral marketing method ( ie , CELF ) can not deal with the scenarios when social marketing meets constrained customers , and the constrained customers are usually not inÀuential enough to spread the speci¿c information ( ie , UT ) . In contrast , our proposed solutions could maximize the information coverage with the constrained customers . ( 3 ) GMIC , LMIC and QMIC perform similarly , and their differences have been discussed in Section III C . Running Time . We compare the computational ef¿ciency , and the results are shown in Fig 8 . We only present the computing time of GMIC , LMIC and QMIC because the time cost of RGMIC , RLMIC and RQMIC are the same with these algorithms , and UT almost has no time consumption while CELF is too time consuming for a large number of MonteCarlo simulations . Similar results could be observed from Fig 8(a ) and Fig 8(b ) , where we can see that among our proposed algorithms , the naive greedy algorithm GMIC is the most ef¿cient for locating inÀuential seeds to market an item . D . Overlap of Seed Users
We provide a further understanding of the relations between each marketing solution . First , we record the selected seed users of each algorithm , and the seeds for all the items are summarized together to stand for this speci¿c method ( eg , GMIC ) . Then , the Jaccard similarity of these 7 seed sets are demonstrated in Fig 9 , and we do not show the results of UT algorithm , since its seeds ( ie , typical users ) have little overlap with others . Here , we ¿x the size of each seed set as

10 , and ¿x = 0 for GMIC , LMIC and QMIC . Meanwhile , we just show the results on Epinions dataset and the similar results on Ihou are omitted due to the limited space .
Several interesting observations could be found in Fig 9 . For instance , the seeds output by GMIC , LMIC and QMIC have high overlap with each other , and the random version of these methods ( ie , RGMIC , RLMIC and RQMIC ) also perform similarly . However , there is little overlap between these two types of algorithms . This implies that the different typical users will lead to different seed users for GMIC , LMIC and QMIC . Another observation is that CELF seems to be the most dissimilar one . Actually , as a non personalized marketing strategy , CELF only selects the global inÀuential nodes , and this is different from other methods which could generate seed users for each item . Meanwhile , it does not consider the inÀuence distribution of each candidate seed .
V . DISCUSSION
We discuss the advantages and limitations of this study . From the experimental results , we can see that the proposed integrated marketing approach works well for social marketing with constrained customers . Speci¿cally , the selected typical users are both relevant and diverse , and thus could represent the potential customers of one speci¿c item . Given these typical users as the constraints , our greedy method GMIC and the approximating algorithms ( LMIC and QMIC ) could lead to the maximum information coverage .
As a general framework , each step of our integrated marketing approach may be further improved in the future . First ,
358 in this paper , we only use limited information and metrics to select the typical users for targeted marketing . We believe this process should be much more complicated in the realworld marketing . Thus , we plan to incorporate more features and domain knowledge for the better de¿nition and selection of typical users . Second , the algorithms designed for viral marketing may not perform well when the size of the seed set is smaller than the size of the typical users . Since the programming methods ( LMIC and QMIC ) may ¿nd no feasible solutions , while the GMIC method can only return local solution without performance guarantee . Then , how to ¿nd reliable marketing solutions for such a situation will be a very challenging research problem . Third , the performance ( eg , robustness ) of our discoveries will be tested through more experiments . For instance , we plan to try more experimental settings ( using other inÀuence models to get U ) on even larger datasets . Last but not least , for better marketing , we would like to ¿gure out other factors(eg , contexts [ 48 ] or signi¿cant events ) beyond social inÀuence that have impact on the consumption behaviors of social customers .
VI . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we provided a focused study on the integrated social marketing problem . Our target is to maximize the information coverage of some of the carefully selected typical users and maximize the information coverage on the entire social network simultaneously . Along this line , we ¿rst generated many candidate users by item based collaborative ¿ltering . Then , we selected the typical users from these candidate users for targeted marketing , and this was ¿nished by balancing the users’ utility scores and their entropy . Next , we treated these item speci¿c typical users as constraints and proposed three viral marketing solutions , GMIC , LMIC and QMIC , for ¿nding a set of seed users to solve this constrained information awareness/coverage problem . Finally , extensive experimental results on real world social network datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed marketing approach . We hope this study could lead to more future work .
