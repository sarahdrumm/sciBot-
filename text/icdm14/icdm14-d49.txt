1 INTRODUCTION Social networks have received much attention these days . To understand and utilize the information in a social network , researches have developed various methods to capture the structure and characteristics of the network from different perspectives ( eg , [ 1]–[3] ) . Most social network analysis approaches focused on unsigned graphs , where an edge between two nodes represents a presence of a relationship ( eg , trust or friendship ) between two individuals . However , relationships could be inherently negative to express distrust or dislike . In this paper we turn our focus to signed networks with both positive and negative relationships .
Signed networks were originally used in anthropology and sociology to model friendship and enmity [ 4 ] . In the adjacency matrix A of a signed graph , aij = 1 if the two individuals like each other , aij = −1 if the two dislike each other , and aij = 0 if the two are indifferent .
In order to analyze signed graph , researchers extended some of those existing measures and algorithms for unsigned graph to fit with signed graphs . In [ 5 ] , the authors extended the definition of modularity on signed graph . They treated positive edges and negative edges separately as two individual graphs and define the null models for each of them following the definition in unsigned graph . The new null model for signed graph is thus defined as the difference between the two null models . They also developed a local greedy search method to detect communities in signed graphs , which adapted simulated annealing approach to maximize the signed modularity . Another work [ 6 ] showed spectral analysis of signed graphs by the extended definition of Laplacian matrix : L = |D| − A where |D| is ffl

Manuscript received ; revised diag{|d1|;··· ;|dn|} and |di| is the total number of positive or negative edges from node i . The authors extended Ratio Cut and Normalized Cut to signed graphs and also showed link sign prediction via different graph kernels . However , they failed to clearly relate the structures in signed graph with patterns in the spectral space .
In [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] , the authors conducted the spectral analysis of approximate k balanced signed graphs by applying matrix perturbation . In the ideal k balanced graph case , edges within one community ( inner community edges ) are all positive and edges across two communities ( inter community edges ) are all negative . Such a graph is called a k balanced graph where k denotes the number of communities . They treated the k balanced signed graph as a perturbed variant of a kblock graph and showed that communities are distinguishable in the spectral space of its signed adjacency matrix .
The community structure in a signed graph and its spectral space is the combined effect of both positive edges and negative edges . The works [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] only dealt with a special type of signed networks , ie , k balanced networks where negative connections exist across communities and positive connections exist inside communities . In this paper , we present a spectral analysis framework for analyzing community structures of complex signed networks and show how the negative edges affect distributions and patterns of node spectral coordinates in the spectral space . Specifically , we study the community structure of the following two types of signed networks and demonstrate they are clusterable in their spectral spaces .
• Type I : inner community connections are dense with positive edges whereas inter community connections are mixed with both positive and negative edges .
• Type II : inner community connections are absent or very sparse whereas inter community connections are dense with negative edges . A k partite graph with disputing communities ( termed as k dispute ) is an ideal case of such graph where the relationship such as untrust and dispute mainly exist between communities and rarely inside communities .
Our contributions are two fold . First , we theoretically prove the clusterability of community structure in signed adjacency spaces of the above two types of signed networks . We have found that both types of signed networks demonstrate significant k orthogonal cluster patterns in the kdimensional spectral subspace spanned by the eigenvectors corresponding to the largest absolutes of eigenvalues . We give out theoretical explanation of the patterns and show them with illustration examples to verify the findings . Second , the discovered orthogonality property in the adjacency eigenspace has potential for a series of applications . In this paper , we present an effective graph partition algorithm , UniAdjCluster , which utilizes the cluster orthogonality property in the adjacency eigenspace . The idea is to project node coordinates to the unit sphere in the spectral space and then apply the classic k means to find clusters . Our empirical evaluations on synthetic data and real world social networks validate our theoretical findings and show the effectiveness of our graph partition algorithm .
2 RELATED WORK There is also a large literature on examining the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian or normal matrix for unsigned networks with various applications such as spectral clustering [ 9]–[13]and graph visualization [ 14 ] . In spectral analysis of the Laplacian matrix or the normal matrix , the coordinates are arranged to make the sum of all the distance between two nodes smallest . In their projection spaces , closely related nodes are pulled together to form clusters . Many spectral clustering methods , which exploit this cluster property , have been developed including ratio cut , normalized cut , and min max cut ( refer to a recent tutorial [ 15] ) .
Different from the Laplacian matrix or normal matrix , the properties of the adjacency eigenspace have only received attentions in some recent work including the orthogonal line patterns [ 16]–[19 ] , fraud detection [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , and spectral graph visualization [ 22 ] . The authors in [ 16 ] found an EigenSpoke pattern wherein , when plotted the the singular vectors of graphs against each other , they have clear , separate lines that neatly align along specific axes . EigenSpokes are associated with the presence of a large number of tightly knit communities embedded in very sparse graphs . The authors in [ 17 ] showed that 1 ) node coordinates in the projected spectral space of the adjacency matrix of approximate k block graphs locate along k quasiorthogonal lines ; and 2 ) nodes within one community form a line that goes through the origin in the k dimensional space .
In [ 17 ] , the authors demonstrated the line orthogonality pattern in the adjacency eigenspace of approximate k block graphs . Specifically they showed that 1 ) spectral coordinates of nodes with no direct links to other communities locate exactly on the orthogonal lines ; 2 ) spectral coordinates of nodes with links to other communities deviate from lines ; and 3 ) for a network with k communities there exist k orthogonal lines ( and each community forms one line ) in the spectral subspace formed by the first k eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix . In [ 19 ] , the authors further gave explicit formula ( as well as its conditions ) to quantify how
2 much orthogonal lines rotate from the canonical axes and how far spectral coordinates of nodes with direct links to other communities deviate from the line of their own community . The authors developed spectrum based fraud detection methods that exploit the spectral space of the adjacency matrix of the underlying network topology to identify random link attacks [ 20 ] and subtle anomalies [ 21 ] . In [ 22 ] , the authors explored the use of both the features of node distribution and coordinates in the spectral space for network visualization .
In signed networks , most research is based on balance theory which can be viewed as a model of likes and dislikes . For example , in [ 23 ] , the authors showed that the stability of sentiments is equivalent to k balanced graphs . In [ 24 ] , the authors studied signed networks based on status theory where a positive directed link indicates that the creator of the link views the recipient as having higher status and a negative directed link indicates that the recipient is viewed as having lower status .
3 BACKGROUND
3.1 Notation
A signed network or graph G is a set of n nodes connected by a set of m links which could be positive or negative . The network considered here is symmetric , connected , and without self loops . It can be represented as the symmetric adjacency matrix An×n with aij = 1( 1 is also included for signed graph ) if node i is connected to node j and aij = 0 otherwise . Let i be the i th eigenvalue of the symmetric adjacency matrix A and xi the corresponding eigenvector . The eigenvalues are arranged in certain sequence according to the type of the graphs . xij denotes the j th entry of i ixixT xi . The spectral decomposition of A is A = i . It has been known that there is an intimate relationship between the combinatorial characteristics of a graph and the algebraic properties of its adjacency matrix ( refer to surveys [ 25 ] , [ 26] ) .
∑
Formula ( 1 ) illustrates the notation . The eigenvector xi is represented as a column vector . In most social networks , there exist k leading eigenvalues that have value or magnitude significantly greater than the rest ones . The corresponding eigenvectors xi ( i = 1;··· ; k ) contain most topological information of the original graph in the spectral space . The k dimensional spectral space is spanned by ( x1;··· xk ) . When we project node u in this kdimensional subspace with xi as the basis , the row vector ffu = ( x1u ; x2u;··· ; xku ) is its coordinate of in this subspace . We call ffu the spectral coordinate of node u .

3.2 Spectral Perturbation Spectral perturbation analysis deals with the change of the graph spectra ( eigenvalues and eigenvector components ) when the graph is perturbed . For a symmetric n × n matrix A with a symmetric perturbation E , the matrix after perturbation can be written as eA = A + E . Let i be the i~i and ~xi denote the eigenvalue and eigenvector of eA . It th largest eigenvalue of A with its eigenvector xi . Similarly , has been shown that the perturbed eigenvector ~xi can be approximated by a linear function involving all original eigenvectors ( refer to Theorem V28 in [ 27] ) . We quote it as below . Lemma 1 . Let U = ( x1 ; : : : ; xi−1 ; xi+1 ; : : : ; xn ) , S = i Exj . The diag(1 ; : : : ; i−1 ; i+1 ; : : : ; n ) , and fiij = xT eigenvector ~xi ( i = 1;··· ; k ) can be approximated as :

3.3 Spectral Properties of Unsigned Graph with Approximate k block Community Structure In [ 19 ] , the authors conducted theoretical studies to demonstrate why node points in an unsigned graph with k communities exhibit the k orthogonal line pattern in the projected spectral subspace of the graph ’s adjacency matrix . They treated the observed graph as a k block diagonal network ( with k disconnected communities ) perturbed by a matrix consisting all cross community edges and applied matrix perturbation theory to study perturbation on the eigenvectors and spectral coordinates in the adjacency eigenspace . We quote their main results below thus we can compare and clearly show the differences from our theoretical results on signed networks . a graph with k disconnected communities C1;··· ; Ck of size n1 ; : : : ; nk respectively ( i ni = n ) , its adjacency matrix A can be written as a block wise diagonal matrix :

Proposition 1 . For a graph with k disconnected comparable communities as shown in 3 , spectral coordinates of all nodes locate on the k axes 1;··· ; k where i = ( 0 ; : : : ; 0 ; 1 ; 0 : : : ; 0 ) is the canonical basis and the i th entry of i is 1 . Specifically , for any node u ∈ Ci , its spectral coordinate has the form ffu = ( 0;··· ; 0 ; xiu ; 0;··· ; 0 ) :
( 4 )
The position of non zero xiu in 4 indicates the community that node u belongs to ; and the value of xiu indicates the weight or importance of node u within the community Ci and hence captures the magnitude of belongings .
The following result shows the approximation of the perturbed spectral coordinate ffu , which is determined by the original spectral coordinate of itself and that of its neighbors in other communities .

4 SPECTRAL ANALYSIS OF SIGNED GRAPHS In this section , we study the effect of positive and negative edges and prove clusterability of two types of signed networks . The key idea is to apply matrix perturbation and show the effect of positive and negative edges between two communities can cancel each other to certain extent so that the k communities still appear to be k orthogonal clusters in the spectral space spanned by the principle eigenvectors .
4.1 Type I : Graphs with Mixed Positive/Negative InterCommunity Edges Recall Type I signed networks have dense and positive inner community connections whereas whereas intercommunity connections are mixed with both a large number of positive and negative edges . Denote the adjacency matrix of a Type I signed graph as eA = A + E where A is as eigenvectors of eA ( conditions in Lemma 1 are not satisfied ) . shown in Equation 3 and E denotes the signed edges across communities . Because E is not sparse , we cannot apply Lemma 1 directly to get the approximation of the first few
Our following theoretical results show that communities are still distinguishable when the difference between the number of positive inter community edges and the number of negative inter community edges is small even though their sum is large . We further show that line pattern is lost when too many cross community edges are present . Nodes with no connection with other communities or with equal weight of positive and negative connection with other communities form a central line for the community and other nodes scatter around lines . Central lines for different communities are orthogonal to each other thus we observe k clusters orthogonal to each other . Corollary 1 . Denote the adjacency matrix of a signed graph as eA = A + E where A is as shown in Equation 3 and E denotes the signed edges across communities . If E can be decomposed into E = Er + Et satisfying : • Er contains similar number of positive and negative j Erxi ≈ 0 ; the condition in Lemma 1 ;
• Et contains mostly one kind of edges and Et satisfies we conclude that the leading k eigenvectors of eA can be edges so that xT approximated as

We show our detailed proof in Appendix . The key idea is to decompose E into a series of Es for s = 1;··· ; t−1 where each Es contains a very small number of mixed signed edges . According to Lemma 2 , all entries of xi are nonnegative . So the part of fiji decided by the positive edges can cancel with that decided by the negative edges . We j Esxi ≈ 0 . Hence we can apply Lemma 1 to get have xT the approximated eigenvectors iteratively over a series of small pertubations . ( ~x1;··· ; ~xk ) ≈ ( x1;··· ; xk)eR + E (

We call Er the balanced part and Et the unbalanced part ( of E . If E contains only the balanced part , ie , Et = 0 , we have ~fiji ≈ 0 so that ( ~x1;··· ; ~xk ) ≈ ( x1;··· ; xk ) + . This is a very special type of signed graph : Er with a large amount of signed edges added across the communities , the nodes scatter around axis while there is no rotation for all nodes in one community together as we see in the unsigned graph . On the other hand , if E contains only the unbalanced part , ie , Er = 0 , we have , which is of the same form with Equation 5 . When E contains both parts , Equation 8 has two more terms than Equation 5 . These two terms are related with the impact from the nodes’ direct neighbors and some neighbors 2 steps away because the balance and unbalance part of E . We notice so that the third term in Equation 8 is much smaller compared with the second term . The fourth flflfl EtErxi term is also small because ∥Er∥ and ∥eR− I∥ are small . They Proposition 3 .

If Et = 0 , we have ~fiji ≈ 0 so that ffu ≈ ( 0;··· ; 0 ; xiu ; 0;··· ; 0 ) + ( Er)u is the summation of impact of node u ’s neighbors in Ci through the balanced part Er . Though we assume that we have equally positive and negative edges between communities in Er , individual nodes could still have more positive inter community edges than negative ones or vice versa . When inter community connection is dense , many nodes have a large number of inter community edges that are not equally positive and negative and thus have large jump from the central line ( 0;··· ; 0 ; xiu ; 0;··· ; 0 ) . The line pattern is no longer kept .

When Er = 0 and Et satisfies the condition in Lemma 1 , the graph has very sparse inter community connection . The result is similar to that of unsigned graph . Line pattern is still kept . However , nodes can scatter on both side of the central line instead of just one side . With neither Er nor Et is zero , there are two extra terms in Equation 10 compared with Equation 6 in Theorem 1 . The two extra terms capture further derivation of the nodes from their central lines . We summarize our result below .
Proposition 4 . The spectral coordinates of eA form k approxi mately orthogonal clusters . For node u ∈ Ci with no connection with other communities or with similar numbers positive and negative edges with the same community , ffu lies close to ~ri . Other nodes scatter around ~ri .

4.2 Type II : Signed Graph with k Disputing Communities In disputing networks , negative connections exist mostly in between two different communities and the graph . Definition 1 . A k dispute graph represents a graph with k communities under two constraints . First , there are no links inside the communities . Second , nodes from different communities are densely connected with negative edges . The adjacency matrix Ap can be written in the following form with proper permutation of the nodes :

Our following results can naturally be applied to regular kpartite graphs where all nonzero entries in Ap are positive . Let |1| > ··· > |n| be the eigenvalues of Ap and zi be the corresponding eigenvectors . We similarly define spectral coordinates ffu as in Equation 12 .

Since there are only negative edges , the largest eigenvalue in magnitude is negative according to Perron Frobenius theorem [ 27 ] . The corresponding eigenvector has all the entries nonnegative . The challenge is to characterize the spectral patterns of k dispute graph .
Our idea is to construct a new block matrix Q by subtracting the first eigenpairs from the graph Ap . We find that Q has blocks with positive entries on the diagonal and the blocks with positive and negative entries off the diagonal , which fits with part of conditions in Corollary 1 . Orthogonalizing the first k eigenvectors of Q with the removed eigenvector , we can get the approximated eigenvectors of the graph with only negative relations and show it clusterable in the spectral space spanned by these eigenvectors .

A is the same with Equation 3 except for the entries relaxed to real nonnegative numbers . E contains both positive and negative real number entries . The proof of Corollary 1 does not require 0 1 entries so that we can apply it to Q . In order to satisfy the conditions of Corollary 1 , we need to properly decompose E into Er and Et .

Proposition 5 converts the clusterability problem of a k dispute graph Ap to whether Et is a perturbation small enough . When qij ’s are close to zeros , ∥Et∥ is also close to zero and Ap is thus clusterable . Notice |1| is the approximated global density and zT is the approximated ∥zCi inter community connection density between Ci and Cj . Small qij ’s means that the inter community connections have similar density . Q has the first k − 1 eigenvalues no ∥2 21 . The first k − 1 eigenvalues less than mini=1;··· ;k ∥zCi of Q are exactly the eigenvalues of Ap from the second in magnitude . Thus the first k eigenvalues of Ap in magnitude has the first one positive and the rest ones negative . Extract a row and we have the spectral coordinates for node u belonging to Ci .

Since T K is an orthogonal matrix , its rows are orthogonal to each other . Now we can conclude that a k dispute graph is expected to form k clusters that are approximately orthogonal to each other . zT Ci ∥zCi

If the connection between any communities are close , two estimations are close so that qij is small and Et is easy to satisfy the conditions . So for such a kind of k partite graph , we can have the simple approximation of eigenvectors and k orthogonal clusters very clear in their spectral space . Otherwise , the communities may not be clusterable .

4.3 Unified Adjacency Eigenspace based Clustering In this section , we present a graph partition algorithm , UniAdjCluster , which utilizes the clusterable pattern in the spectral space of the adjacency matrix .
As shown in Algorithm 1 , we calculate the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalues in magnitude(line 1 ) . If those eigenvalues are positive , it usually indicates that the graph has some communities either with higher density of positive edges inside them or higher density of negative edges outside them . If the largest one of those eigenvalues is positive while the others are negative , it usually indicates that the graph has k partite structure . We then project each spectral coordinate ffu to the unit sphere in the k dimensional subspace by normalizing ffu to its unit length ( line 3 ) . With the right value of k , we expect to observe that nodes from one community to form a cluster on the unit sphere . Hence there will be k well separated clusters on the unit sphere . We apply the k means clustering algorithm on the unit sphere to produce a partition of the graph ( line 4 ) .

We use the Davies Bouldin Index ( DBI ) [ 28 ] as statistics to determine the best fitting . DBI can be calculated by the following formula :
)
( k∑
1 k max i̸=j i=1 dCi + dCj d(Ci ; Cj ) where dCi is the average distance of all elements in Ci to its centroid and d(Ci ; Cj ) is the distance between two centroids for Ci and Cj . The low DBI indicates output clusters with low intra cluster distances and high inter cluster distances . When the graph contains k clear communities , we expect to have the DBI reach its minimum after applying k means in the k dimensional spectral space . Calculation of the eigenvectors of an n × n matrix takes in general a number of operations O(n3 ) , which is almost inapplicable for large networks . However , in our framework , we only need to calculate the first K eigenpairs . We can determine the appropriate K as examining the eigen gaps [ 27 ] . Furthermore , adjacency matrices in our context are usually sparse . The Arnoldi/Lanczos algorithm [ 29 ] generally needs O(n ) rather than O(n2 ) floating point operations at each iteration .
The algorithm is focused on the first level of community structure in the graph . In order to refine the clustering result , we can apply the algorithm once again on one of the communities to do further partition .

5 EVALUATION 5.1 Datasets We generate several synthetic graphs for the purpose of illustrating our theoretical results . In all synthetic graphs , we have 5 communities with the number of nodes 200 , 180 , 170 , 150 , and 140 . For Syn 1 to Syn 3 , the inner community edges of each community , Ci , are generated separately with a power law degree distribution with the parameter 2:3 , whereas the inter community edges are added with different numbers . Denote ratio of inter community edges over inner community edges between Ci and Cj as pij . Syn 1 has pij = 20 % while Syn 2 increases p45 to 80 % and keeps the others same as Syn 1 . Syn 3 has pij = 80 % . Note that Syn 1 and Syn 2 are the exactly same as in [ 19 ] where the orthogonal line property was illustrated .
Fig 2 . k dispute with different density
Syn 4 and Syn 5 are two signed graphs by flipping 20 % and 50 % of outer community edges in Syn 3 to negative . Syn 6 , Syn 7 , and Syn 8 are three ideal k dispute graphs by removing all the inner community edges and then randomly adding negative edges between two communities with probability 0:2 , 0:4 and 0:6 , respectively .
We further generate four perturbed k dispute graphs , Syn 9 to Syn 12 , based on Syn 6 . Syn 9 is generated by adding inner community edges with the same sign . It has
−1 , which means the ratio of inner community pij = ( 20 % ) edges over inter community edges is 20 % . In Syn 10 , we further add inner community edges in C4 and C5 . p45 is −1 for these two communities . In Syn 11 , all pij now ( 80 % ) −1 . are ( 80 % )
The three real datasets include Facebook [ 30 ] , Correlates of War(COW ) [ 31 ] , and Epinions [ 32 ] . The original Correlates of War [ 31 ] data set contains international relations such as alliance and dispute among different countries and areas over the period 1993 2001 . In this paper , we use the highest level of alliance , defense pact , and the two highest level of dispute , use of force and war , to construct a signed graph COW with 159 nodes , 1093 positive edges and 155 negative edges . Epinions is a consumers opinion site where the users have their block list of those authors whose reviews are usually inaccurate or not valuable . We specially extract the two way untrusted relation and get a subgraph Epinion with 2027 nodes and 2383 edges . We include the statistics of all datasets in Block 1 of Table 1 where “ n ” denotes the number of nodes and “ m(+=− ) ” denotes the numbers of positive/negative edges respectively1 .
We run our algorithm UniAdjCluster on both the synthetic data and real network datasets and show graph partition results in Block 2 of Table 1 where “ k ” denotes the number of output clusters , “ DBI ” is the Davies Bouldin Index , “ Angle ” is the average angle between centroids , and “ Q ” is the signed modularity [ 5 ] . The signed modularity extended the definition of modularity to signed graphs by giving penalty to absent positive edges inside communities and negative edge inside communities while reward to positive edges inside communities and absent negative edge inside communities . The high modularity indicates a stronger community structure that contains more positive inner community edges and more negative outer community edges . Similarly , we expect all the angles between centroids of the output ◦ clusters are close to 90 since spectral coordinates form k quasi orthogonal clusters in the determined k dimensional

( b ) z3 , z4 , z5 of Syn 10 spectral space . Those statistics can be used to evaluate the cluster orthogonality property of various graphs .
The algorithm , UniAdjCluster , chooses the value of k that incurs the minimum DBI for each network data set . For a network with a clear community structure , we expect that the DBI is small , the modularity is away from zero , ◦ and the average angle is close to 90 since there exist k quasi orthogonal clusters in the spectral space . We can see from Table 1 that the real networks all show relatively clear community structures with expected measures .
5.2 Orthogonality Property We use spectral scatter plots to check the orthogonality property in various networks . Our results match the observations shown in [ 19 ] that for Syn 1 there exist five orthogonal lines in the spectral space ; and for Syn 2 there exist only four orthogonal lines since where dense intercommunity edges are added to only C4 and C5 and there are actually four communities .
DBI is 0 for Syn 0 at k = 5 that indicates the communities are well separated . For Syn 1 where moderate intercommunity edges are added to Syn 0 , UniAdjCluster still finds DBI has minimum at k = 5 . We have much smaller modularity of Syn 1 compared with that of Syn 0 but the average angle between centroids in Syn 1 is still closed ◦ . For Syn 2 where dense inter community edges are to 90 added to only C4 and C5 , UniAdjCluster returns k = 4 other than 5 . Modularity and the average angle of Syn 2 turn out to be smaller than those in Syn 1 , which indicates a less clear structure in Syn 2 with more inter community edges added . In Syn 3 , we see that a large number of positive intercommunity edges make the communities merge together . When negative edges are introduced such that the innercommunity edges are approximately mixed , our theoretical results showed that we can still have a clear cluster separation even when the total number of inter community edges is large . For Syn 4 where only moderate inter community edges are negative , UniAdjCluster stops at k = 4 since DBI exceeds 1 at k = 5.For Syn 5 where nearly half intercommunity edges are negative , DBI has minimum value
◦ . at k = 5 and we see the average angle is almost 90 Modularity of Syn 5 is larger than that of Syn 4 , which indicates a clearer community structure and verifies our theoretical results .
Next we show cluster orthogonality property for kdispute graphs . We use spectral scatter plots to check the orthogonality property in various networks . Figures 1 shows spectral plot of Syn 6 . A 5 dispute graph expects to have five separate clusters in the spectral space spanned by the five eigenvector with largest eigenvalues in magnitude . If we look at the first three dimensions , two of the communities , C4 and C5 , do not look separable . However , if we look at the fourth and fifth dimensions , we can see they are clearly separated .
We plot DBI of Syn 6 to Syn 8 against the number of clusters in Figure 2 . We can see all these graphs with clear 5 partite structure have minimum of DBI at k = 5 . We also notice that with the increase of outer community connection , DBI decreases . The observation indicates that the denser the outer community connection is the more clear clusters are in the spectral space .
With moderate inner community edges added , Syn 9 does not show big difference compared with Syn 6 . With more edges added inside C4 and C5(Syn 10 ) , we observe that the two communities merge together in the spectral space spanned by the first five eigenvectors . Figure 3 shows the last three dimensions for Syn 9 and Syn 10 . When we increase more inner community edges to k dispute graphs , the cluster orthogonality property is lost . For example , we can no longer observe 5 communities in Syn 11 . But with only 30 % inner community edges flipped to negative , we again observe 5 exact same communities .
For all the real datasets , they have DBI higher than 05 For these graphs , we usually do not observe orthogonal line pattern . Instead we have separable clusters . Notice that all ◦ the average angles of the real world datasets are over 80 . Facebook is a nonnegative graph and its first k eigenvalues are all positive . For Epinion , our algorithm returns a local minimum of DBI at k = 3 . The first three eigenvalues are one positive and two negative . This is a typical 3 dispute graph .

Fig 4 . Correlates of War are 375 , 58 , and 49 respectively . The number of inter edges are 938 , 270 , and 658 . For COW , our algorithm UniAdjCluster gives DBI with a local minimum at k = 8 and outputs the 6th to 8th eigenvalues as negative . We discover not only 5 communities with dominate positive edges inside communities , but also 3 communities with dominate negative edges inside communities . This is an example of general signed graph as a summation of two types of signed graphs . The 3 communities are plotted in red , brown and yellow in Figure 4 as the last three in the legend .

5.3 Accuracy Comparison with Existing Methods In our experiment , we compare our algorithm UniAdjCluster with two algorithms for signed graphs . The accuracy is where ^Ci denotes the i th commudefined as nity produced by different algorithms . The first algorithm [ 6 ] extends NormalCut to signed graph by modifying the
|Ci∩ ^Ci| k i=1 n definition of degree matrix . The second algorithm [ 5 ] applies an extended definition of modularity and runs various clustering methods such as simulate annealing to maximize the modularity . We show results in Block 3 of Table 1 where “ SNCut ” denotes the normalized cut and “ RLFCD ” denotes the resolution limit free community detection algorithm . Note that we cannot report accuracy values for the three real datasets , Facebook , COW and Epinion since we do not know about their true node community relations and we did not report accuracy values for Syn 1 to Syn 3 since they are unsigned graphs .
For Type I signed network , Syn 4 and Syn 5 , our algorithm produces higher accuracy values than the other two algorithms as shown in Table 1 . For ideal k dispute graphs , Syn 6 to Syn 8 , all three algorithms achieve 100 % accuracy . When low inner community connections are added to kdispute graphs , eg , as shown for Syn 9 , we can still get a 100 % in accuracy . However , when moderate or large inner community connections are added , eg , as shown for Syn 10 and Syn 11 , we see decreased accuracy values . The quality of the partitioning produced by our algorithm UniAdjCluster is better than ( or comparable with ) that produced by the other two algorithms .
6 CONCLUSION
In this paper , we have conducted spectral analysis for analyzing community structures of complex signed networks and show how the negative edges affect distributions and patterns of node spectral coordinates in the spectral space . Specifically , we prove and demonstrate cluster orthogonality for two types of signed networks : graph with dense inter community mixed sign edges and graph with k dispute structure . We show why the line orthogonality pattern does not hold in the spectral space for these two types of networks . On the practical aspect , we have developed a clustering method to study signed networks and k dispute networks . We have demonstrated with both synthetic and real graphs that our approach can successfully analyze community structures of different network types and our algorithm outperforms existing clustering methods on signed networks in terms of accuracy .
In our future work , we plan to conduct spectral analysis of weighted graphs . Our theoretical results do not put restriction on the entries of A or E so we expect they are applicable to weighted graphs . However , the situation in weighted graphs could be more complicated . For weighted graphs , each edge represent not merely the connection but also with a weight . So the definition of communities is changed . We expect larger sum of weight values of the edges inside communities and much less sum of weight values of the edges outside communities . In Theorem 1 , fiji is related with sum of weight of the edges outside communities and eigenvalues are related with sum of weight of the edges inside communities . So the rotation of the lines in the spectral space is decided by their fraction . Individual edges with relative large weight values outside communities may cause relative large jump of some nodes . We also plan to conduct spectral analysis of directed graphs . Many realworld networks have directionality on the edges , making the adjacency matrix non symmetric . Spectral analysis of directed graphs often transforms the directed network to undirected using various symmetrization approaches or leverages the generalization of the Laplacian matrix for directed graphs [ 33 ] . We will study the adjacency eigenspace projection patterns for directed graphs based on the graph perturbation theory and develop spectral clustering based graph partition algorithms for directed graphs .

APPENDIX A PROOFS i
A.1 Proof of Corollary 1 Er can be decomposed into a series of Es for s = 1;··· ; t−1 where each Es contains very small number of edges and j Esxi ≈ 0 . We can apply Lemma 1 to get the approxixT j E1xi ≈ 0 , the approximated mated eigenvectors . Since xT ≈ xi + E1 eigenvectors for A + E1 are ~x(1 ) xi . Because the edges are not added inside the communities , the eigenvalues remain almost the same : ~i ≈ i + xT j E1xi = i . E2 has similar condition with E1 . Thus the approximated ≈ ≈ x(1 ) eigenvectors of A + E1 + E2 are ~x(2 ) xi . When ∥E1∥2 and ∥E2∥2 are already xi + E1+E2 very small compared with i and ∥E2E1∥2 ≤ ∥E1∥2∥E2∥2 , xi . 2 i So the last term is negligible . Then ~x(2 ) xi . We follow similar procedure and get the approximated eigenvectors of A + xi has values much smaller compared with E1+E2 ≈ xi + E1+E2 xi + E2E1 2 i i + E2 i

A.2 Proof of Proposition 4 smaller than |i−j| . So eRT eR ≈ I and ~ri ’s are approximate
Since Et satisfies the conditions in Lemma 1 , ~fiji is much ly orthogonal . There are two kinds of nodes that still stay on or close to ~ri . The first kind of nodes has no connection outside its own community . The second kind of nodes has similar weight of positive and negative edges so that Euxi ≈ 0 . These two kinds of nodes may not locate exactly on ~ri since the third and fourth terms in Equation 10 are not equal to 0 . Line pattern may be lost with a large amount of edges added across communities since the proportion of these two kinds of nodes among all the nodes are limited . We can only see most of the nodes scatter around ~ri ’s . However , since ~ri ’s are orthogonal , the communities appear to be k clusters that are orthogonal to each other and thus they are clusterable .
A.3 Proof of Proposition 5
Since Et defined in Equation 14 satisfies the conditions of Lemma 1 and xjErxi = 0 , we can thus follow the similar procedures as shown in the proof of Corollary 1 and have :
( ~x1;··· ; ~xk ) ≈ ( x1;··· ; xk)eR + E
(

; : : : ; xk k where i ’s are the eigenvalues of A . We will plug in later . Here we omit the last two terms in Equation 9 since they are usually much smaller .
Since the k dimensional subspace spanned by ~xi is approximately the one spanned by xi and z1 is of linear combination of xi , the subspace spanned by ( z1 ; ~x1;··· ; ~xk ) is almost the same with ( z1 ; ~x1;··· ; ~xk−1 ) . In order to get ~z2 ; :: : ; ~zk , we need othogonalize ~xi for i = 1;··· ; k− 1 with z1 .
By removing last column in eR and adding one column ) before the first column , we define T as Equation 16 so that
(
( z1 ; ~x1;··· ; ~xk−1 ) ≈ ( x1;··· ; xk)T + E

By Gram Schmidt process , we can find a K such that T K is an orthogonal matrix .

Since E contains nonzero values only in the off diagonal has 0 value on the entries where blocks , E T has almost 1 . So the second , third and forth terms in Equation 19 are close to 0 . It means that ( z1 ; ~x1;··· ; ~xk−1)K has approximately ) orthogonal columns that can be used as good approximation for eigenvectors of Ap . So xk−1 ( z1 ; ~z2;··· ; ~zk ) ≈ ( x1;··· ; xk)T K+E k−1 Plug in i = ∥zCi |1| , we have reached our conclusion . the subspace spanned by ( z1 ; ~x1;··· ; ~xk−1 ) has k − 1 positive eigenvalues with Ap . Gram Schmidt process does not change the subspace . So the approximated eigenvalues for ~zi ’s ( i ≥ 2 ) are positive . x1 1 ∥3 − ∥zCi 2 ) > 0 , i Ap ~xi = |1| ( ∥zCi
