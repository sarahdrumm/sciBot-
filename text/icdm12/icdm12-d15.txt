INTRODUCTION
( SCFDD ) by is to for crucial
The scarcity of potable water is one of the most critical challenges facing the world . The statistics shown in Nature 2010 [ 1 ] states that about 80 % of the world ’s population lives in short of potable water . Furthermore , according the California Department of Water Resources , without more water supplies by 2020 , the region will suffer a deficiency nearly as much as the total amount consumed today [ 2 ] . At the global level , the existing freshwater is only enough to extend out as much as 60 or 70 years [ 3 ] . Urban water consumption contributes to 50% 80 % of public water supply systems and 26 % of whole usage in the US[4 ] . establishing
Studies have shown that device level water usage information effective conservation strategies [ 5 7 ] . This paper specifically considers the task of disaggregating residential water consumption targeting for conservation . Consumption disaggregation the process of separating aggregated smart meter readings into the consumption of its devices , such as toilet , shower and washer .
Recently , water consumption disaggregation has become an important topic to explore solutions for water conservation . Most previous studies focus on sensing the open/close pressure waves of devices to identify the signatures for separation . These methods are capable of achieving more than 90 % in accuracy measure . However , they depend on high sample rate ( typically 1 kHz ) data sources to analyze individual device features . The widely deployed smart meters only produce low sample rate ( as low as 1/900 Hz ) readings to ensure reliable data transmission . It ’s critical to design an effective algorithm to disaggregate low sample rate aggregated data . refers to
The challenge is to cope with the issues caused by low sample rate data sources , since it ’s impossible to identify the open/close signatures of devices from the data at such a low resolution [ 8 , 9 ] . This inspires us to model new “ signatures ” for devices from low sample rate data . Through integrating the water usage cycles ( or duration ) with interval based consumption trend ( per interval is 15 min ) , we propose to use shape features as one “ signature ” for distinguishing devices . In addition , another “ signature ” is defined as the amplitude of activations , indicating the consumption of device . For instance , with respect to consumption , the “ signature ” of toilet is 1~5 gallons while that of shower is 6~30 gallons . We then integrate the inherent shape and activation features into Sparse Coding with Featured Discriminative Dictionary ( SCFDD ) to separate the whole home data into its components . The contributions of this paper are as follows :

• Extensive experiments illustrating the effectiveness of SCFDD : We demonstrated the effectiveness of SCFDD by comparing it with other models in both whole home and device level measures . for

A . Notations and Concepts denote aggregated water consumption over all devices as
Assume we are given ݀ different devices , such as toilet , shower , and washer . For each device ݅ൌͳǡǥǡ݀ , we have a water consumption matrix ܇௜אԹ்ൈ௠ , where ܶ is the number of intervals in one day , and ݉ is the number of days . The ݆th column of ܇௜ , denoted by ࢟௜௝ , is the ݆th day ’s water usage for device ݅ , where ݆ =1 , … , m . The κ th element of ࢟௜௝ , denoted by ݕ௜௝κ , κൌͳǡǥܶ , is the κth interval ’s water usage in the ݆th day for device ݅ . We ܇ഥؠσ ܇௜ௗ௜ . Thus , each column of ܇ഥ indicates one day ’s data , ܇ଵǡǤǤǤǡ܇ௗ .

Sparse coding for source separation [ 10 ] and energy disaggregation [ 11 ] is to learn device based dictionary , and then separate aggregated signals into individual devices . aggregated water consumption of all devices . In the training process , we have individual device consumption notion of sparseness is achieved by shaping the probability probability at zero . B . Discriminative Sparse Coding
Eq ( 1 )
We discuss the basic idea of discriminative sparse coding in energy disaggregation [ 11 ] , where the prior on activations of non negative sparse coding [ 13 ] is Laplace distribution . The complete data likelihood could be converted into the following optimization function [ 12 ] ,

The primary attempts for disaggregation tasks focus on power consumption disaggregation . Nonintrusive Appliance Load Monitoring ( NALM ) was proposed by Hart [ 15 ] for breaking apart residential power consumption , and he indicated that the distinct power consumption signatures of different electrical appliances could be depicted with Finite State Machines ( FSM ) . Recently , Kolter et al . proposed Discriminative Disaggregation Sparse Coding ( DDSC ) for separating low sample rate aggregated power readings [ 11 ] . However , the proposed method requires a large amount of training data for training purpose . An unsupervised framework for the disaggregation of low frequency power measurements [ 16 ] was proposed by integrating some additional features ( eg time of day ) into Factorial Hidden Markov Model ( FHMM ) .
With respect to water consumption disaggregation , Froehlich et al . designed pressure based sensors for water fixtures to identify the activity at individual water fixtures within a home [ 17 ] . But this method depends on high sample rate data . A HMM based approach was proposed in [ 18 ] to analyze human activities with low sample rate aggregated smart meter readings . However , this method analyses activities in one sequenced data , limiting its ability to parse parallel activities . incapable of analyzing
There is a lack of models designed for disaggregating low sample rate water consumption . Existing methods are mainly proposed for power consumption disaggregation , which are the features of aggregated smart meter readings collected at a low resolution . HMM based method analyses the activities with interval based consumption ; however , it has limited ability to estimate the consumption for devices . III . SPARSE CODING WITH FEATURED DISCRIMINATIVE
DICTIONARY
We begin by examining the shape features for low sample rate water consumption . Subsequently , we insepct activation features to characterize the consumption feature for devices . The signal disaggregation is finally performed with Maximum a Posteriori ( MAP ) estimation . A . Inherent Shape Features Discovery
Based on domain knowledge , it is suggested that the time duration and consumption trend are distinct across devices [ 19 ] . For example , time duration of toilet is around 1~3 minutes , while time duration of shower is around 3~20 minutes . Under the context of this paper , the sample of intervals . rate of smart meters is 1/900 HZ , indicating that per reading is 15 min , and there are 96 intervals in one day . We use span and consumption trend to depict shape features .
Definition 1 . ( Span ) For any device ݅ , the span of ݅ , denoted by ܵ௜ , is defined as the enumeration of all possible time duration of device ݅ measured as the number duration , 1 or 2 . So by Definition 1 , ܵൌሼͳǡʹሽ . Since ቄቂͲǤ͹ͲǤͺቃǡቂͳǤͲͲǤͷቃǡቂͲǤͷͳǤͲቃǡቂͲǤͺʹǤͷቃǡቂ͵ǤʹͳǤ͹ቃǡቂͲǤͺͲǤͺቃǡቂͳǤͲͳǤͲቃǡǥቅǡ water consumption is continuous , it ’s complex to define trend features . For instance , only with respect to 2 intervals , toilet might contain infinite combinations as long as the sum is in a certain range ( 1~5 gallons [ 19] ) , such as
Take toilet as an example , there are two possible time
Eq ( 3 )
2 over distributed where each vector shows one possible intervals toilet consumption ( for simplification , we only show the 2 of 96 intervals in one day ) . Actually , the infinite possibilities cause the problem to be intractable . Thus , it ’s critical to invent a new method for approximation . Inspecting data shown in Eq ( 3 ) , we could intuitively reach the pattern that there exists numerical relation ( larger than , equal , or less than ) between values in these two intervals . This indicates that the maximum number of consumption trend over ݖ intervals is ͵௭ሺ௭ିଵሻȀଶ , where ݖ is an integer larger than 0 . It grows exponentially with the number of intervals . To simplify this problem , we propose a novel method to approximate the trend of consumption through only considering first order relations ( see Definition 2 ) .
Definition 2 . ( First order Relation ) Given any time relation on this time series is defined as , series consisting ࣮ real values आଵǡǥǡआ࣮ , we first use आ୫୧୬ and आ௠௔௫ to respectively denote the minimum and maximum values of these ࣮ real values .

For example , all data in Eq ( 3 ) are approximated as ,
Eq ( 4 ) certainly acceptable .
Based on Eq ( 4 ) , we can convert all vectors in Eq ( 3 )
Definition 3 . ( Consumption Mapping ) Given any device where the first vector in Eq ( 5 ) indicates that the first element is less than the second element ; the second vector indicates the first element is larger than the second element ; and the last vector indicates these two elements are the same . general water consumption devices , such as toilet , shower , and washer , the maximum interval based duration is 7 ( 1 hour and 45 minutes ) . This indicates that the most to Eq ( 5 ) . For a specific device ݅ , we have significantly reduced the complexity from infinity ( λ ) to ʹௌ೔ࣼെͳ , where ܵ௜ࣼ is the ࣼth element in ܵ௜ . Practically , considering complex ordering combination is ʹ଻െͳൌͳʹ͹ , which is ݅ and its corresponding span ܵ௜ .

Thus , in Definition 3 , we only consider ࢟௜௝ ’s non zero values . Here we use ग௜ to denote the consumption mapping results of ܇௜ . Definition 4 . ( Shape Features ) Given ग௜ , the shape features of device ݅ denoted by झ௜ is the set of unique elements in ग௜ , ݅ൌͳǡǥǡ݀ . combination . Then consumption mapping is the process to
If there is water consumption , it is shown as the non
The shape features of Eq ( 3 ) are shown in Eq ( 5 ) . However , each element in the consumption mapping results is associated with one element in the time series set . For instance , the consumption mapping results of Eq ( 3 ) is :

The proposed shape features effectively capture time duration and consumption trend . Based on prior knowledge [ 19 ] , we can define the span for general devices . Taking shower as an example , time duration 3~20 minutes is able to capture more than 95 % situations . Thus ,

We examine another important discriminative feature relating to the consumption of devices . For example , average water usage of one toilet is about 2.0 gallons , while that of one shower is about 17.8 gallons [ 19 ] .
Based on the fact that water consumption of individual device basically remain the same value over time [ 20 ] , the non zero activations will also remain the same .

To induce the model to prefer the activation fit for the learned gamma distribution , we iteratively remove the abnormal activation values through statistical hypothesis testing .
We detect outliers in gamma distribution through applying the hypothesis testing algorithm proposed by Zerbet and Nikulin [ 21 ] . Consequently , we set the spot activations to be zero , and then continue iterating until no abnormal values are detected . The process to learn

( 9 )
In this section , we evaluate the performance of the proposed methods based on real world scenarios . A . Experiment Setup
1 ) Datasets : A large scale dataset containing nearly one million individual water use “ events ” was collected by Aquacraft from 1,188 residents in 12 study sites ( such as Boulder , Colorado and Lompoc , California ) [ 22 ] . Water consumption for various end uses was measured using compact data loggers and a PC based flow trace analysis software .
2 ) Benchmark Methods : We have included the most recent machine learning methodologies for low sample rate data disaggregation : discriminative sparse coding for energy disaggregation and FHMM based methods for energy disaggregation . For the fitness purpose , we compared the proposed methods with five existing related models : discriminative disaggregation sparse coding ( DDSC ) , discriminative disaggregation sparse coding with total consumption priors ( DDSC + TCP ) , discriminative disaggregation sparse coding with group lasso ( DDSC + GL ) , discriminative disaggregation sparse coding with total consumption priors and group lasso ( DDSC + TCP + GL ) , and FHMM . We focused on analyzing three main devices’ water consumption : toilet , shower and washer .
3 ) Evaluation Metrics for Disaggregation Several existing evaluation metrics are applied to evaluate the disaggregation performance . First , we used normalize disaggregation error [ 23 ] and accuracy [ 11 ] to show the

B . Performance Evaluation and Comparison
To demonstrate the effectiveness of SCFDD , we compare it with five benchmark methods .
TABLE I shows the disaggregation performance obtained by many prediction methods . SCFDD performed nearly as well or better than all other methods . DDSC and FHMM almost have the same performance . Furthermore , SCFDD was capable of classifying real world water usage at device level with more than 65 % F measures for toilet , shower , and 30 % for washer . Specifically , for shower and washer , the GL extension to DDSC achieved a very poor performance for testing set . This is caused by the fact that GL distorts the model for fitting the testing data .

There is a large gap between training set performance and the testing set performance for washer with respect to precision , recall and F measure . This is caused by the bias values in the data . Since the frequency of washer is much lower than that of toilet or shower , it ’s much easier to cause the decrease of performance for washer than the others .

DDSC + TCP could achieve a higher accuracy than all others for both training and testing set , due to the consideration of forcing the total estimated amount data to be as close as the true aggregated data . SCFDD could achieve near zero NDE . This is caused by the fact that SCFDD is capable of capturing both shape and amplitude features for correctly estimating the consumption of individual devices .
V . CONCLUSION
Water consumption disaggregation is a domain where advances in data mining and machine learning could have a significant impact on . In this paper , we provide a concrete solution to the disaggregation of low sample rate smart meter readings . We extract the inherent shape and activation features to discriminatively characterize devices . SCFDD is constructed by incorporating the discovered features into sparse coding for disaggregation task . We apply Gamma distribution to drive the activations of basis to fit the amplitude of consumption . The MAP estimator is employed to predict the consumption of devices . Finally , extensive experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of SCFDD by comparing it with several benchmark methods .
