ABSTRACT In highly populated urban zones , it is common to notice headway deviations ( HD ) between pairs of buses . When these events occur in a bus stop , they often cause bus bunching ( BB ) in the following bus stops . Several proposals have been suggested to mitigate this problem . In this paper , we propose to find BBS ( Bunching Black Spots ) – sequences of bus stops where systematic HD events cause the formation of BB . We run a sequence mining algorithm , named PrefixSpan , to find interesting events available in time series . We prove that we can accurately model the BB trip usual pattern like a frequent sequence mining problem . The subsequences proved to be a promising way of identify the route’ schedule points to adjust in order to mitigate such events .

Introduction
In highly populated urban zones , it is well known that there is some schedule instability , especially in highly frequent routes ( 10 minutes or less ) [ 1 5 ] . In this kind of routes it is more important the headway ( time separation between vehicle arrivals or departures ) regularity than the fulfillment of the arrival time at the bus stops [ 4 ] . Due to this high frequency , this kind of situations may force a bus platoon running over the same route . In fact , a small delay of a bus provokes the raising of the number of passengers in the next stop . This number increases the dwell time ( time period where the bus is stopped at a bus stop ) and obviously also increases the bus ’s delay . On the other hand , the next bus will have fewer passengers , shorter dwell times with

Problem Overview
Nowadays , the road public transportation ( PT ) companies face a huge competition of other companies or even of other transportation means like the trains , the light trams or the private ones . The service reliability is a fundamental metric to win this race [ 12 ] : if a passenger knows that a bus of a selected company will arrive certainly on the schedule on his bus stop , he will probably pick it often . The reverse effect is also demonstrated and a BB event forming a visual bus pair is a strong bad reliability signal to the passengers’ perception of the service quality , which can lead to important profit losses [ 9 , 13 ] . This tendency to form platoons is usual for urban vehicles ( specially the PT ones ) and arises for the specific and complex characteristics of transit service perturbations . Those are mainly related with changes in three key factors [ 8 ] : the dwell time and the loading time ( highly correlated ) and the non casual passenger arriving ( passengers that , for an unexpected reason – like a soccer match or a local holiday try to board in a specific bus stop distinct from the usual one ) . However , the study of these changes impact on the service reliability is not in our current scope . Our goal is to find persistent and frequent headway irregularities which will probably provoke , in a short time horizon , a BB event .
There are two distinct approaches found in the literature to handle the BB events : the first one defines the bunching problem as a secondary effect of a traffic system malfunction like a traffic/logistic problem ( signal priority handling , adaptation of bus stops/hubs logistics to the needs , adjustments of the bus routes to the passengers demand , etc ) The second one defines the BB problem like a main one that must be treated and solved per se ( adjust the timetables and the schedule plans to improve schedules’ reliability or set live actions to the irregular bus pairs , for instance ) .
In this work , we are just focused on the second approach which related work , motivation and scope we present along this section .
2.1 Related Work
There are two distinct approaches to mitigate BB : ( 1 ) the PT planning one , where they try to adjust the schedule plans somehow and the control one , where the BB is avoided by actions suggested live by the controllers and ( 2 ) the real time approaches , which use
80
L . Moreira Matias et al . streaming data to evaluate the network and to choose some actions to keep the system stable . To do so , it is suggested one or more actions to the irregular ( ie schedule behind or ahead ) buses . There are four types of actions that can be proposed to avoid BB in real time : the change in bus holding time , the stop skipping , the preplanning deadheading ( the scheduling of some vehicles to run empty through a number of stations at the beginning or the end of their routes ) and the change in the bus cruise speed .
We can split the existing experimental setups to test and evaluate such approaches in two big groups : the first one uses simulation models and the newer one ’s uses AVL historical data to test their approaches . A brief state of art on both is presented below .
Simulation Models
Newell et . al presented one of the first known models to reduce BB [ 14 ] : an optimization framework to control the headway deviation effects . Basically , it consists in the simulation of two buses and one control point . The simulation was run assuming ideal conditions and it consists in the introduction of delay in one of the buses using stochastic variables . The simulation tested control metrics to force the headway to remain stable .
Public transportation companies use slack times in the building of their schedule plans in order to avoid that delays in a given trip force delays in the departure of the next trip . This is a common practice in order to guarantee passengers’ satisfaction by increasing schedules reliability . An important definition is presented by Zhao et al . in [ 11 ] : “ an optimal slack time will correspond to the best schedule plan possible . This plan should avoid BB situations ” . They present a method to obtain the optimal slack times for a given number of vehicles on highly frequent routes .
One of the first probabilistic model to predict BB [ 15 ] defines a distribution along a given line to evaluate the tendency of buses to form pairs as they progress down their route . Other works present models like this one . One of them [ 16 ] uses the Monte Carlo theorem to introduce stochastic variations to the traffic conditions , namely , the bus speed between stops . Usually these works consider classical variables of public transportation planning like the bus speed between bus stops , passengers boarding time , headway , among others , to suggest forced actions to detect BB in a simulation . These two works suggest one or two types of forced actions to maintain stability in the simulation after the launch of a BB trigger .
Gershenson et . al . presented a model adapted from a metro like system and implemented a multi agent simulation [ 1 ] . To achieve stability , they implemented adaptive strategies where the parameters are decided by the system itself , depending on the passenger density . As a result , the system puts a restriction to the vehicle holding time ( it sets a maximum dwell time ) , negotiating this value for each bus stop with the other vehicles .
Real Data ( AVL ) Models
The introduction of AVL systems changed the research point of view on bus bunching , in the last ten years , from planning to control . There are several techniques

81 in PT to improve the schedule plans on time tables based on AVL data . An useful review on those is presented by Peter Furth in [ 17 ] .
C . Daganzo presents a dynamic holding time formulae based on real time AVL data in order to adaptively compensate the headway instability introduced in the system [ 2 ] .
There are as well bus cruising speed approaches . In [ 3 ] it is presented a model allowing the buses to negotiate an ideal cruising speed to avoid potential BB situations .
Headway Irregularities on AVL Based Models
The relations between the irregularities in the headway sequences and the BB events have been recently explored : in [ 8 ] is presented a study identifying the headway distributions representing service perturbations based on probability density functions ( pdf ) This study was done using a stochastic simulation model for a one way transit line accounting several characteristics like the dwell time or the arrivals during the dwell time ( which values for each bus stops were calculated using the pre calculated pdf ) Despite their useful conclusions , their model had two main disadvantages : 1 ) is not based in real AVL data and 2 ) it does not present a probability density function to represent the pattern of consecutive headways irregularities . We do believe that this specific issue can be rather addressed mining frequent sequences on real AVL data , as we present here .
2.2 Motivation and Scope
We can define the headway irregularities as events that occur in a bus stop of a given trip . Those events consist in a large variation ( 1 for positive or 1 for negative ) on the headway : Headway Deviation events ( HD ) .
These are usually correlated in a snowball effect that may occur ( or not ) in a given ( straight or spaced ) sequence of bus stops . Despite the analysis of the state of art work on the mitigation of BB events , the authors found no work on systematizing real HD patterns that seem to be in the genesis of a BB event .
An unreliable timetable is one of the main causes of many HD events . Usually , a timetable is defined using schedule points : stops for which there is an arriving or departing time defined . One of the most well known PT planning ways to mitigate HD events is to add/reduce slack time in these defined timestamps to increase schedule plan overall reliability . However , only a small percentage of the bus stops served by a given timetable are used as schedule points . This is exemplified in the upper part of Fig 2 ( the reader can obtain further details on schedule plan building in chapter 1 from [ 18] ) . Usually , PT planners easily identify which lines present more HD and BB events . However , three questions still remain open :
1 ) Which should be the schedule points affected ? 2 ) Which action ( increase/decrease slack time ) should be applied to these schedule points in order to reduce the occurrence probability of BB events ?

3 ) Which day period ds should have the timestamps in these schedule po ints changed ?

3.1 Mining Time Series Sequences
There is a wide range of algorithms that can explore sequential data efficiently . To the best of our knowledge , Agrawal and Srikant introduced the sequential data mining problem in [ 19 ] . Let I = {i1 , i2 , , in} be a set of items and e an event such that e ( cid:1603 ) I . A sequence is an ordered list of events e1e2…em where each ei ( cid:1603 ) I . subsequence of β if there exists integers 1 ≤ j1 < j2< … <jr ≤ s such that a1 ( cid:1603 ) bj1 , a2 ( cid:1603 ) bj2 , … ,ar ( cid:1603)bjr . A sequence database is a set of tuples ( sid , α ) where sid is the
Given two sequences α=a1a2…ar and β=b1 b2 … . bs , sequence α is called a sequence identification and α is a sequence . The count of a sequence α in D , denoted count(α , D ) , is the number of sequences in D containing the α subsequence .
The support of a sequence α is the ratio between count(α , D ) and the number of sequences in D . We denote sequence support as support(α , D ) . Given a sequence database D and a minimum support value λ , the problem of sequence mining is to find all subsequences in D having a support value equal or higher than the λ value . Each one of the obtained sequences is also known as a frequent sequence .
In [ 20 ] the GSP algorithm , an algorithm that generalizes the original sequential pattern mining problem , is introduced . The search procedure of this algorithm is inspired by the well known APRIORI algorithm [ 21 ] . GSP uses a candidategeneration strategy to find all frequent sequences , and uses a lattice to generate all candidate sequences . We observe that GSP has limitations when dealing with large datasets because candidate generation may require multiple database queries .
Several approaches have been proposed to address the above mentioned issue . One of the most interesting and efficient proposals is PrefixSpan algorithm [ 22 ] . This algorithm makes use of pattern growth strategies to efficiently find the complete set of frequent sequences . The algorithm starts by finding all frequent items ( length one sequences ) . Then , for each one of these frequent items ( the prefix ) PrefixSpan partitions the current database into prefix projections . Each projection database contains all the sequences with the given prefix . This procedure runs recursively until all frequent sequences are found .
In this work we run PrefixSpan algorithm to solve our problem due to its popularity and efficiency .
3.2 Methodology
Firstly we constructed headway sequences based in the AVL historic data for every bus pairs in a given route . Then we identified the headway profiles where BB events occurred based on the bus service reliability metrics presented in [ 23 ] and we extracted HD sequences from them . route through bus stops running with a frequency ( cid:1858 ) ( (cid:1858)1/(cid:1876) ) . We identify a BB if there exists a ( cid:1876 ) satisfying the inequality ( cid:1876)(0.25(cid:1499)1/(cid:1858 ) ) for at least one ( cid:1861 ) ( cid:1488 ) ( cid:4668)1,…,(cid:4669 ) . An example of this analysis is shown in Fig 3 and in Fig 4 , where we

In the second study , we analyzed whether the BBS identified were coherent in both peak hours . In route B1 , the BS2_B1 is a BBS for both peak hours .
BS2_A1 and BS2_A2 are also persistent BBS in both peak hours . Those two bus stops correspond to an important bus interface ( Sá da Bandeira ) in the city and to a University Campus ( Asprela ) , respectively . This happens because both routes maintain a high frequency and a large number of passengers during the day , being always busy . In our opinion , the short lengths of the frequent subsequences mined ( 1 and 2 ) are not relevant compared with the relevance of the identified patterns . Those lengths will always depend on the routes analyzed , so they can be larger when applied to other datasets . The achieved patterns demonstrate that the BB patterns can be modeled like a frequent sequence mining problem . The results achieved demonstrate the utility of our framework to identify the exact schedule points to change in the timetables .

Conclusions and Future Work
In public transportation planning , it is crucial to maintain the passengers’ satisfaction as high as possible . A good way to do so is to prevent the phenomenon known as Bus Bunching .
There are two main approaches to handle this problem : the PT planning one , anticipating and identifying the origin of the problem , and a real time one , which tries to reduce the problem online ( during the network function ) .
Our approach is a contribution to solve the PT planning problem : this framework can help to identify patterns of bus events from historical data to discover the schedule points to be adjusted in the timetables .
In this paper , we presented a methodology to identify BB events that use headway deviations from AVL trips data . We ran a sequence mining algorithm , the PrefixSpan , to explore such data .
The results are promising . We clearly demonstrated the existence of relevant patterns in the HD events of the travels with bunching . There were some bus stops sequences along the routes identified as BBS Bunching Black Spots , forming regions within the schedule points that should be adjusted . We want to highlight the following findings :
• The high correlation between HD in distinct bus stops – one event in a given bus stop provoke an event on another one with a regularity sustained by a reasonable support and confidence ;
• The detection of BBS in the beginning of the routes demonstrated that HD that occurs in the beginning of the trips can have a higher impact into the occurrence of BB compared with events occurred in bus stops further .
The main contributions of this work are : 1 ) to model the BB trip usual pattern like a frequent sequence mining problem ; 2 ) to provide the operator the possibility to mitigate the BB in a given line by adjusting the timetables , instead of suggesting forced actions that can decrease schedule reliability and , consequently , reduce passengers’ satisfaction .

The identified patterns are no more than alerts that suggest a systematic cause for the BB in the studied routes . This information can be used to improve the schedule . The goal is not to eliminate those events but just to mitigate them . Our future work consists in forecasting BB in a data stream environment based on AVL data . By using this approach , the BSS will be identified online as the data arrive in a continuous manner [ 24 ] . This possibility will allow the use of control actions to avoid BB events that can occur even when the timetables are well adjusted , in order to prevent the majority of the potential BB occurrences .
