Abstract—Recently , fiber segmentation has become an emerging technique in neuroscience . Grouping fiber tracts into anatomical meaningful bundles allows to study the structure of the brain and to investigate onset and progression of neurodegenerative and mental diseases . In this paper , we propose a novel technique for fiber tracts based on shape similarity and connection similarity . For shape similarity , we propose some new techniques adapted from existing similarity measures for trajectory data . We also propose a new technique called Warped Longest Common Subsequence ( WLCS ) for which we additionally developed a lower bounding distance function to speed up the segmentation process . Our segmentation is based on an outlier robust density based clustering algorithm . Extensive experiments on diffusion tensor images demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our technique .

I . INTRODUCTION
Over the past decades , Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DTI ) has become an important tool for quantification and comparison of white matter structures of the human brain in vivo [ 1 ] . By following the major direction of the underlying diffusion tensor field , the neural fiber tracts are constructed as a set of streamlines via tractography techniques [ 2 ] . Fiber tractography thus provides valuable insights in the internal structure of the white matter , which is very useful in surgical planning and in studies of various diseases such as Alzheimer , Parkinson and Schizophrenia . The tractography process produces a large number of fibers ( usually from 103 to 106 fibers ) , which makes the analysis of the white matter structures a difficult task . Therefore , various techniques are proposed to segment fibers into meaningful anatomical structures for quantification and comparison between individuals . Catani et al . [ 3 ] used a technique called virtual dissection to interactively select fibers passing through some manually defined regions of interests ( ROIs ) . Though this technique is highly flexible , it is very time consuming due to a large amount of complex fiber structures . Moreover , the results may be biased by subjective opinions of experts . Therefore , automatic fiber clustering algorithms [ 4]–[6 ] which require no user interaction and thus exclude undesirable bias have recently gained considerable attention .
Most automatic techniques for segmenting fibers are based on geometric properties of fibers . Two fibers are usually grouped into a bundle if they are separated by a small distance , have comparable length and have similar shape [ 5 ] . However , these criteria might be insufficient , since two fibers with different shapes can be grouped into a bundle if they start and end at the same region [ 6 ] . Moreover , the white matter tracts contain many spurious and noisy fibers which make the similarity measure and segmentation nontrivial problems . So , fiber segmentation remains an area of active research [ 4]–[7 ] , etc .
The most successful techniques use point to point distance as a basis for measuring similarity [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 8 ] . However , these techniques are sensitive to noise due to their point to point distance mechanism . Their effectiveness is also limited when detecting fibers with similar shapes due to the complexity of fiber structure . They also ignore the contribution of the start and end points of fibers which actually plays an important role in the segmentation [ 3 ] . Moreover , their quadratic time complexity makes them hard to deal with large fiber datasets .
In this paper , we investigate the problem of efficient and effective segmentation of the white matter fiber tracts . Our major contributions are :
1 ) We introduce a novel and robust similarity model called SIM for fiber segmentation by combining both shape similarity and connection similarity of fibers . Such an approach provides a robust and flexible way to deal with the complexity of white matter structures . 2 ) We introduce a new view on the shape similarity of fibers using a so called fiber envelope . Based on this scheme , some new shape similarity techniques are proposed by adapting various existing similarity techniques for trajectory data such as Longest Common Subsequence ( LCS ) and Edit Distance on Real sequence ( EDR ) [ 9 ] .
3 ) We propose a new technique called Warped Longest Common Subsequence technique ( WLCS ) . WLCS is more accurate and more robust to noise and local time shifting within fibers than other similarity measures . A lower bounding distance for WLCS is also proposed to speed up the comparison .
4 ) Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms and provide a closer view on their characteristics .

The rest of the paper is organized as follows . In Section II , we introduce new techniques to measure the similarity among fibers . Section III presents the segmentation algorithm . Section IV contains an extensive experimental evaluation . Section V discusses related work and Section VI concludes the paper .
II . FIBER SIMILARITY MEASURE
After tractography , fibers are extracted from DTI images and represented as a set of streamlines in 3D space .
A . Shape similarity of two fibers
To measure the shape similarity between two fibers A and B , we build an envelope around A ( Env(A) ) , and then compare it with B . If B is inside Env(A ) , they have similar shape . Such comparison provides a new view on the shape similarity , which differs from the previous approaches referred as distance based techniques [ 4 ] . Considering Figure 1 , by distance based mechanism , we cannot know whether the shape of fiber B or C is more similar to A , because Dist(A , B ) ≈ Dist(A , C ) . However , the envelope scheme successfully discovers that the shape of C is more similar to A than to B , because a large part of C lies inside Env(A ) .

Point to point distance

Envelope(A )
Figure 1 . By distance based techniques , both B and C are similar to A . By envelope based techniques , C is more similar to A than to B .
Assume that we have two fibers A = ( a1 , . . . , an ) and
B = ( b1 , . . . , bm ) . And let Ai be the first i points of A .
Definition 1 : Given a predefined similarity threshold , two fibers A and B are close to each other at position i and j respectively ( denoted as ai ∼ bj ) iff |ai(x ) − bj(x)| ≤ ∧ |ai(y ) − bj(y)| ≤ ∧ |ai(z ) − bj(z)| ≤ .
We exploit the envelope scheme for adapting existing similarity measures for trajectories such as LCS [ 10 ] or EDR [ 9 ] to fibers . Table I shows the definitions of LCS and EDR adapted for the shape similarity of fibers together with the existing techniques HDD , MCP [ 4 ] and DTW [ 8 ] . The parameter subcost of EDR equals 1 if ai ∼ bj and 0 otherwise . All similarity measures have O(n2 ) complexity . Since LCS and EDR only allow one to one matching mechanism , the measure is coarse . Thus , they do not distinguish fibers with similar common subsequences , although they belong to different bundles . They also perform poorly for fibers consisting of few points or of different lengths . To enhance the accuracy , one to many matching mechanism like DTW [ 10 ] should be employed . A similar idea can be found in music retrieval community where Guo et al . [ 11 ] proposed the Time Warped Longest Common Subsequence ( T WLCS ) technique to efficiently deal with problems like variations in speed and inaccuracies in the rhythm . We extend this scheme to deal with 3D fiber trajectories .
Definition 2 : Given a time constraint δ and a similarity threshold , the warped longest common subsequence of two fibers A and B , denoted as wlcsδ , ( An , Bm ) ( or wlcsδ , ( A , B ) in short ) , is defined as follows : if A or B is empty
0 1 + max(wlcsδ , ( An−1 , Bm−1 ) , wlcsδ , ( An , Bm ) =
⎧⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨ ⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩ wlcsδ , ( An , Bm−1 ) , wlcsδ , ( An−1 , Bm ) ) if an ∼ bm ∧ |n − m| ≤ δ max(wlcsδ , ( An−1 , Bm ) , wlcsδ , ( An , Bm−1 ) ) otherwise where it is only necessary to compare time points n and m of two sequences with |m − n| ≤ δ in order to produce meaningful results .
WLCS can also be calculated by using dynamic programming approach [ 10 ] to construct a cumulative cost matrix Mn×m , where the value of Mi,j can be calculated by the values of its adjacent cells . The time complexity is thus O(δ(n + m) ) . Figure 2 illustrates the calculation of WLCS for two fibers A and B in 1D . One point in fiber A can be matched with many points in fiber B and vice versa . The warping path , which is defined as a sequence of matrix cells Mi,j , in which the points at position i of A and j of B match , is monotonically spaced in time but some parts of A and B may remain unmatched .

Figure 2 . The comparison of two fibers A and B by WLCS model in 1D with time constraint δ and similarity threshold . For each point ai in fiber A , every point bj in fiber B ( with j in [ i − δ , i + δ ] ) which lies inside the circle of ai can be matched with ai .
Definition 3 : Given a time constrain δ and a similarity threshold , the similarity between two fibers A and B is defined as follows :
W LCSδ , ( A , B ) = 1 − wlcsδ , ( A , B ) n + m − 1
B . Lower bounding distance for WLCS
We propose a lower bounding distance to speed up the comparison of WLCS . We assume wlog that fiber A is longer than fiber B . The lower bounding distance of W LCSδ , ( A , B ) can be calculated by using the Minimum Bounding Envelope of A ( M BEδ , ( A ) ) [ 10 ] . For clarity , we also assume that A and B are now 1D fibers . However , the notion of the M BEδ , can be easily extended to 3D .

1 if bi is in the envelope of A 0 otherwise n i=1
Lemma 1 : Assume that A is longer than B , we have lcs(M BEδ , ( A ) , B ) + n − 1 ≥ wlcsδ , ( A , B ) . Proof : Let x be the number of points of B which lie outside the MBE of A . For any point bk ∈ B which lies outside MBE of A , assume that bi and bj are the closest front and rear points of bk which lie inside MBE of A . Also , ai . and aj . are matched points of bi and bj under WLCS respectively . There always exists a way to add a pair . to the warping path P which ( bk , ak . ) where i does not violate the monotony property . Since the full length warping path is bounded by n + m − 1 , we have : ⇒ wlcsδ , ( A , B ) ≤ lcs(M BEδ , ( A ) , B ) + n − 1 .

Definition 5 : Given two fibers A and B with the start points pA , pB and the end points qA , qB . The connection similarity between them is defined as follows :
Conn(A , B ) = )pA − pB ) + )qA − qB )
The connection similarity measures how close the two fibers start and end . Thus it plays an important role to distinguish fiber bundles . Many techniques rely only on this scheme to segment fibers either manually [ 3 ] or automatically [ 6 ] . D . Unified fiber similarity measure
Definition 6 : The similarity between two fibers A and B is defined as a weighted sum of their shape and connection similarities . Simδ , ,α(A , B ) = α·Shapeδ , ( A , B)+(1−α)·Conn(A , B )
7951016 where α ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] is used to control the balance between the shape and connection similarities .
Simδ , ,α(A , B ) unifies both important aspects : anatomical structure similarity and connectivity similarity of fiber bundles . As a result , it provides a flexible way to enhance the effectiveness of fiber similarity measure . E . Other important characteristics of fiber similarity
Due to the process of DTI tractography , the fibers may contain noise , which affects the similarity measure between them [ 3 ] . While DTW , HDD and MCP are sensitive to noise , LCS are EDR are less affected [ 10 ] . Since WLCS has the same threshold based scheme with LCS and EDR , it is also more robust to noise than distance based techniques .
For DTW , LCS , EDR and WLCS , the similarity between A and B depends on the orders of points in A and B . To overcome this problem , we use 2 phases approach which involves reverse of A ( Rev(A ) ) as follows : Sim2δ , ,α(A , B ) = min(Simδ , ,α(A , B ) , Simδ , ,α(Rev(A ) , B ) )
Figure 3 ( a ) shows the result of the clustering using the 1phase approach . Many fibers are not correctly grouped due to the direction problem . Figure 3 ( b ) shows perfect clustering result ( exactly the same as gold standard ) if we use the 2phases approach . In the rest of this paper , we always use the 2 phases approach for DTW , LCS , ERD and WLCS .

III . FIBER SEGMENTATION
To segment fibers into bundles , many clustering algorithms are used such as such as EM clustering , spectral clustering [ 6 ] , hierarchical clustering [ 7 ] and density based clustering [ 8 ] , [ 12 ] .
Since fiber datasets contain many imperfect or spurious fibers , fiber clustering algorithms should be able to ignore them . Moreover , they should be able to detect bundles with arbitrary shapes . Therefore , the density based clustering algorithm DBSCAN [ 13 ] is a good choice . Also , in contrast to other clustering techniques such as spectral clustering [ 6 ] or EM , DBSCAN does not require the number of clusters to be specified as an input parameter . DBSCAN is based on the idea that each core point of a cluster has to contain at least minpts points within its eps neighborhood .

To compare the clustering results with the gold standards , we use 3 different cluster evaluation methods : Dom [ 14 ] , NMI [ 15 ] and AMI [ 15 ] . However , we only show the NMI for clarity , since the results of AMI are the same with NMI . The result of NMI is in [ 0,1 ] , with 0 means that the clustering result is independent of the gold standard and 1 means that the clustering result is the same as the gold standard .
For parameter minpts and eps of DBSCAN , we fix the parameter minpts = 5 as suggested in [ 13 ] . For eps , we explore the search space from the minimum value 0.01 to 1.0 with search step 0.01 to ensure to find a suitable parametrization . For DTW , LCS , EDR and WLCS , we try various combinations of δ ( up to 100 ) and ( between 0.01 to 2.0 ) and report the best results .

Figure 4 . Effectiveness of different similarity measure techniques based on the range of eps . WLCS is more robust and can distinguish bundles better than other techniques .
Figure 5 shows clustering results on data set ( DS0 ) which contains 500 fibers belonging to 5 bundles namely Arcuate , Cingulum , Fornix , Inferior and Superior and 5 noisy fibers from other bundles . Only WLCS ( δ = 75 , = 0.1 , eps = 0.24 ) produces the gold standard exactly , while HDD ( eps = 0.26 ) ( ignored for clarity ) and MCP ( eps = 0.06 ) result in 6 clusters . DTW ( σ = ∞ , eps = 0.11 ) , LCS ( σ = 75 , = 0.07 , eps = 0.12 ) and EDR ( = 0.17 , eps = 0.18 ) detect 5 clusters with some minor errors .

Figure 4 shows another important aspect of the effectiveness of similarity measure . The parameter eps of DBSCAN specifies the range of the core objects and plays an important role to distinguish fiber bundles . Therefore , a better similarity measure should support the wider range of eps . In this experiment , we let eps run in the range from 0.01 to 1.0 with step size 0.01 and count the numbers of eps values which result in NMI score larger than 0.9 on the data set DS0 . The performances of WLCS and LCS are very stable , while the performances of the other methods decrease quickly when eps becomes bigger . Compared with the predefined threshold , WLCS succeeds 61 times , while HDD succeeds only 6 times . Compared with distance based techniques , threshold based techniques are more robust . The results are the same for all other datasets in our experiments .
B . Effectiveness of The Unified Similarity Measure SIM
We investigate the effectiveness of the unified similarity measure ( SIM ) and its characteristics . For the parameters of SIM , we simply choose δ = 50 , = 0.05 and α = 0.5 unless otherwise stated .
Table II shows the clustering results for various techniques on the 10 real datasets DS0 to DS9 , which are randomly extracted from labeled PBC datasets . These datasets contain 500 to 1500 labeled fibers belonging to 8 famous bundles namely Arcuate , Cingulum , Fornix , Inferior , Superior , Forceps Major and Corticospinal . Some fibers from other groups are also added as noise . SIM improves the clustering results . DS0 5 and DS7 8 are clustered exactly as gold standards . The other three are grouped with nearly perfect results . To further evaluate the performances of our algorithms on the task of whole brain clustering , we use 10 more datasets . Each dataset contains 5000 fibers which are randomly extracted from the PBC whole brain data set . The clustering scores are measured based on the labeled fibers only . The last column ( Full Brain ) in Table II shows the averaged NMI scores for all techniques . Threshold based methods are better than distance based methods . WLCS outperforms the other shape similarity measure techniques . And SIM clearly improves the clustering results .
C . Parameter analysis
Figure 6 shows the relationships between δ , and NMI score for the data set DS0 . SIM is more robust to the choices of the parameters δ and than WLCS . The combination with connection similarity not only enhances the effectiveness but also the robustness of the fiber similarity measure . Similar results are observed on the other datasets as well .
Figure 7 shows the relationship between α and NMI scores as well as their eps ranges ( with the threshold of 0.9 ) for the 5 datasets from DS0 to DS4 . On all datasets we acquire good and stable performances when α ≥ 03 the eps ranges in all datasets increase with α Besides ,

D . Efficiency of The Unified Similarity Measure
The combination of the shape and the connection similarity enhances not only the effectiveness but also the efficiency of algorithm . When comparing two fibers , the connection similarity measure serves as the first level lower bounding with only O(1 ) time complexity . After the first level has failed , the lower bounding distance of WLCS , is then examined with O(n ) time complexity . And the final step is WLCS itself . By the use of this multi level lower bounding distance , the runtime of algorithm speeds up considerably . the second level ,
Figure 8 ( b ) shows the runtime of eps range queries of SIM with different values of α . The smaller the value of α is , the faster query time and segmentation process are . Figure 8 ( a ) shows the runtime of WLCS on some real datasets . Since other techniques have O(n2 ) complexity like WLCS , we do not show them for clarity . As we can see , the use of the lower bounding distance significantly improves the performance of WLCS , especially for large datasets . With the multi level lower bounding distance of SIM , the runtime is further decreased . For example , with 5000 fibers , WLCS requires 8416 seconds . WLCS with lower bounding distance requires about 607 seconds . And SIM requires only 196 seconds . Compared with the other techniques , for the data set with 25000 fibers , SIM requires 30 minutes to finish , while DTW [ 8 ] requires 10 hours and MCP requires 3 days . SIM is faster than the others up to about 150 times . For a massive data set with 250000 fibers , SIM finishes within a day .
V . RELATED WORKS AND DISCUSSION
Brun et al . [ 6 ] consider two fibers similar if their start and end points are close together . However , this assumption is not always reasonable , since fibers in the same bundle may start and end in different regions [ 3 ] . Also , the shape similarity is totally ignored .
Most successful techniques use point to point correspondences to measure similarity . Zhang et al . [ 7 ] used the average of distances from points in the shorter fiber to their closest points in the longer one if they are larger than a predefined threshold . Ding et al . [ 5 ] defined similarity by using the mean Euclidean distance and ratio between corresponding segments of fibers . Corouge et al . [ 4 ] introduced the 3 widely used similarity functions : closest point distance , mean of closest point distance ( MCP ) and
7971018
Hausdorff distance ( HDD ) which measure fiber similarity by using distances between pairs of points of two fibers . Shao et al . [ 8 ] used Dynamic Time Warping ( DTW ) to measure shape similarity between fibers . All these techniques are sensitive to noise which may occur in fibers . Their distance mechanism is not sensitive enough to tell us whether two fibers have similar shape or they are separated by a small distance . The contribution of start and end points of fibers is also ignored , although it plays an important role in the segmentation [ 3 ] . Moreover , they have O(n2 ) time complexity which is obviously undesirable for large fiber datasets .
In literature , there exist many similarity measure techniques such as LCS [ 10 ] , EDR [ 9 ] , etc . Although they are well studied in the data mining fields , they are still unknown in the field of neuroscience . Therefore , understanding their performances on fiber context is essential for further researches on better methods for segmenting fibers . Our paper provides a comprehensive study for this problem .
The envelope scheme proposed in this paper provides an effective view on the shape similarity measure of fibers . As a result , our new envelope based techniques for fibers like LCS , EDR and WLCS acquire better performances and robustness than the existing distance based techniques like HDD , MCP and DTW ( see Section IV A ) .
The combination of shape and connection similarity provides a novel and robust similarity model for the white matter fiber tracts . With the support of the connection similarity , SIM is more robust to the choices of parameters and acquires better performance than the sole use of the shape similarity as showed in Section IV B and IV C . Moreover , SIM provides a flexible way for experts to customize their notions of fiber similarity by setting a suitable value for α according to their opinions . Thus , they may have diversified views about the white matter structures . By exploiting the connection similarity as a lower bounding distance , the scalability of our algorithm is greatly increased . Our algorithm can deal with even massive datasets as described in Section IV D .
VI . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE REMARKS
In this paper , we propose a novel and robust technique ( SIM ) for fiber segmentation based on the combination of the shape and the connection similarity measure . By using the connection similarity as a supplement , this combination not only improves quality but also speeds up the segmentation process .
Based on the new view on shape similarity of white matter tracts , we propose some new techniques namely LCS , EDR and WLCS which can efficiently and effectively capture the shape similarity between fibers . Our experiments have shown that WLCS outperforms other techniques on real fiber datasets . Also , threshold based techniques like LCS , EDR and WLCS acquire better and stable performances than distance based techniques like HDD , MCP and DTW . A lower bounding distance is also proposed for WLCS to
7981019 speed up the comparison , thus significantly decreasing the computation time .
Our future work aims at the incorporation of knowledge of experts into fiber segmentation to further enhance the performance .
