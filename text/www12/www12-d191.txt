With this information we analyze how participants differed in search behavior . Previous work on task difficulty indicate when users find a task difficult , they are unable to locate all necessary information [ 2 ] and spend more time to complete a task [ 5 ] . They also demonstrate high search effort but low search efficacy [ 4 ] . While previous research is not specific to medical searching , in our study , we conduct an in depth study to understand how medical task difficulty affects medical search behavior . for this study
2 . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN We performed an exploratory interactive user survey on a convenience sample of 60 ( 30 NMP , 30 MP ) participants in a university setting . The domain used is MedlinePlus1 . MedlinePlus is used as the domain of study because it only utilizes basic text based matching hence we are able to observe for ‘true’ interactive behavior . All participants except 2 ( NMP ) had prior experience conducting medical based searching . NMP perform medical searching as and when there is a need to do so . MP performed medical searching on an average of 2 hours per week . A total of 6 tasks were developed : 3 for NMP and 3 for MP . Participants are asked to carry out 3 search task each . The task was developed to fit the concept of a simulated scenario [ 1 ] . We did not develop similar tasks for both categories as it would be unrealistic to have NMP and MP search on the same task . Topics covered in the simulated task are based on prevalent cases observed in a public hospital . Tasks were verified by 2 independent medical doctors for clarity , accuracy and to incorporate varying levels of difficulty . Clinical based tasks are developed as this type of search is popularly conducted by NMP and MP [ 3,6 ] . All searches are confined to MedlinePlus . Participants are told that they could stop the search once they have found satisfactory result/s or could not find satisfactory result/s ( incomplete search ) . 3 . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION As shown in Table 1 , perceived task difficulty for both categories of participants is dissimilar . These values allow a baseline for us to compare aspects of a search session . Data is not normally distributed hence a H test is conducted to evaluate statistical significance . For NMP , a value of H=6.47 ( p=0.00392 ) is obtained for the number of queries issued per task .

ABSTRACT In this paper , we analyze medical searching behavior performed by a typical medical searcher . We broadly classify a typical medical searcher as : non medical professionals or medical professionals . We use behavioral signals to study how task difficulty affects medical searching behavior . Using simulated scenarios , we gathered data from an exploratory survey of 180 search sessions performed by 60 participants . Our research study provides a deep understanding of how task difficulty affects medical search behavior . Non medical professionals and medical professionals demonstrate similar search behavior when searching on an easy task . Longer queries , more time and more incomplete search sessions are observed for an easy task . However , they demonstrate different results evaluation behavior based on task difficulty .

1 . INTRODUCTION Medical search engines provide a wealth of information and enable medical searches to be performed quickly . However , nonmedical professionals ( NMP ) and medical professionals ( MP ) report many challenges when searching for medical information [ 3,6 ] . We investigate the affects of task difficulty on the search behavior of a typical medical searcher : NMP and MP . A participant qualifies as a MP if he/she has completed undergraduate medical education and is working as a physician , resident , medical officer or doctor . A participant qualifies as a NMP if he/she has not completed or pursuing any formal medical education . Participants are placed into one of these categories based on education and occupation . Besides occupation and education , perception of task difficulty for these categories of users could further vary based on knowledge and previous experiences . Upon completing each task , we asked participants to specify their subjective post search task difficulty using

H=6.47 ( p=0.0356 ) is obtained for query length per task and H=33.14 ( p<0.001 ) is obtained for task completion time per task . For MP , a value of H=3.27 ( p=0.195 ) is obtained for the number of queries issued per task , H=7.87 ( p=0.0195 ) is obtained for query length per task and H=13.72 ( p=0.001 ) is obtained for task completion time per task . We use mean , percentage and H values to interpret data . In an easy task NMP on average issue more queries ( p=0.0392 ) , longer queries ( p=0.0356 ) and took more time to complete the task . Queries in easy tasks are complimented with the use of more Boolean operators ( AND , + , “ ” ) and medical queries . Medical queries are not issued in neutral or difficult task . The average number of results clicked is similar regardless of task difficulty . NMP use more querying and results refining assistances ( features provided by MedlinePlus that users have to explicitly use ) yet experience more incomplete search sessions in an easy task . Low task difficulty caused participants to increase querying effort and refining of search results . Although more effort is observed in an easy task , this still led to a high number of incomplete sessions . Querying and results evaluation behavior of NMP differ in relation to task difficulty . MP searching on an easy task on average issue longer queries ( p=0.0195 ) and took more time to complete the task ( p=0001 ) There is no significant difference in the number of queries issued . More medical terms are used in queries for an easy task in comparison to a difficult or neutral task . However , the usage of Boolean operators did not differ across task . While more querying effort is observed in an easy task , this task had the most number of incomplete search sessions . MP used more querying and results refining assistance in a difficult task but clicked on more results in a neutral task . MP demonstrate different querying and results evaluation behavior in relation to task difficulty . NMP demonstrate high search effort in an easy task yet experience more incomplete search sessions . This same behavior is observed for MP . NMP rely on querying and results refining assistance in an easy task . However the usage of Boolean operators , results clicked did not differ based on task difficulty . MP spend more time and effort to refine results in a difficult task but clicked on more results in a neutral task . For MP the number of queries issued , usage of Boolean operators did not differ based on task difficulty . NMP and MP have different perceptions of task

11.7 2.5 7.5 38.4 20.8 11.3 difficulty . Our results show task difficulty can substantially impact search behavior of NMP and MP . Interestingly , medical task difficulty affects medical searching behavior differently in comparison to non medical searching . Our findings can inform the development of better medical retrieval strategies to be adaptive to search behavior based on task difficulty . This will help increase search satisfaction and efficacy . 4 .
