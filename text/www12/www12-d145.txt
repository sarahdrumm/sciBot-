ABSTRACT Onomatopoeia is widely used in food reviews about food or restaurants . In this paper , we propose and evaluate a method to extract onomatopoeia including unknown ones automatically from food reviews sites . From the evaluation result , we found that we can extract onomatopoeia for specific foods with more than 46 % precision ; we find 18 unknown onomatopoeia , ie not registered in an existing onomatopoeia dictionary , in 62 extracted onomatopoeia . In addition , we propose a system that can present the user with a list of onomatopoeia specific to a restaurant she is interested in . The evaluation results indicate that an intuitive restaurant search can be done via a list of onomatopoeia , and that they are helpful for selecting food or restaurants .

There are also user generated sites specific to restaurants such as “ Tabelog [ 1 ] ” in Japan and “ Toptable [ 2 ] ” in Europe and USA . A screen capture of a restaurant summary on the Tabelog site is shown in Fig 1 .
Fig 1:Restaurant rating summary of Tabelog . From left to right , ratings of taste , service , atmosphere , Cost Performance ( CP ) and alcohol are shown . In Tabelog , the users can read , write and share their thoughts and reviews freely about what and where they ate . The reviews totaled 2,908,529 as of Oct . 16 , 2011 , and this information is useful in selecting reviews often contain onomatopoeia to describe the taste , texture and look as indicated in [ 3 ] . Fig 2 . shows set of review sentences that include onomatopoeia inside . Onomatopoeia can express the status of objects or atmosphere more directly and delicately with better realism than is possible with general words[4 ] . Fujino explained that when people use onomatopoeia , it means they have an image that cannot be expressed in any direct way [ 5 ] . In addition , Ohashi said that onomatopoeia is increasing dramatically these days . For example , to express the feeling of deliciousness , existing expressions are “ hagotae ” or “ hazawari ” . However , we use onomatopoeia such as “ Mochimochi ” ( chewy texture ) or “ Sakusaku ” ( crunching sound ) instead [ 6 ] . According to a dictionary of Japanese Onomatopoeia [ 7 ] , there are 4,500 Japanese onomatopoeias . However , based on our observation on UGM , users create new onomatopoeia according to what they feel . In this paper , these onomatopoeias are called “ unknown onomatopoeia ” . For example , we there are onomatopoeias such as “ Mochumochu ” , “ Mocchuri ” and “ Mocchumochu ” , which are not defined in the existing dictionary . restaurants . The food or found that
WWW 2012 – XperienceWeb'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France719 These onomatopoeia are derived from base onomatopoeia “ Mochimochi ” ( chewy texture ) . We focus on the base onomatopoeia to extract unknown onomatopoeia . This paper proposes to extract both known and unknown onomatopoeia for foods from the reviews on UGM sites specific to food and a method that uses these onomatopoeia to search for restaurants .
Fig 2 Set of review sentences that include onomatopoeia inside , which are collected from the bagel community of a Japanese social networking site Mixi! . Both “ Mugyumugyu ” and “ Nejineji ” are frequently used onomatopoeias about bagels , which make the user imagine that the bagel is very tight and chewy .
1.2 Related works In terms of extracting onomatopoeia from the web , Asaga proposed a method to extract automatically from the Web corpus sentences that use onomatopoeia [ 9 ] . However , the number of onomatopoeias covered by the dictionary is only 80 , which is not enough to cover all Japanese onomatopoeia . Uchida collected snippets of blog posts that actually used onomatopoeia [ 10 ] , and made a database that links emotions to onomatopoeia . This research focused only on 299 existing onomatopoeia and did not deal with unknown words . With regard to using onomatopoeia for food applications , Asaga et al . proposed “ Onomatoperori ” : Food Recommendation System using onomatopoeia [ 11 ] , which enables users to find a recipe for cooking from among recipes posted on the “ Cookpad ” site using onomatopoeia [ 12 ] . However , as in the above research , the onomatopoeia used in the research was fixed in advance , and unknown onomatopoeia were not considered . Hirata et al . studied how onomatopoeia is used by Twitter users [ 13 ] . In these studies , Hirata asked those who followed the account of Hirata to answer the question “ what do you think is the onomatopoeia that expresses Japanese noodles?" . In response to the question , the follwers answer onomatopoeia “ Tduru tsuru ” that expresses Japanese noodles . This was not cost free to the followers and coverage of onomatopeias was not assured if number of the active followers are few . Apart from onomatopoeias , various methods have been proposed to extract unknown terms . Zhang proposed a method to identify unknown Chinese terms based on the Conditional Random Field model [ 14 ] . They construct a probabilistic field that expresses what word would come after another word . If a word appears with unexpected probability , it is regarded as an unknown word . Chen et al . proposed a method to extract unknown Chinese words [ 15 ] . They use the N gram method to extract candidate words , and they identify unknown words by using mutual information about the occurrence of candidate words . Qiu proposed a model to annotate appropriate parts of speech ( POS ) to unknown Chinese words [ 16 ] . It consists of two parts ; first they use a supervised machine learning method to predict the POS of an unknown onomatopoeia . For low credibility words , they use context words ( words surrounding the target word ) .
Adler et al . introduce an algorithm to acquire unknown words that is language independent . It disambiguates unknown words after being trained over the known words observed in the corpus and the distribution of the unknown words in known tag contexts . [ 17 ] . Morlanen et al . proposed a method to judge whether unknown sentiment words trigger “ Good ” or “ Bad ” emotion in people [ 18 ] . They proposed a method that uses five classifiers to assign prior sentiment polarities to unknown words based on known sentiment carriers . Existing methods try to assign POS or polarities ( such as “ Good ” or “ Bad ” ) to unknown words found during morphological analysis . However , the extraction of unknown onomatopoeias , which range over several POSs ( adverb and nouns ) and are created on a daily basis has not been proposed .
1.3 The purpose of this research In this paper , we propose a method to automatically extract both known and unknown onomatopoeia that characterize different food categories . In addition , we propose a system that can help the user understand a restaurant well by presenting a list of onomatopoeia that characterize the restaurant .

1.4 Approach We show the overall flow of the proposed method in Fig 3 . It consists of two modules : 1 . Offline system : Extract onomatopoeia specific to food categories and register them into dictionary 2 . Online system : Display onomatopoeia that characterize a restaurant in response to user ’s request . The first module focuses on the fact that most unknown onomatopoeia are derived from the repetition of a specific word , which we call the root onomatopoeia , the smallest set of characters . For is of “ Fuwafuwa ” ( softly ) . Therefore , root onomatopoeia from existing onomatopoeia and generate unknown onomatopoeia by applying derivative patterns . For example , we can extract the existing onomatopoeia “ Fuwafuwa ” , and use it to generate new unknown onomatopoeia such as “ Fuwwafuwa ” . The second module shows the user a chart consisting of extracted onomatopoeia and their frequencies to make searches for food and restaurant reviews both easy and intuitive . The charts allow the user the first we extracted root onomatopoeia “ Fuwa ” onomatopoeia the example ,
“ Fuwa ” from root the
WWW 2012 – XperienceWeb'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France720 to understand the characteristics of a restaurant at a glance without reading the reviews in detail . For each module , we evaluate following points : In order to evaluate the first module , we compare the number of unknown onomatopoeia extracted by the proposed module to that present in an existing onomatopoeia corpus . In addition , we evaluate the precision of the unknown onomatopoeia extracted , which means whether the proposed module can extract known and unknown onomatopoeia that are suitable for specific food categories , by conducting user surveys . In order to evaluate the second module , we verify whether the proposed onomatopoeia are useful to users who are looking for restaurants .
1.5 International applicability The target language of the proposed method is Japanese but many foreign languages also have many onomatopoeias . We believe that the system will also support foreigners in Japan . When we recommend traditional and original foods , which are unknown to the foreigners , they cannot imagine the food taste from the name of the food . By showing onomatopoeias which express the food , the foreigner will be able to understand the food ’s taste .
Step5 : Register the extracted onomatopoeia to the dictionary of Juman as word class “ Onomatopoeia ” . The example dictionaly for bagel is shown as below : ( Onomatopoeia ( (reading Mochimochi)(keyword Mochimochi) ) )
Step2 : Extract “ repeated onomatopoeia ” from collected onomatopoeia
Step1 : Collect from the top 100 review of articles in Tabelog
Step4 : Calculationof TFIDF of each derivative onomatopoeia.If TFIDF value is 0 , it ’s removed .
Step3 : Generate derivative onomatopoeia
( Onomatopoeia ( (reading Mocchiri)(keyword Mochimochi) ) )
Fig 4 : The detailed procedure of offline system of Fig 3 . This process extracts onomatopoeias specific to food category , and registers the extracted onomatopoeia into dictionary Iwasaki conducted an experiment investigated whether foreigners can understand the meaning of onomatopoeia from their sound [ 19 ] . They asked both native Japanese speakers and English speakers to listen to Japanese mimetic words for laughing . As a that of first is taste flow terms shown module result , English speakers construed many of the features of laughing in a similar manner as Japanese speakers . From this result , we assume that foreigners might be able to understand Japanese mimetic words and onomatopoeia from their sound . Although laughter is different from taste , some food onomatopoeias are derived from the sound that occurs when the food is eaten , therefore their conclusion has some applicability to our method . Nishinari et al . compare the texture terms of foods in different languages ; English , French , Japanese and Chinese languages [ 22].They confirmed that , after discussion , people agree on the fundamental features common to the different languages . Strauss presents a cross cultural/cross linguistic analysis of in food commercials from Japan , Korea , and the United States [ 23 ] . By the result of much of the discussion , they noted nuanced commonalities between the taste terms of different languages . From the above discussion , some of the Japanese onomatopoeias can be understood from their sound , nuance or other features . Section 2 describes it extracts unknown the first module ; onomatopoeia and builds a dictionary for onomatopoeia . Section 3 introduces the second module ; it helps the user understand restaurants easily by using unknown onomatopoeia . Section 4 details the experiments conducted and we conclude the paper in Section 5 . 2 . Extraction of onomatopoeia specific to food The in Fig 4 with the example of "Mochimochi"(chewy texture ) . As can be seen , the process consists of the 5 steps described below .
Step1 . Acquisition of food reviews In this Step , we collect a set of reviews from the restaurant review site Tabelog . The system automatically collects reviews from articles on the 100 most popular restaurants for each food category . Tabelog sets several food categories such as curry , Japanese food , and Chinese food . These categories are open to the public at Tabelog site . We use the search functionality of Tabelog that allows the user to search restaurant reviews for a specific category .
Step2 . Acquisition of onomatopoeia We extract the “ repeated onomatopoeia ” from the reviews . For example “ Fuwafuwa ” ( softly ) consists of the repetition of the root onomatopoeia “ fuwa ” . In order to extract repeated onomatopoeia , first we morphologically analyze the texts and collect words that are judged as either adverbs or nouns . Here , we use Juman [ 20 ] for Japanese morphological analysis . Juman outputs words with unknown POS that consist of repeated characters such as “ FuwaFuwa ” as adverbs . This means that if we collect nouns and adverbs , Juman outputs both known and unknown “ repeated onomatopoeia ” . Step3 . Generation of derivative onomatopoeia According to Suwa , in many cases , Japanese onomatopoeias are derived from root onomatopoeia [ 21 ] . Following Suwa , we use the six patterns shown in Table 1 to generate unknown onomatopoeia candidates , "derivative onomatopoeias" .
WWW 2012 – XperienceWeb'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France721 Table 1:Derivative patterns with example of “ Fuwa ”
Derivative patterns Root + Root Root + “ Ri ” Root + “ N ” Root +double consonant Root +double consonant+ “ Ri Root +double consonant+ Root
Example of “ Fuwa ” Fuwafuwa Fuwari Fuwan Fuwatt Fuwwari Fuwwafuwa
Step4 . Calculation of TFIDF In order to extract the frequently used onomatopoeia for specific food categories , we use the TFIDF method to evaluate each derivative onomatopoeia[24 ] . Our proposal uses two methods of calculating TFIDF . Here , Wi,j the weight of onomatopoeia i for food category j . Wi,j is calculated by equation ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) . represents
( 1 )
( 2 )
Here , tfi,j is the total number of restaurants in specific food category j whose reviews use onomatopoeia i , dfi is the total number of restaurants whose reviews use onomatopoeia i , and N is the number of restaurants ( in Tabelog ) . We threshold Wi,j and extract the onomatopoeias whose Wi,j exceed the threshold . The derivative onomatopoeias include noise in that some have no accepted usage . For example , "Gapegape" has the highest TFIDF value for the food category “ Ramen ” . However , “ Shikoshiko ” ( chewy texture for noodles ) , which has a lower TFIDF value , is frequently used in the context of Ramen . As seen from Table 2 , “ Gapegape ” was used in only one review .
4452 1
DF 7314 1
Table 2 : Example for onomatopoeia as noise Onomatopoeia TF TFIDF 0.61 Shikoshiko 1 Gapegape
We identify and eliminate noisy onomatopoeias as those that have extremely low tf and df values but high TFIDF . We determined the threshold for each food category heuristically by observing the top onomatopoeias . For example , in the food category ramen , set the tf threshold to 600 . We evaluate the effectiveness of eliminating onomatopoeias of low tf by comparing the method without elimination ( method B ) with that with elimination ( method D ) .
Step5 . Registration in Juman We register the onomatopoeia extracted by Step4 in a food specific onomatopoeia dictionary . Each food category has its own dictionary . Concretely , we make a new part of word class , "onomatopoeia" in Juman and use it to register the found onomatopoeia . Therefore , Juman can output onomatopoeia as word class “ onomatopoeia ” .
3 . Displaying onomatopoeias that characterize restaurants
Fig 6 shows the process of displaying onomatopoeias that characterize restaurants . As shown in the figure , the system consists of two parts : the client implemented as a Firefox add on and the server implemented as a Tomcat application and a C language application . We describe each step below .
Step1 . Acquire URL We get the URL of the page being browsed by the Firefox add on and send it to the server . Concretely , a contextual menu is displayed by right click on the top page . By choosing the menu item "Show Onomatopoeia" from the contextual menu , the URL of the top page is sent to the server ( Fig 5 ) .
Fig 5 : Firefox Add on for getting URL . This a screen capture of the contextual menu and the web page acquired after selecting one of the contextual menu items . The sentences in the red circle mean “ Show the onomatopoeia ( a code of letter is Shift_JIS or UTF_8 ) ” .
Step2 . Acquisition of HTML source The server takes the URL sent by the client , acquires the HTML source , and preserves it as a text file . We eliminate machine readable parts in the HTML source such as tags to minimize noise in natural language processing .
Step3 . Extraction of onomatopoeia for specific restaurant We extract onomatopoeias from the text by morphological analysis against the updated Juman . Note that the server chooses the dictionary whose food category matches that of the restaurant on the top of the page .

Fig 6:The detailed procedure of online system of Fig 3 . This process displays onomatopoeias that characterize restaurants .
Step4 . Weighting onomatopoeia for each restaurant In order to provide onomatopoeias that will help the user to evaluate the restaurant , we use TFIDF to extract the onomatopoeias that represent the characteristics of restaurants , and calculate the weights of each onomatopoeia . There are two candidates for TFIDF calculation as shown in equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . As described in the next section , we found that equation ( 1 ) is more effective in selecting characteristic onomatopoeia than equation ( 2 ) . Therefore , equation ( 1 ) is used for TFIDF calculation . In equation ( 1 ) , we treat tfi,j as "the number of times onomatopoeia i is used in the reviews of restaurant j" , in other words , it corresponds to the number counted in Step3 for each onomatopoeia i . dfi,j is the number of times onomatopoeia i is used in all reviews in Tabelog .
Step5 . Making Onomatopoeia graph In order the distribution of onomatopoeia used in the restaurant reviews more easily , we use a radar chart to visualize the onomatopoeias . To show the differences in weights of several onomatopoeias , we adopt two different weighting metrics of onomatopoeia ; one is frequency of the onomatopoeia used in the reviews of the restaurant and the other is TFIDF value of the onomatopoeia . We show a radar chart that adopts frequency as the weighting metric in Fig 7 , and the radar chart that adopts TFIDF as the weighting metric in Fig 8 . The scales in both Fig 7 and Fig 8 represent frequency because TFIDF values are difficult for users to understand . Step6 . Presenting the radar graph via the browser We present the radar charts created in Step5 to the user in a pop up window . the user understand to help

WWW 2012 – XperienceWeb'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France723 number of onomatopoeia that was judged as correct onomatopoeia in the context of each food category . In addition , Fig 9 shows the percentage of correct onomatopoeia among the top 30 for each food category and the method of sorting used ie A ) to E ) . As can be seen from the figure , sorting method D ) yielded the highest percentage of correct onomatopoeia , more than 46 % . In Table 4 , we present the result in “ ordinary people ” column , in which we list the onomatopoeias sorted by method D ) , and the checked ones are correct . We discuss each method here . Because A ) sorts onomatopoeia based on frequency , onomatopoeia which are used for several foods , not just bagels , are output ; eg , "Nakanaka"(pretty ) . As a result , the onomatopoeias specific to bagels are not found in the top entries . As for sorting method B ) , the percentage increases rather than A ) in the Bagel but decrease in the Ramen , This is because by using the TFIDF , we can increase the percentage of the onomatopoeias specific for each food category , however , as we described in step 4 of section 2 , a noise onomatopoeia , for example “ Zakun ” , or “ Hoyan ” , decrease the percentage of correct onomatopoeia . On the other hand , method D ) yields a higher percentage in all the food categories than B ) . This is because D ) uses the threshold of frequency to eliminate the noisy onomatopoeia . Although method E ) employs TFIDF and a frequency based threshold , the accuracy of E ) is not higher than that of D ) . This is because the df value of each onomatopoeia in the Tabelog site is small , so their TFIDF values are close to each other , which means that the effectiveness of df is small . As a result , method E ) yields results similar to method A ) . Table 3:Questionnaire derived onomatopoeia

412 Evaluation of precision of extracted Onomatopoeia by Tabelog User In order to gather correct onomatopoeias from food specialists who are knowledgeable about food , we used the reviews written by Tabelog users . Here , we define the onomatopoeias that the Tabelog users actually used in writing about food as correct onomatopoeias . This definition of correct onomatopoeias differs from that used in Section 411
Fig 8 : Radar chart of the top 10 onomatopoeias sorted by TFIDF 4 . Experimental Evaluation This section describes our evaluation of the proposed system . We conducted two evaluations ; one evaluated the coverage and precision of onomatopoeia extracted from the Tabelog site , and the other evaluated the user ’s reaction . 26 people participated , and three food categories were examined : "Bagel" , "Hamburger" and "Ramen" . 4.1 Evaluation of food onomatopoeia dictionary
We determined how many onomatopoeias are specific to food from the onomatopoeias extracted from Tabelog . There are five method for sorting the extracted onomatopoeias ; A ) order of frequency ie tf , B ) order of TFIDF calculated by equation ( 1 ) , C ) order of TFIDF calculated by equation ( 2 ) , D ) onomatopoeias whose frequency exceeds 600 are selected from those sorted by B and E ) onomatopoeias whose frequency exceeds 600 are selected from those sorted by C . We evaluated the top 30 onomatopoeias from those output by A ) to E ) . In order for participants to keep their concentration on the experiments , we only evaluate the top 30 onomatopoeias for each food category . We assume that ordinary people and food specialists use different onomatopoeias , so we evaluated the extracted onomatopoeias by both ordinary people and food specialists . 411 Evaluation of precision of extracted Onomatopoeia by ordinary people In order to gather correct onomatopoeia from ordinary people , we conducted a user survey . The question posed is as follows : We sort onomatopoeias which appear in the personal reviews of restaurant food according to rules A , B , C , D and E , in which we present the top 30 onomatopoeia . Please carefully read the list of onomatopoeias and check if you feel that the onomatopoeia can express the foods in the specified food category Here , we define correct onomatopoeia as onomatopoeia that was selected by more than half of the 26 survey participants . Table 3 and Fig 9 show the results of the survey . In Table 3 , we show the

Note that as our method extracts onomatopoeias from the reviews in Tabelog , it is certain that all the extracted onomatopoeias exist in the review site . However , some onomatopoeias are not used to discuss food . For example , the onomatopoeia “ tantan ” , which is the 1st ranked onomatopoeia of Table 4 , is actually part of the name of a type of noodle “ tantan noodle ” . To eliminate those noise onomatopoeias and count only the number of correct onomatopoeias the Tabelog users actually used in writing about foods , we searched for each onomatopoeia in the review , and judged whether they were used to describe food attributes . In this evaluation , we used only the onomatopoeia sorted by method D ) which shows the best performance in Section 411 To make judgment on the correct onomatopoeias , we examined 30 onomatopoeias for each of the 3 foods ( 90 onomatopoeias in total as shown in Table 4 ) . We present the result in Table 4 in the “ food specialist ” column . The correct onomatopoeias are 26 ( 87 % ) for Ramen , 17 ( 57 % ) for Bagel , and 17 ( 56.7 % ) for Hamburger . Tabelog bloggers are expected to know of and to use more onomatopoeias . This shows that food specialists use a wider variety of onomatopoeia than ordinary people when describing food . As specialists , they try to describe in more detail their feeling for the food or express the atmosphere of food with more realism , and so employ rarely used or new onomatopoeias . 413 Evaluation of coverage of extracted onomatopoeia In order to verify the extent to which unknown onomatopoeia could be extracted from the Tablelog site , we counted the number of existing onomatopoeia present in two other corpora . In this case , we use the onomatopoeias judged as correct by ordinary people in a on former contains dictionary
Section 411 One is the “ Japanese dictionary of the website Goo [ 8 ] ” and the other is the “ Japanese onomatopoeia dictionary [ 7 ] ” . The onomatopoeia , "Onomatopedia" . Here , we verify the onomatopoeia extracted for the three food categories of Bagel , Ramen , and Hamburger . We show the comparison result in Table 5 . As shown in the table , the dictionary of Goo held only 34 of the 62 correct onomatopoeias . However , most of these were registered as adverbs and only three were registered as onomatopoeia . ( See *1 in Table 6 ) . On the other hand , the Japanese onomatopoeia dictionary held 44 onomatopoeias . As can be seen , our proposed method offers wider coverage than existing corpora . It seems that synonym onomatopoeias are not present in the existing corpora . For example , in the Japanese onomatopoeia registered , "Jyuu*1Jyuu*1" and " Jyuu*2Jyuu*2 " , in which *1 is written as the long vowel indicator and *2 is written as small character of Hiragana in Japanese , is not registered . In addition , the Japanese onomatopoeia dictionary only offers “ Mochimochi ” ,(chewy texture ) but our dictionary also offers “ Mochumochu ” . As described , a significant point of our proposed method is that we can extract unknown onomatopoeias which existing onomatopoeias by derivative patterns .

42 Evaluation of user interface This section evaluates the effectiveness of the radar charts when displaying the results output by method D . 421 Evaluation of effectiveness of displaying onomatopoeia In order in understanding restaurants , we choose one famous restaurant in each food category , Ramen , Bagel , and Hamburger , and presented radar charts of onomatopoeias for each of the 3 restaurants to subjects who are the same as the participants of 411 ( # of participants are 26 ) . The subjects observed the radar chart and indicated how many onomatopoeia were useful to them . 46 % of the subjects indicated that 7 of the 10 onomatopoeias were helpful in understanding the restaurant . Onomatopoeias that has were not indicated as helpful included “ Kibikibi ” ( rapidly ) and “ Nainn ” . The former is indicative of the service provided not the food . The latter is associated with restaurant attributes other than food . Most of those onomatopoeias

44 71.0 can be eliminated by fine tuning the frequency threshold . It is possible that thresholding may eliminate all noise and we should deal with this in the future . 422 Comparison of restaurants Our system can also be used to compare restaurants , and this functionality was examined . Fig 10 and Fig 11 show the radar charts for two ramen shops . They were presented to the subjects who then indicated if they understood the differences in the restaurants intuitively or not . As a result , 69 % of the subjects understood the differences very well , 23 % indicated some understanding . According to the opinions collected from the subjects , the ramen shop of Figure 10 is probably oily and rich while that of Figure 11 looks plain and light . We also asked which onomatopoeias were most helpful in differentiating the restaurants . As a result , most subjects answered that “ Assari ” ( plain ) , “ Kotteri ” ( oily ) and “ Mochimochi ” ( chewy texture ) were helpful .
WWW 2012 – XperienceWeb'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France726 Next , we showed the subjects a brief description of the restaurants and pictures of its food . After that , we asked whether the impression acquired from the radar chart matched that acquired from the description and the pictures . As a result , 50 % of subjects indicated full agreement , 42 % indicated general agreement , and 4 % indicated disagreement . This indicates that the radar charts of onomatopoeias are very useful in helping users determine the difference between restaurants . At the end of the survey , we ask the subjects whether they wanted to use the system or not . 19 % answered very positively , 65 % answered positively , 11 % answered unsure , and 3 % answered slightly negatively . Our experiments verified the onomatopoeia for just 3 food categories . We should check the proposal ’s applicability to other food categories in future work .
5 . Conclusions We have proposed and evaluated a method that can automatically extract onomatopoeias , including unknown onomatopoeia , specific to different food categories , and build a comprehensive onomatopoeia dictionary . Evaluations confirmed that the method can extract onomatopoeias not covered by existing onomatopoeia corpora . In addition , since it combines TFIDF based weighting and frequency thresholding , the method can extract onomatopoeia appropriate for specific food with precision greater than 46 % . Moreover , we introduced a system that uses the proposed method to present onomatopoeia for specific restaurants . Evaluation results indicate that by displaying a radar chart of onomatopoeias , the system helps users understand restaurants intuitively , and is helpful for comparing and selecting restaurants . In the future , we plan to improve the accuracy of extracting unknown onomatopoeia and coverage . In addition , we plan to publish the system to web users , and verify the effectiveness of using onomatopoeias to help users understand restaurants by real user .
