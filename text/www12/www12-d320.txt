We analyze 2,885 campaigns for 1,251 products from the Advertising.com ad network . We compare our method with A/B testing for 2 campaigns , and with a public synthetic dataset .

INTRODUCTION
Evaluating the effectiveness of marketing campaigns is a key problem in Online Display Advertising . Under the CostPer Action ( CPA ) model , advertisers share the number of online commercial actions with the ad network . However , a significant number of users are not tracked because they either delete or reject cookies outright . Approximately 17 % of Advertising.com users are not tracked via cookies1 .
We develop an interpretative method , based on Dynamic Linear Models ( DLM)[3 ] , to estimate the impact of ad impressions on actions without cookies . We incorporate persistence of campaign effects on actions assuming a decay factor . We relax the assumption of a linear impact of ads on actions using the log transformation . We account for outliers with long tail distributions fitted automatically for each observation[3 ] . Our method uses aggregate data and is simple to implement without expensive infrastructure . We measure model fitting and prediction with 4 model variants ∗ Main contact . 1AOL Research and Development internal memo .

RELATED WORK
For reliable cookies , running experiments ( A/B testing)[2 ] , and correcting observational data[1 ] have been proposed to evaluate campaigns . These methods rely heavily on cookies , human intervention or user features . In contrast , we model the impact of ad impressions on actions to provide daily estimates without cookies or user features . 3 . METHODOLOGY
We use the indices : t=1:T for time , c=1:N campaigns , s for samples , and k for steps ahead in forecast . We define : Yt number of actions ; Xt number of ad impressions ; ξt cumulative effect of impressions on Yt ; ψt impact contribution per impression ; λ ∈ {0 , 0.88} decay rate of ξt ( persistence ) . DLM variables : θt latent state ; Vt noise variance for νt ; Wt covariance matrix of state evolution wt . We define a DLM :
νt ∼ N ( 0 , Vt ) Yt = F . θt = Gtθt−1 + wt wt ∼ N ( 0 , Wt ) t θt + νt
We define the model for N campaigns :
N . c=1
Yt =
ξ(c ) t + νt
ξ(c ) t = λ(c)ξ(c ) ψ(c ) t = ψ(c ) t−1 + ψ(c ) t−1 + w(ψ,c ) t t X ( c ) t + w(ξ,c ) t

We use mean relative squared error , MRSE , e=(Yt ˆYt)/Yt . For attribution , we find the proportion of actions described by campaign c . We also estimate the variability attributed to a campaign , R2(c ) , respect to data variance , base model squared error M ( 0 ) , and full model squared error without campaign c , M ( 0:N¬c ) . 4 . RESULTS t
We test the models M ω and M ωlog for the 2 base models defined . We analyze 2 , 885 campaigns associated with 1 , 251 products during six months . Fig 1 shows the model fitting and the proportion of actions attributed to campaign impressions . We use M ωlog with weekly seasonal base model . We observe that the peak in the first half of the action series is attributed to a gradual increase of daily impressions . Table 1 shows the fitting results . Better performance is reported when the log transformation is included suggesting a non linear relationship between actions and impressions . This model reports the highest campaign percentage with non significant effect according to Table 2 . Table 3 depicts the mean and variance over campaigns for R2 . Here , R2(c|var(Yt ) ) is lower for the weekly seasonal base model because actions are attributed to the day of the week .
We compare our method with A/B testing , which is expensive and requires significant human intervention , for 2

Both methods report one positive significant campaign at 90 % confidence level and one leaning towards positive effect . We also test our method with the PROMO dataset to compare with a ground truth . We use products with less than 6 relevant campaigns for 365 days . We detect 84.6 % of effective campaigns correctly , and 73.2 % of the days a campaign is effective per product . 5 . DISCUSSION AND FUTURE WORK
We have presented a descriptive DLM based approach to measure the effects of campaigns on actions without tracking users . Our experiments show that a model in the log scale is more suitable to describe the behavior of actions , and a seasonal base model gives less attribution to campaigns . We observed several campaigns with non significant average effect on actions , which is consistent with A/B testing results . Our ultimate goal is to provide daily significant estimates of the effects of campaigns on sparse actions . 6 . ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
