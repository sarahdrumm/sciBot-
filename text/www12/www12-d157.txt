ABSTRACT To understand the structural dynamics of a large scale social , biological or technological network , it may be useful to discover behavioral roles representing the main connectivity patterns present over time . In this paper , we propose a scalable non parametric approach to automatically learn the structural dynamics of the network and individual nodes . Roles may represent structural or behavioral patterns such as the center of a star , peripheral nodes , or bridge nodes that connect different communities . Our novel approach learns the appropriate structural “ role ” dynamics for any arbitrary network and tracks the changes over time . In particular , we uncover the specific global network dynamics and the local node dynamics of a technological , communication , and social network . We identify interesting node and network patterns such as stationary and non stationary roles , spikes/steps in role memberships ( perhaps indicating anomalies ) , increasing/decreasing role trends , among many others . Our results indicate that the nodes in each of these networks have distinct connectivity patterns that are nonstationary and evolve considerably over time . Overall , the experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for fast mining and tracking of the dynamics in large networks . Furthermore , the dynamic structural representation provides a basis for building more sophisticated models and tools that are fast for exploring large dynamic networks .

INTRODUCTION
Many social , biological , and technological networks contain dynamics that are important to model . The links , nodes , and attributes of these dynamical systems change

Naturally , these dynamic networks induce arbitrary patterns of connectivity that are challenging to identify in an automated adaptive fashion . To complicate matters further , the patterns observed in these dynamic networks are not necessarily stationary and may change considerably . In addition , these networks are usually large and a significant amount of data is continuously collected . All of the above issues warrant a fast completely automatic approach for identifying and tracking arbitrary patterns in large dynamic networks .
We address the problem of representing , tracking , and analyzing the structural dynamics of these large networks in a fast and completely automatic manner . Our approach captures arbitrary patterns of connectivity , has no parameters , and is fast for large networks ( linear in the number of edges ) . At the heart of our framework is the representation of the structural dynamics , which can be used to build a variety of sophisticated analysis tools . We use the structural dynamics framework for exploring the evolution of the network and individual nodes . Our approach lends itself to visualizations that clearly show how the behavior of individual nodes and the network as a whole change over time .
Consider a large dynamic ( or streaming ) network , how can we automatically learn the temporal structural behaviors of individual nodes and identify unusual activities or patterns ? For instance , in an IP to IP network , we may want to learn the “ behavioral roles ” of individual hosts and monitor the changes over time . This would allow us to characterize the dynamic behaviors of individual hosts and also detect when a machine or host becomes compromised or begins having unusual behavior with respect to the global network dynamics ( as well the dynamics of that local host ) .
For capturing the behavior of large time evolving networks , we propose a structural dynamics framework that essentially ( 1 ) extracts node features from a sequence of graphs over time , ( 2 ) discovers roles from the sequence of node byfeature matrices over time , ( 3 ) tracks the node memberships over time , and ( 4 ) captures the temporal dependencies of the nodes and roles over time . Our novel algorithm tracks the network dynamics and the behavioral roles of individual nodes over time . Behavioral roles or more precisely structural patterns are defined as a combination of similar structural features that were learned from the initial network . Since similar structural features are combined into a single role , then each role represents a different structural pattern ( or connectivity pattern ) . More specifically , the roles represent similar network features that were recursively extracted automatically . Therefore , if two nodes share a common role
WWW 2012 – LSNA'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France997 at a given timestep , then these two nodes are structurally similar .
Our novel approach provides a basis for analyzing the local node dynamics and the global network dynamics as a whole . Network dynamics refers to the structural patterns present in the entire network as it evolves over time . We posit that the importance of the learned structural patterns fluctuate and eventually change entirely . For example , the structural behavioral dynamics present in the initial Twitter social network in 2006 are most likely different from the structural dynamics observed today . This difference could be due to changes in their privacy policy , or the addition of features for twitter users or applications for mobile devices , etc . The frequency of the fluctuations and changes depends entirely on the dynamical system ( eg , social or technological network ) . In contrast , node dynamics refers to the structural patterns of individual nodes over time . We posit that the nodes structural behavioral dynamics are nonstationary , that is they change or fluctuate over time . For instance , the structure induced by emails for a given user may change during the work hours . Perhaps this user serves as a coordinator at work and therefore during the day their email activity represents structural behaviors such as the center of a star ( node with large number of incoming or outgoing edges ) or a bridge that connects multiple communities ( or departments in this case ) .
The main contributions of our approach are as follows : 1 . Flexible . The fast analytical framework for exploring dynamics can serve as a foundation for many other applications and tools .
2 . Non parametric and data driven . The important structural behavior of the given temporal network is represented without having to specify any features/patterns , making it applicable for exploring any type of network , and perhaps more importantly , making it a suitable candidate for real time anomaly detection .
3 . Efficient . The algorithm is linear in the number of edges and thus practical for large real world networks .
4 . Automatic . The algorithm doesn’t require user defined parameters .
5 . Interpretable . The roles can be interpreted with respect to simple traditional measures . The approach lends itself to visualizations that clearly show how the behavior of individual nodes and the network as a whole change over time . Interesting dynamic connectivity patterns are found in a social , technological , and communication network . The patterns are shown to be meaningful and agree with human intuition .
There has been an increased interest in mining , predicting , and exploiting the temporal nature of datasets [ 8 , 15 , 14 , 20 , 23 , 6 , 1 , 16 , 24 , 9 ] . Most of this work has focused on mining or modeling one aspect of temporal data such as the importance of nodes over time or attributes . In contrast to this work , we propose a scalable non parametric exploratory analysis method capable of discovering structural dynamic patterns and trends automatically in large time evolving networks . Therefore , our method is appropriate for mining social networks , communication networks , biological networks , among many others .
In addition to being applicable for a wide range of domains , the structural dynamics framework can be used for a variety of applications , such as : ◦ Dynamic Network Analysis . Our approach captures dynamic behavioral patterns of nodes ( eg , a peripheral node becomes an articulation point connecting two communities ) and the global network dynamics . ◦ Anomaly Detection . Identification of nodes or time periods with unusual structural behavior with respect to the global network dynamics . ◦ Sampling . The representation can be used to sample nodes from each of the learned network behaviors ( principle of diversity ) and adjust the sample dynamically as the behavioral roles change . This sampling strategy could be utilized for active learning on large networks . ◦ Graph Similarity . Given two sequences of graphs ( or graphs from different generators ) , we can measure the divergence between the learned features and behavioral patterns . As a simple example , if we learn 10 features for the Internet AS topology , and 100 from a topology of the same size from a generator , then clearly the topology from the generator has more complex connectivity than the true Internet AS . ◦ Generalizations . We may learn the structural roles on a single social network ( Facebook ) , and use these roles to analyze the dynamics of another social network ( Google+ ) . This indicates whether these two social networks are governed by similar social processes ( eg , homophily ) . ◦ Compact Representation . In the case of very large networks , the temporal network representation provides a compact and reasonable approximation of the most important graph properties and behavioral patterns . The representation serves as a foundation for building additional large scale tools and models for exploring and visualizing dynamic networks .
In this paper , we focus on using the structural dynamics for the first application . The others are left for future work . Section 2 provides a formal definition of our structural dynamics framework while Section 3 reports results using the framework for exploratory analysis . In Section 4 we discuss related work and in Section 6 we give some concluding remarks and future directions .
2 . STRUCTURAL ROLE DYNAMICS
Given a sequence of graphs , the structural dynamics framework ( or simply Role Dynamics ) automatically learns a set of representative features , extracts these features from each graph , then discovers behavioral roles , and iteratively extracts these roles from the sequence of node by feature matrices over time . The proposed framework is flexible in that any technique that learns a representative set of features ( ie , searches over the space of node and link features ) and role discovery technique can be used instead of the chosen one . In this paper , we use ReFeX [ 11 ] and RolX [ 12 ] since both have been designed implicitly for large graphs . Next we formally define the components of the structural dynamics framework . 2.1 Data Model for Temporal Networks
Networks accumulate a large number of edges and nodes over time . However at any given time , many of these edges and nodes are inactive . Nodes and edges can appear or disappear at any time . If a given node does not contain any

No assumption is made prior about the number of nodes or edges over time . Edges can be weighted or unweighted and be instantaneous or last for some duration . Multiple edges may exist between nodes . Nodes and edges may have attribute data associated with them that could also be temporal . A snapshot graph is defined by the nodes and edges active at time t . In the most general case , we have an ordered sequence of snapshot graphs represented as adjacency matrices At for t = 1 , 2 , , tmax where a nonzero i , j entry records the presence or weight of a link from node i to j . 2.2 Dynamic Behavioral Representation
We define our representation for dynamic networks , which includes discovering a set of representative features and extracting “ structural roles ” from this large set of features . Feature Discovery and Extraction . We use ReFeX [ 11 ] to discover a representative set of features . In particular , we start with degree features ( in/out , unweighted/weighted , and total ) and egonet features . The egonet includes the node , its neighbors , and any edges in the induced subgraph on these nodes . Egonet features include the number of in/out egonet edges and the total egonet edges as well as weighted versions of these features if the edges are weighted . Next , we aggregate the existing features of a node using sum/mean and use them to generate new recursive features . After each aggregation step , the algorithm prunes redundant features . The aggregation proceeds recursively over the current feature set , until no new features are retained .
For dynamic networks , we can learn a representative set of features and then extract them for each graph over time . More formally , given a time evolving network and any known attributes , we discover a set of features denoted L at time t and extract a node by feature matrix denoted Vt of size nt × f where nt is the number of active nodes and f is the number of features . The features for each network snapshot are extracted resulting in a sequence of node by feature matrices , denoted V = {Vt : t = 1 , , tmax} . The set of learned graph features for each timestep are shown to be minimal and representative . The graph features capture local , community level , and global properties of the temporal network ( through recursive aggregates ) .
Structural Roles . Using the representative set of graph fea tures , we discover structural roles using Non negative Matrix Factorization ( NMF ) with Minimum Description Length ( MDL ) model selection criterion ( see RolEx [ 12] ) . More formally , given a nonnegative matrix Vt ∈ Rnt×f and a positive integer r < min(nt , f ) , find nonnegative matrices Gt ∈ Rnt×r and F ∈ Rr×f that minimizes the functional , f ( Gt , F ) =
||Vt − GtF||2
F
1 2
The number of roles r is automatically selected using MDL . Intuitively , learning more roles , increases model complexity , but decreases the amount of errors . Conversely , learning less roles , decreases model complexity , but increases the amount of errors . In this way , MDL selects the number of behavioral roles r such that the model complexity ( # of bits ) and model errors are balanced . Naturally , the best model minimizes , # of bits + errors . See [ 12 ] for more details . The learned role by feature matrix F ∈ Rr×f represents the contribution of each role on the extracted features . After learning these role definitions F , we iteratively estimate node by role memberships for each network snapshot G = {Gt : t = 1 , , tmax} given F and V = {Vt : t = 1 , , tmax} using NMF . Afterwards , we have a sequence of node byrole matrices {G1 , G2 , , Gtmax} where each active node at time t is represented with their current role memberships . The structural roles provide an intuitive representation for nodes that is scalable and efficient to compute for dynamic networks . 2.3 Network Dynamics
Network dynamics refers to the structural patterns present in the network as it evolves over time . We posit that a subset of the learned structural patterns ( behavioral roles ) will become more or less important over time . Intuitively , a role may be active in a dynamic network only up to time tk , at this point in time , the role might become inactive , and a new role may emerge or a role that is currently active may become more important ( as the probability mass from the previous role is shifted to the current set of active roles ) . However , this process can only occur if we have a representative set of features over the entire time period . Suppose we extract features and learn roles from the first few timesteps , then in the future , there could be novel or more complex structural patterns that have not been represented . In that sense , we are interested in analyzing whether the behavioral roles represent basic generalizable patterns such as a bridge node , peripheral node , or the center of a k star , or if they represent more complex patterns that are prone to drift as the network evolves .
The global network dynamics are analyzed in two ways . First , we analyze the role and network dynamics using the previous formulation . The idea is that over time the dynamic roles may drift ; the role probability mass over the entire network shifts over time . The second way is by learning a single global set of roles , then tracking these roles as they become more active ( or important ) or less active over time . One might expect that certain roles would appear and disappear over time . The second method for learning a single set of global roles is formally defined below .
Global Features . For each graph At , we extract a set of features denoted Lt . The result is a sequence of feature lists {L1,L2 , ,Ltmax} , then we take the union of the feature sets L(cid:63 ) = L1
Ltmax giving us the set of unique
L2
WWW 2012 – LSNA'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France999 features over time . Using the list of unique features L(cid:63 ) , we extract these features from each network snapshot resulting in a sequence of node by feature matrices V = {Vt : t = 1 , , tmax} such that each Vt ∈ Rn×f . Global Behavioral Roles . Using the sequence of node byfeature matrices , we construct a single global node by feature matrix Vg ∈ R(n×tmax)×f by stacking the node by feature matrices {V1 , V2 , , Vtmax} . We factor Vg to discover Fg and use this matrix to iteratively estimate the node role memberships G = {Gt : t = 1 , , tmax} given Fg and V = {Vt : t = 1 , , tmax} using NMF . Afterwards , we have a sequence of node role matrices G where each active node at time t is represented with their current role memberships .
Role Importance . Intuitively , a role may be useful for some subset of consecutive timesteps tj , , tk , but then may become inactive and nodes that were previously assigned to the role may take on another more appropriate role . For this purpose , we define the relative role importance of the set of roles at time t as , t effint xt = GT where e is a vector of ones and GT is the transposed of t the node by role matrix at time t . The result is a sum of probabilities for each role over all active nodes . Naturally , if a role i goes inactive or becomes stale , then this roles importance decreases , whereas if a lot of nodes actively take on role i then this roles importance increases . 2.4 Node Dynamics
Node dynamics refers to the evolution of structural patterns for individual nodes . We posit that the nodes structural behavioral dynamics are non stationary , that is they change or fluctuate over time . Of course , in social networks , a nodes behavioral dynamics may drastically change over a few years whereas in other types of communication networks a nodes behavior may stay relatively stable over time . As an example , the structure induced by emails for a given user may change during the work hours . Perhaps this user serves as a coordinator at work and therefore during the day their email activity represents structural behaviors such as the center of a star ( node with large number of incoming or outgoing edges ) or a bridge that connects multiple communities ( or departments in this case ) . In the case of biological networks , a nodes behavioral patterns may consistently oscillate or fluctuate over time , but the underlying behavior may not drastically change .
For tracking the structural patterns of individual nodes , we use the previous methods to analyze the importance of roles over time . Using this notion , we can naturally observe when a node has increasing or decreasing trends of structural behavior ( eg , becomes more social over time ) , as well as periodicity ( eg , takes on certain roles during the weekdays versus the weekends or at work versus at home ) , or if the node dynamics are relatively stable .
Besides tracking node dynamics , one might want to detect if the dynamics of an individual node change and the time at which this change occurred . A simple approach might consider the similarity between the role membership vector for a specific node across time . For instance , if the node ’s role membership vector at time t is different from their previous role membership vector at time t − 1 , then this indicates that the node has changed behavior . We briefly discuss this problem of detecting node anomalies in §5 . 2.5 Scalability and Practical Issues The structural dynamics approach is linear in the number of edges . The complexity can be stated as O(|E|·|T| ) where |T| is some trivial factor ( even in the case where we use minute timesteps for analyzing IP traces ) . A more accurate upperbound on the complexity can be defined in terms of the maximum number of edges at any given timestep . In this case , we can state the complexity as ,
( |E|t ) · |T|
O max t
The structural dynamics approach can handle very large networks consisting of millions of nodes and edges . The method can be used in practice for analyzing many very large real world networks such as social networks , communication networks , citation networks , among many others . This is in contrast to other recently proposed techniques such as the dMMSB [ 26 , 7 ] . These models are quadratic in the number of nodes and thus unable to handle large networks . These models have been typically investigated on trivial sized networks of 18 nodes up to 1,000 nodes . Therefore , these models are unable to scale to the realistic networks with the number of nodes and edges in the millions . Moreover , the dMMSB can handle 1,000 nodes in a day [ 26 ] ( See page 30 ) , while our exploratory analysis approach for dynamic networks handles ≈8,000 nodes in 506.61 seconds ( or 8 minutes and 26 seconds ) shown in Table 2 . We provide performance results for other larger datasets of up to 183,389 nodes and 1,631,824 edges . In all cases , even for these large networks with over a million edges , our approach takes less than a day to compute and the performance results show the linearity of our method in the number of edges . For recording the performance results , we applied our method using a commodity machine Intel Core i7 @2.7Ghz with 8Gb of memory .
The proposed framework is also trivially parallelizable as features and behavioral roles can be learned independently at each timestep . This parallelization makes our method even more attractive and applicable for real time analysis of the trends and patterns of communication and social networks . Furthermore , the proposed framework can naturally be applied in a streaming fashion . The role definitions can be adaptively updated in a streaming fashion by monitoring the error .

The resulting network used for analysis consists of 183,389 nodes that have 1,270,285 edges between them over 49 timesteps of 15 minutes a piece . From this network , 268 features were automatically extracted from the initial timestep which resulted in learning 11 behavioral roles . Twitter ( Copenhagen ) . The network is formed by the set of 74,227 reply to messages in the #cop15 Twitter hashtag occurring over a two week period from 12/07/09 12/18/09 . See [ 3 , 2 ] for more details . Using a subset of this data , we constructed a network of 8,581 nodes consisting of 27,889 edges from 112 timesteps of 3 hours a piece . From the entire network , 729 features were automatically extracted , from which 12 behavioral roles were learned over time . 3.2 Global Network Dynamics We investigate the collective network dynamics of the Twitter social network ( See §2.3 for algorithmic details ) formed from the two week United Nations Climate Change Conference in 2009 . Figure 1 plots the relative importance of each role over time . This visualization clearly shows the changes in the global network dynamics . From this analysis , we find that the relative importance of some of the roles in Twitter naturally fluctuate between night and day ( see roles 1 & 2 ) , while other roles are more stable or stationary ( roles 5 & 7 ) , and therefore can be easily predicted . However , we also find roles that are more volatile , with seemingly no regularity . Role 8 is a prime example . This role represents a more complex connectivity pattern that arises infrequently . Thus , when the importance of this role spikes , it could indicate the presence of a global network anomaly .
A spike in the importance of role 6 is shown towards the last timesteps . This pattern is relatively different from the other smaller or more common cyclical spikes in the other roles . We also observe a type of step pattern in the importance of roles 1 and 2 ( among others ) . This step pattern is located towards the last few timesteps . Moreover , there is also upward step patterns ( see the importance of role 10 ) .
Perhaps more importantly , towards the end of time , there is a relatively common increasing and decreasing trend in the role importances . The increasing trend is most strikingly seen in role 9 or 10 whereas the decreasing trend is most strikingly seen in role 1 and 2 . Interestingly , we examined the twitter action log from this period of time and found that the communication patterns between the twitter users involved in the climate change conference drastically changed . Since the conference was coming to an end , there were less users tweeting about the cop15 UN climate change conference , and therefore the users that were still actively tweeting became more personal with one another , forming more densely connected subgraphs . Nevertheless , as shown , our approach captures these dynamical patterns that agree with human intuition in a fast completely automated manner . 3.3 Local Node Dynamics
We systematically analyze the evolutionary behavioral patterns of individual nodes in two large real world networks , namely , an email communication and an IP to IP network . Given a time series of role memberships for an individual node , we can identify unique roles for that node and detect when a node ’s behavior deviates from their past behaviors . Additionally , we interpret the roles with respect to tradi

Our results clearly indicate that the behavior of nodes and the entire network as a whole are changing over time , ie , non stationary . More specifically , we uncover the important dynamic patterns present in each of the communication , technological , and social networks . Overall , we find that the node and network dynamics in each domain are quite different . The remainder of this paper explores these differences in dynamics , among the other more specific behavioral questions posed below .
In particular , for each type of network ( social , biological , or technological ) , we seek to answer a few of the following questions . What are the characteristics of nodes with respect to their learned behavioral roles ? Does a node change slowly over time ( days , weeks ) or do nodes change behaviors continually throughout the day ? and are the behavioral role changes predictable ? Is there a normal progression of roles and are they cyclical ( eg , a role is exhibited in the morning , another in the afternoon , ) ? Is the behavior of nodes very stable over time or does it change a lot ? What patterns of behavior are there ? and are there local and global trends in the evolving behaviors ? Are roles generalizable across time or do roles drift over time ? 3.1 Datasets
The first two datasets are used to analyze the structural behavior of nodes over time while the last dataset is used to analyze the global network dynamics .
Email ( University ) . This network data consists of university emails from two weeks [ 4 ] . The email network ( whoemails whom ) was generated using email logs from the university mailservers . We only consider email accounts that have at least one incoming or outgoing edge in the trace . We used a subset of this network consisting of 116,893 nodes and 1,270,285 edges across 50 timesteps where each timestep represents 1 hour of activity . From this network , 652 features were automatically extracted from the initial timestep which resulted in learning 10 behavioral roles . Enterprise Network Traces . We use real network trace data sets collected over time on an enterprise network . The nodes are IP addresses and links are communications be

The other roles represent more specialized structural motifs as they are represented by a combination of structural characteristics .
Strikingly , we find approximately four major evolutionary patterns for the individual nodes . For instance , there are nodes whose structural patterns are relatively stationary over time . In particular , we see nodes that are consistently the red role , which can be interpreted as nodes with high clustering coefficient ( and other similar structural properties ) . We also find nodes that consists of mostly role 4 and role 9 which represent betweenness and clustering coefficient , respectively . Moreover , there is a slight downward trend in the structural pattern representing a combination of betweenness and clustering coefficient ( role 4 ) . There are also many other interesting patterns such as spikes in certain roles , cycles , and upward and downward trends in the structural behaviors of nodes over time . Additionally , we also find nodes that contain interesting patterns with respect to their activity and inactivity . In particular , nodes become active and then inactive frequently ( inactivity is represented as white ) .
Indeed , the structural dynamics approach can be used to understand the evolution of many real world networks . Figure 3 visualizes the node dynamics for the email communication network and interprets the corresponding structural patterns . Just as before , we can identify significant trends and patterns and interpret these using the role interpretations from Figure 3(b ) . For instance , node 67 has a sequence of stable roles over two time periods . In between these two time periods , there is inactivity . This is not surprising as the evolving mixed memberships represent only two days of email communications . The sequence of stable mixed roles for node 67 represent the email activity during the daytime , whereas the inactivity in between these two periods of time represents the night . Similar patterns can be seen in other nodes.We can also identify nodes that transition to a different set of roles or take on more of these roles at night , such as 1 , 2 , 39 , and many others . We also find nodes that have inconsistent behavior over the time , such as nodes 17 , 18 , and 19 , among others . The nodes with inconsistent behavior could indicate anomalous activity . Furthermore , we also find nodes that have relatively stable structural behavior over the two days , such as nodes 5 and 6 . This type of behavior is also unusual ( since we would expect a nodes roles to transition from the daytime work hours to nighttime ) . However , nodes that are consistently dominated by multiple active roles are of importance , since they connect to groups of nodes with different types of connectivity patterns ( see nodes 5 7 ) . Indicating that these individuals may serve in managerial or leadership roles .
Our approach clearly shows how the behavior of local nodes change over time . We also identify the differences in the dynamical patterns of these two networks . For instance , the individual node dynamics in the email communication network are more volatile than the IP trace network . Moreover , the individual nodes in the IP trace network take on less roles , while the nodes in the email network are often dominated by multiple active roles . Nevertheless , our method also captures similarities between the individual nodes in the two networks . Since the dynamics of nodes in both networks are controlled by humans , they naturally

( a ) visualizes the structural dynamics of individual nodes over time where each color represents a role . The x axis is time and the y axis is the proportion of each structural behaviors . ( b ) is the interpretation of the structural patterns with respect to traditional structural properties such as betweenness , biconnected components , pagerank , clustering coefficient , and degree . tional node measures [ 12 ] . Formally , the roles are interpreted using the dynamic node by role memberships Gt and a node measure matrix M t ∈ Rnt×m to compute a non negative matrix Et such that GtEt ≈ M t . The node measurements used are betweenness , biconnected components , pagerank , clustering coefficient , and degree . The matrix Et represents the contributions of the traditional node measures to the roles at time t . The contributions are averaged across time . The evolving behavioral patterns for a large set of nodes in the IP trace network and the interpretations of their dynamic roles are shown in Figure 2 . From the role interpretation , we most clearly see that the eighth role represents high clustering , while the fifth role represents betweenness ,

4 . RELATED WORK
While there is a lot of work on dynamic graph patterns [ 8 , 15 , 14 , 20 , 23 ] , temporal link prediction [ 6 ] , anomaly detection [ 1 ] , dynamic communities [ 16 , 24 , 9 ] , and many others [ 27 , 10 , 19 ] . No one has yet to propose a scalable rolebased analysis framework for large time varying networks . The closest work is that of [ 7 , 26 ] where they develop the dMMSB model ( based on a completely different process ) for small graphs . Their model is capable of handling 1,000 nodes in approximately 1 day while our approach is linear in the number of edges and capable of handling 1,000 nodes in only a few minutes ( practical for large real world networks ) .
5 . DISCUSSION
A network measure captures a particular feature of the network topology . For instance , social networks have a large clustering coefficient [ 25 ] while biological and technological networks have been found to have negative assortativity [ 17 ] . However , these features tell us only about a single pattern present in these networks , missing perhaps more important patterns of connectivity . Moreover , as societies change and biological systems evolve , these properties may no longer be of importance . Naturally , these dynamic networks induce arbitrary patterns of connectivity that are challenging , but important to identify . The traditional network measures usually capture simple connectivity patterns that can be understood quickly , while more complicated , less frequent patterns might actually be of more importance .
Instead of a fully automatic approach for mining large dynamic networks ( like the one proposed in this paper ) , one might imagine simply selecting features that are important for each type of network and tracking these over time . However , simply selecting the important properties for each type of network is incredibly difficult as the connectivity patterns and properties of these networks are not fully understood , and moreover , the network measures only capture simple connectivity patterns , making this manual selection impossible . Furthermore , this task requires expert knowledge in that domain ( biological , technological , or social networks ) , and there is no guarantee that these features are representative of the important structures that are truly changing over time . The properties also must be fast to compute ( linear in the number of nodes or edges ) and representative of the important connectivity patterns , which is also challenging . The main advantage of using a manually tuned simplistic approach over Role Dynamics is interpretability , while the disadvantages of such an approach are extensive . For instance , manually selecting measures for a specific network would be costly in time/money , inaccurate , possibly slow , it would not be adaptive , or able to capture novel connectivity patterns over time . Furthermore , in real time networks where the connectivity patterns are non stationary and changing very quickly , then even having an expert who can somehow select the important features is not enough as they would change before the system could be retuned . The algorithm proposed in this paper is applicable for any type network , completely automatic ( requiring no user defined parameter ) , fast for large dynamic networks , while capturing arbitrary connectivity patterns that are important for the given network . The main disadvantage of our approach is in the interpretation of the patterns over time . However , in this paper , we have used analytical tools to interpret and understand the dynamic patterns with respect to more traditional measures that have been widely studied by many researchers . In future work , we plan to build more sophisticated tools for analyzing and visualizing the important connectivity patterns present in each type of network .
Nevertheless , the Role Dynamics approach is a prime candidate for other applications such as real time graphbased anomaly detection [ 18 ] , dynamic relational classification [ 22 ] , and for predicting future structural patterns . The goal of anomaly detection in graphs is to detect nodes , links , or network states that are anomalous , and therefore the actual interpretation of the learned patterns from RoleDynamics are no longer important ( or of secondary importance for forensics ) . The majority of graph based anomaly detection methods define a set of particular connectivity patterns such as degree or clustering coefficient [ 21 , 5 , 18 , 13 ] . Therefore , these methods only capture specific known network anomalies , but fail to capture novel anomalies .
However , our proposed approach for exploring dynamic networks is non parametric and therefore learns a representative set of graph features that generalize over a class of time evolving networks . Thus , it is capable of capturing novel anomalies , making it suitable for IP communication networks where attack vectors may be novel and therefore unknown to even specialists . We plan to use RoleDynamics for detecting node anomalies ( eg , if a specific node takes on unusual roles ) and network anomalies ( eg , if the behavior of the entire network changes ) in future work .
6 . CONCLUSION
We proposed an efficient and scalable framework for mining the structural dynamics of large real world networks . Our novel approach tracks changes in local ( node level ) and global behavior over time . In particular , our approach captures arbitrary patterns of connectivity , requires no userdefined parameters , interpretable , and is fast for mining large networks ( linear in the number of edges ) . The approach lends itself to visualizations that clearly show how the behavior of the network as a whole ( Fig 1 ) and the individual nodes ( Fig 2 & 3 ) change over time . The proposed Role Dynamics framework can be used as a basis for more sophisticated models and analysis tools .
In future work , we plan to model the behavioral transitions over time and apply this model for prediction tasks like classification , anomaly detection , and for predicting future structure . We also plan to develop a clustering algorithm around this framework to group nodes based on their learned structural dynamics . Modeling the dynamics and the transition patterns of individual nodes will increase the effectiveness of our exploratory analysis framework .
