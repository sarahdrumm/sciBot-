ABSTRACT We propose a context and preference aware travel guide that suggests significant tourist destinations to users based on their preferences and current surrounding context using contextualized usergenerated contents from the social media repository , ie , Flickr . Categories and Subject Descriptors H33 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ] : Information Search and Retrieval General Terms Algorithms , Experimentation Keywords Photo collections , trip planning , context aware query 1 . INTRODUCTION Travel planning is often a difficult and time consuming task for people visiting an unknown destination . The proliferation of digital photo capture devices equipped with GPS and the growing practice of sharing public photos online using social media sites have resulted in a huge volume of geotagged photos available on the Web . Based on the assumption that tourist attractions are those places that are often photographed , geotags annotated to photos have been exploited for various tasks such as mapping geotags to places[1 , 2 ] , and recommendation of travel itineraries [ 3 ] . For the selection of locations to visit , tourists may have their own preferences . Furthermore , tourist’ interest to visit a location could be affected by his/her current contexts , eg , time and weather . Using contextualized user generated contents ( photos ) from the social media repository such as Flickr , we propose a system that is able to suggest significant tourist locations to users based on their preferences and current surrounding context . Existing methods addressed queries either with free of context constraints or with a few dimensions of context . Our approach has following advantages . 1 ) We synergize disjointed contexts and sparse social contents together with online information sources to enrich primitive contexts and contents with higher levels of semantic meaning ; 2 ) Context data is categorized to support more complex context based queries ; 3 ) We construct users’ interest profiles from their contributed photos to represent their implicit preferences ; 4 ) Locations are ranked for each user considering his/her preferences and location ’s significance , enabling users to receive recommendations that are more relevant and significant . 2 .

We discover locations using spatial proximity of photos and enrich the ____________________________________________________ This research was funded by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China ( No.2010ZX01042 002 003 001 ) , Natural Science Foundation of China ( No . 60703040 ) , and Science & Technology Department of Zhejiang Province ( Nos . 2007C13019 , 2011C13042 ) .

Figure 1 . System Architecture aggregated locations with semantic using textual tags annotated to photos in combination with information provided by online Web services . We build the profiles of locations to describe the contexts in which they have been visited . For temporal context , we exploit the geo and temporal tags annotated to photos . Whereas , to derive weather context we query third party weather Web services to retrieve weather conditions . For making recommendations , first we filter the locations based on contextual constraints , and then rank the locations by combining personalization score and significance score . We define a measure to identify similar users in previously visited cities and aggregate these users’ opinions to obtain personalization score for each location in target city for the target user . Significance score for each location is computed using a user expertise model that exploits the relationships among users , locations , and location categories . 1 ) Discovering Tourist Locations : To find highly photographed locations as the tourist places in a city , we employ P DBSCAN[2 ] to cluster photos using their spatial proximity . Given a collection of photos P , The output of a P DBSCAN is a set of locations L={l1 , l2…ln} . Each element l=(Pl , gl ) , where Pl is a cluster of photos and gl is the geographical coordinates to represent the centroid of location l and is computed from group of geotags annotated to photos in the cluster Pl . 2 ) Semantic Annotation : We utilize textual tags of photos in cluster Pl , similar as[1 ] to enrich location l with “ name ” . To infer the “ category ” of location l , we query Web service such as wwwgooglecom/places to provide metadata ( name and type ) of Point of Interests ( POIs ) that are within the area with radius r=200 meters from coordinate gl . Google Places supports 126 types to describe POIs for search queries . We further generalize these types into 6 categories , ie , education , shopping , religious , food , transportation , cultural , and entertainment . We select the “ category ” that is highest in frequency in the list of types associa

After annotation , a tourist location can be represented as l= ( Pl , gl , name , category ) . 3 ) Profiling Locations : To build the profile of a location l= ( Pl , gl , name , category ) , first we identify the visits made to this location by different users . We use photos Pl to infer set of visits Vl for location l . As a user can take more than one photo in a same visit , we sort the photos for each user using photos taken time . If the difference between the taken times of two consecutive photos is less than a visit duration threshold visitth , we consider both photos belong to the same visit . We use the median of time stamps of photos that belong to visit v as the visit time vt We use this v.t to retrieve weather conditions w , when visit v was made by user u at location l . Weather Services normally publish weather data at hourly , daily or monthly level that contain different variable like temperature , precipitation , etc . , to describe the weather conditions . We define an abstraction strategy to obtain abstract context concepts from raw contexts , ie , time stamp and weather variable . Eg , the raw context ( 21:30 , 25Co ) can be abstracted to ( night , warm ) . Given the set of visits Vl belongs to location l with associated context concepts , we consider the context concepts “ popular ” that are higher in frequency . For example , p(l.w)=(warm sunny ) depicts that location l has been popularly visited in warm and sunny weather conditions . After building the profiles of all locations , we maintain a locations database LDB={l1 , l2 , … , ln} . 4 ) Building User Location Category Graph : We organize three entities ( users , locations , and location categories ) and relationships ( visits ) among these entities into a meaningful data structure , ie , user location category tripartite graph GULC=(U ; L ; C ; EUL ; WUL ; EUC ; WUC ; ELC ) , where U , L and C are nodes to represent users , locations and location categories respectively . EUL and WUL are sets of edges and edge weights between U and L to represent users’ visits and the number of visits to particular locations . EUC and WUC are sets of edges and edge weights between U and C to represent users’ visits and the number of visits to particular location categories . ELC are edges between L and C to describe the categories of locations . 5 ) Mining Significance of Locations : We mine the significance of locations using a user expertise model , ie , generate a weighing of location significance through the number of user visits to specific location categories . ( 1 ) Given m users and n categories , we build an m×n adjacency matrix MUC . Each entry in MUC(p , q ) , depicts the experience of user up in location category cq . ( 2 ) To capture the relationship between users and locations , given m users and k locations , we build a m×k adjacency matrix MUL . So in matrix MUL , Ij={i} where MUL(i , j)≠0 , is the set of indices of users who have visited location j . We compute significance score of each location lj(j=1k ) , which is of location category cq(q=1n ) by : ( (cid:1864))=∑ ( cid:1839)(cid:3022)(cid:3004)((cid:1861),(cid:1869 ) ) as ( cid:3365)(cid:3043 ) . We compute the similarity between users up and uq using ( cid:1861)(cid:1865)(cid:3435)(cid:3043),(cid:3044)(cid:3439)=
6 ) Computing Similarity between Users : From matrix MUL , the user up ’s travel preferences can be derived as an array Rp=< rp0 , rp1,… , rpn> , where rpj is up ’s implicit rating(visits ) in a location j . S(Rp ) is the subset of Rp , ∀rpj∈S(Rp ) , rpj≠0 , ie , the set of locations that have been visited by up . The average rating in Rp is denoted

7 ) Recommendations : Processing of context aware query Q(t , w ) made by user up proceeds as a two step approach : an initial filtering step retrieves locations of the target city from locations database LDB and eliminates tourist locations that do not meet contextual constraints given in the query , thus producing a filtered set of tourist locations L’ . In the second step : personalization score for each location lj is linearly combined with its significance score to generate final rank score as : ( cid:3435)(cid:1864)(cid:3439)=(1−(cid:2016))(cid:3435)(cid:1864)(cid:3439)+ ( cid:2016 ) ( (cid:1868)(cid:3435)(cid:1864)(cid:3439) ) . Next the locations in L’ are ranked using rank score R as : p((cid:1864))=∑ and top k locations are returned as query result . Personalization score is computed using similarities among up and other users in previously visited cities by aggregating opinions of similar users

3 . EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS Dataset : We use public API of Flickr ( wwwflickrcom ) to collect 736383 geotagged photos that were taken in six different cities of China between January 01 , 2001 and July 1 , 2011 . Historical weather data of these cities is collected using public API of an online weather Web service wwwwundergroundcom Ground Truth : For evaluation , we select users that have visited at least two distinct cities {Co , Ct}∈C . To evaluate only those users who have provided a decent amount of preference information , we consider users who have visited at least 5 locations in “ training ” city Co . Evaluation Methodology : We predict the locations actually visited by test user up∈U in a “ test ” city Ct , based on preferences derived from the locations visited by that user in “ training ” city Co . We use visits made by him/her to tourist locations in “ test ” city Ct to obtain ; ( 1 ) the number of relevant locations denoted as k , and ( 2 ) the temporal and weather contexts associated with visits to build list of contextual constraints . We use these contextual constraints to filter the tourist locations by our context aware personalized recommendation method . We recommend k number of ranked locations using our personalized context aware method and other baseline methods . To evaluate recommendation methods for user up , we match the recommended list with the actual list of locations visited by him/her in the “ test ” city Ct . Baselines , Metrics , and Results : As baseline methods , we use ( 1 ) Popular Rank , ie , ranking locations based on of unique number of visits , and ( 2 ) Classic Rank that exploits the relationship between users and locations to apply HITS based inference model to rank locations according to their authority scores[4 ] . Table 1 depicts the effectiveness of our and baseline methods in terms of Mean Average Precision ( MAP@50 ) and Precision ( P@1 ) for the users who have visited at least 5 locations in Ct . Results show that , our proposed approach is able to predict user ’s travel preferences more precisely and generates better recommendations as compared to baselines ( paired t test with p < 005 )
