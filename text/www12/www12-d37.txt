ABSTRACT Most studies on social influence have focused on direct influence , while another interesting question can be raised as whether indirect influence exists between two users who’re not directly connected in the network and what affects such influence . In addition , the theory of complex contagion tells us that more spreaders will enhance the indirect influence between two users . Our observation of intensity of indirect influence , propagated by n parallel spreaders and quantified by retweeting probability on Twitter , shows that complex contagion is validated globally but is violated locally . In other words , the retweeting probability increases nonmonotonically with some local drops .

INTRODUCTION
Social influence has been studied by many researchers . However , most relevant studies focused on direct influence [ 4 , 5 ] while few touched indirect influence [ 2 ] . Normally , multiple intermediate persons called spreaders are involved in the indirect communication between two persons , ie , the sender and the receiver . Those spreaders may have a combinational effect on the indirect influence propagated from the sender to the receiver .
A concept closely related to parallel indirect influence is complex contagion , a phenomenon where repeated exposures of an individual to an idea recommended by his/her multiple neighbors positively affect the probability he/she will eventually follow that idea [ 1 ] . Romero et al . [ 3 ] studied the spread of hashtags in Twitter and quantified the probability of a user adopting a new hashtag as the function of the number of his/her neighbors who have already adopted it . They found that the spread of political hashtags validates

ACM 978 1 4503 1230 1/12/04 . the complex contagion , where the adoption probability increases monotonically as the number of neighbors who have already adopted the same hashtags increases , until a plateau is finally reached .
The problem we are studying is similar to [ 3 ] , but we focus on message spread behavior and indirect influence on Twitter . A concrete example of this is shown in Figure 1 , where Alice sends out original messages , Charlie and Carol
Figure 1 : Typical information spread in a social network further spread Alice ’s messages ( ie , by retweeting ) and Bob finally receives them . After that , Bob may choose to further spread Alice ’s messages to others , just like his two neighbors Charlie and Carol have done , or not . Here , the intent of Bob to further spread Alice ’s messages would reflect the intensity of the indirect influence of Alice on Bob , which can be measured as the probability that Bob will further spread Alice ’s messages , given that Charlie and Carol have already spread these messages . If complex contagion takes effect , the influence intensity will be higher when both Charlie and Carol spread Alice ’s messages than when either or none of the two spread them .
In this paper , we examine the intensity of indirect influence as the function of the number of parallel spreaders , between two users on Twitter , who don’t have direct following relations . We found that complex contagion is observed globally but is violated locally . Especially , when the number of spreaders increases from one to two , there ’s an obvious drop in the intensity .

Given a collection of tweets C = {t} , V represens all Twitter users while E = {(u , v ) |u , v ∈ V } represents all following relations where u follows v . We provide several formal definitions as follows :
• DEFINITION 1 .
[ Following Triple ] ∀t starting with “ RT @y : RT @x ” posted by z , we build a following triple Txyz = ( x , y , z ) , x , y , z ∈ V and claim that ( z , y ) ∈ E and ( y , x ) ∈ E . We also define C(Txyz ) as the total count of tweets that belongs to Txyz and C(v ) , v ∈ V as the total count of tweets v posted .
• DEFINITION 2 .
[ Spreaders ] ∀a , b ∈ V , we define spreaders between a and b as Sab = {y|Tayb = N U LL , y ∈ V } .
• DEFINITION 3 . [ N spreader Retweeting Pattern ] ∀a , b ∈ V we define a retweeting pattern Pab = {Tayb|y ∈ Sab} and |Sab| = n . Consequently , we define a nspreader retweeting pattern as Pn = {Pab||Sab| = n} , and Pab is an instance of Pn .
[ Retweeting Probability ] ∀Pab = ∅ , we define the probability of b retweeting from a as
• DEFINITION 4 .
P r(b|a ; Sab ) = ing pattern as P r(n ) = we define the retweeting probability of n spreader retweet y∈Sab
C(Tayb)/C(a ) . Consequently ,
P r{b|a ; Sab}/|Pn| .
Pab∈Pn
• DEFINITION 5 . [ Indirect Influence ] ∀x , z ∈ V ∩Pxz = ∅ , we think x exerts indirect influence on z . P r(n ) indicates the average intensity of indirect influence in n spreader retweeting pattern .
Our research question can be formulated as : Given n spreaders , how does the curve P r(n ) change with n ?
3 . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
The dataset1 contains 467 million tweets from 20 million Twitter users from June to December 2009 , which covers 20% 30 % of total public tweets during this period . Figure 2
Figure 2 : The curve of P r(n )
1http://snapstanfordedu/data/twitter7html shows the global trend of P r(n ) is increasing as n increases . That is to say , overall , the intensity of indirect influence tends to become higher , or at least persists , as more spreaders are included , which validates the phenomenon of complex contagion in the global level . However , there are two drops spotted in P r(n ) , ie from n =1 to 2 and 8 to 9 . We use t test of difference between two means to examine the two hypothesis : P r(1 ) > P r(2 ) and P r(8 ) > P r(9 ) . Both p values turn out to be close to zero , implying that the decrease is statistically significant and complex contagion is violated locally .
The emerging field of quantum cognition might be able to provide a potential interpretation for the decreased influence phenomenon . Notably , in the process of decision making where a decision depends on multiple factors , quantum cognition assumes that these factors are not independent but have quantum like interference effects on the final decision in a manner similar to the explanation for results from double slit experiments [ 6 ] . In Figure 1 , we assume that initially only Charlie spreads Alice ’s messages while Carol does not . Bob receives Alice ’s messages through Charlie and further spreads them because Bob thinks Alice ’s messages are relevant . Later on , Carol also begins to spread Alice ’s messages but they largely overlap with those already spread by Charlie . Bob therefore becomes less interested in Alice ’s messages because he ’s overwhelmed with redundant information . Thus Bob ’s intent to further spread Alice ’s messages ( ie , the indirect influence of Alice on Bob ) decreases . Here , the interference between two spreaders leads to destructive effects on the indirect influence from the sender to the receiver .
In conclusion , we investigated the propagation of parallel indirect influence on Twitter with a focus on how the intensity of influence changes with the number of spreaders . We quantified the intensity of indirect influence with the retweeting probability , and plotted the curve of retweeting probability against the number of spreads . We found that the phenomenon of complex contagion is validated globally but violated locally since the retweeting probability increases non monotonically with some local drops . We finally proposed quantum cognition hypothesis in an attempt to interpret the local anomaly yet further verification is needed . 4 . REFERENCES [ 1 ] D . Centola and M . Macy .
