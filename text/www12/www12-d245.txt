ABSTRACT In a dynamic social network , nodes can be removed from the network for some reasons , and consequently affect the behaviors of the network . In this paper , we tackle the challenge of finding a successor node for each removed seed node to maintain the influence spread in the network . Given a social network and a set of seed nodes for influence maximization , the problem is to effectively choose successors to inherit the jobs of initial influence propagation when some seeds are removed from the network . To tackle this problem , we present and discuss five neighborhoodbased selection heuristics , including degree , degree discount , overlapping , community bridge , and community degree . Experiments on DBLP co authorship network show the effectiveness of devised heuristics . Categories and Subject Descriptors H28 [ Database Management ] : Database Applications – Data mining .

INTRODUCTION Social network plays a key role in the spread of information and influence for target marketing and immunization setting . The problem , influence maximization [ 4 ] , is to find a subset of influential individuals ( as seeds ) such that they can eventually influence the largest number of people in a social network . Some greedy [ 7][9 ] and heuristic [ 1][2 ] methods are proposed to effectively and efficiently solve this problem . Mathioudakis et al . [ 8 ] simplified the network to boost the time efficiency of finding seeds . Goyal et al . [ 3 ] mined the past propagation traces to identify seeds instead of simulation based methods . Some variations are also proposed to tackle different real world requirements . Leskovec et al . [ 7 ] selected a set of social sensors such that their placements can efficiently detect the propagation of information or virus in a social network . Lappas et al . [ 5 ] found a set of effectors who can cause an activation pattern as similar as possible to the given active nodes in a social network . Li et al . [ 6 ] discovered a set of mediators which control the bottlenecks of influence propagation when seed nodes want to activate some target nodes . In this paper , we reveal another crucial problem for influence maximization in finding influential successors in a social network .
Considering a node , which is one of the seeds for the spread of fy a neighboring node of as seed , which has the best chance to influence , is removed from the network due to some reason . To maintain the effectiveness of propagation , one usually has to choose another seed as a replacement . This research tries to identi maintain the overall degree of propagation , In other words , when one seed node along with its incident links disappear , in order to maintain the influence spread , we would need a strategy to select the successor node from its neighbors as a new seed . . Note that in this paper we focus on finding successors from the neighbors of the removed seed , rather than from all the remaining nodes in the network . It is reasonable because people tend to transfer the jobs to somebody who is close to them .

There are potential applications in real world . For example , in viral marketing , if a salesman retires or is laid off , the manager might need to find a colleague of this person to transfer the duty of propagation can to maximize the influence spread . In blogosphere , if the favorite blog of a user is closed , the user tends to obtain needed information from one of the hyperlinked blogs . Preliminary . First , we adopt the Independent Cascade ( IC ) model
[ 4 ] for information propagation . In IC model , at time step each active node has a single chance to activate its inactive neighbors with a pre determined probability ( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:4667 ) . If succeeds , will become active in step ( cid:3397)1 ; otherwise , will not attempt to activate again . Second , based on IC model , the original influence maximization problem focuses on discovering a set of ( cid:1863 ) nodes ( ie , seeds ) such that the expected number of activated nodes incurred by , referred to as ( cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , is maximized . Third , we define a neighbor selection function ( cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , which is a one to one mapremoved node . Note that the neighbor set of a node is defined as the set of one step linked nodes from , denoted by ( cid:1840)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) . social network ( cid:1833)(cid:4666)(cid:1848),(cid:1831),(cid:1842)(cid:4667 ) , where ( cid:1848 ) stands for individuals and each undirected edge ( cid:4666),(cid:4667)∈(cid:1831 ) is associated with an influence probability ( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:4667)∈(cid:4670)0,1(cid:4671 ) as weight , ( b ) the IC model , ( c ) a set of ( cid:1863 ) seed nodes and the corresponding influence spread ( cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , and ( d ) a subset of , denoted by ( cid:1846 ) ( (cid:1846)⊆ ) , which is removed from ( cid:1833 ) , the goal is to find a new set ( cid:1846)′ ( (cid:1846)(cid:4593)∩(cid:1846)∅,(cid:1853)(cid:1856 ) |(cid:1846)(cid:4593)| |(cid:1846)| ) as successor nodes such that ( cid:4666)(cid:4593)(cid:4667 ) is maximized , where ( cid:4593)(cid:1846)′∪(cid:4666)\(cid:1846)(cid:4667 ) , and each ′∈(cid:1846)′ needs to be determined by ( cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)′ , ∈(cid:1846 ) . Our goal aims to devise the neighbor selection function ( cid:1858 ) to find the successor set ( cid:1846)′ mapped from ( cid:1846 ) such that ( cid:4666)(cid:4593)(cid:4667 ) is maximized . the neighbor selection function ( cid:1858 ) .

We present and examine a series of heuristic methods to develop es its own physical meaning and is able to determine the successor for removed node efficiently . We will conduct experiments to show and compare the effectiveness of the discussed methods . 2 . METHODOLOGY We present five neighbor selection heuristics , including Degree , Degree Discount , Overlapping , Community Bridge , and Community Degree , as discussed in the following . Degree is a commonly used heuristic to find seeds for influence maximization . Kempt et al . [ 4 ] reported that high degree nodes can outperform other centrality based heuristics . Therefore , we select the neighboring node with the highest degree value as the successor for the removed seed , ie , ( cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876)∈(cid:3015)(cid:4666)(cid:3047)(cid:4667)(cid:1856)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) . of the removed seed will be ( cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876)∈(cid:3015)(cid:4666)(cid:3047)(cid:4667)(cid:1856)(cid:1856)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , where the
Degree Discount is proposed by Chen et al . [ 2 ] , which improves the degree heuristic and nearly approaches the performance of the greedy method . The degree discount heuristic considers that the degree of a node should be discounted by the number of neighboring nodes which have been selected as seeds . Applying to devise the neighbor selection function with the IC model , the successor

Overlapping . We consider the social acquaintance of two individuals in this heuristic . The idea is that it is more reasonable and reliable to transfer the jobs to the most familiar friend . The familiarity can be measured by the number of common friends of two individuals . From the other perspective , if the position of a person is critical in the network structure , it is intuitive to find the substitute who plays the similar topological role if such person disap pears . Therefore , we find the successor of a removed seed based ie , ( cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876)∈(cid:3015)(cid:4666)(cid:3047)(cid:4667)(cid:1861)(cid:1857)(cid:1857)(cid:1855)(cid:4666)(cid:1840)(cid:4666)(cid:4667),(cid:1840)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4667 ) , where ( cid:1861)(cid:1857)(cid:1857)(cid:1855)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) counts the the number of overlapping neighbors , on number of common neighbors . Community Bridge . We assume that a node with connections to diverse communities , called bridge , can benefit the spread of influence , comparing to the node in the central position within a certain community . Thus , we aim to estimate the expected number of communities to which a node is attached . We consider that the extent of a node being a community bridge is determined by the connectivity of its neighbors . If the neighbors of a node connect with each other , they tend to become a clique and belong to the same community . On the contrary , if the neighbors have few links to one another , the node could be the bridge connecting communi ties . We select the successor of a removed seed by ( cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876)∈(cid:3015)(cid:4666)(cid:3047)(cid:4667)(cid:1829)(cid:1828)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , where ( cid:1829)(cid:1828)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)∑ ⁄ 1(cid:4666)1(cid:3397)(cid:1835)(cid:4666),(cid:4667)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:1835)(cid:4666),(cid:4667)1 if there is a link between and and 0 otherwise . neighbor selection function as ( cid:1858)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876)∈(cid:3015)(cid:4666)(cid:3047)(cid:4667)(cid:4668)(cid:1867)(cid:4666)(cid:1856)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4667)(cid:3397 ) ( cid:1867)(cid:4666)(cid:1829)(cid:1828)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4667)(cid:4669 ) , where ( cid:1867)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) is a normalization function .
Community Degree . Based on the community bridge , we further assume a node with higher degree and higher community bridging power could produce more influence spread . Thus , we devise the
∈(cid:3015)(cid:4666)(cid:4667),(cid:2999 )
,
3 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We conduct the experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method . We compile the DBLP bibliography data to a connected co authorship network , which contains 22,285 nodes and 49,365 edges in some recent premier conferences of data mining ( ie , KDD , ICDM , SDM , PAKDD , PKDD , SIGIR , WWW , and CIKM ) . The probabilistic weights on edges are determined by the number of co authorship between two persons . If #coauthor is higher than 100 , the edge weight is as 1 ; otherwise , it is set to #coauthor/100 . One will have higher potential to activate its neighbor if they have published more co works . We measure the effectiveness by the Normalized Decay of Influence Spread
( cid:4666)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4666)(cid:4593)(cid:4667)(cid:4667)/(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) . We compare the effectiveness of the prewhich the original seed nodes ( the number of seeds ( cid:1863 ) is set to be sented five methods while using a random successor selection method as the baseline . The results are derived by averaging 20,000 simulations of influence propagation of the IC model , in
100 ) are selected using the greedy method [ 4 ] to ensure the quality of seeds . we conduct the experiments under two different strategies of seed removals : ( a ) random removal , and ( b ) descending removal based on the influence spread of seed . The former is closer to real world scenarios while the latter is experimental one . By varying the number of removed seeds ( ie , the number of successors ) from 1 to 50 , the results are shown in Figure 1 and 2 . For the random removal of seeds , we can find the community degree outperforms others , while the traditional wisdom of transferring jobs to well acquainted persons ( ie , overlapping ) performs the worst . For the descending removal of seeds , similar results are reported except for the two degree based methods are competitive with the community degree . We think this is due to the fact that seeds removed in the descending order are really influential , and thus their neighbors have higher potential to connect with other influential nodes . Consequently , neighbor selection in itself is easy to find nodes connecting to diverse communities . In short , selecting successors with community based methods is effective , especially for the realistic case of random removals of seeds .

4 . CONCLUSIONS This paper introduces and defines the problem of finding successors while achieving influence maximization when some seed nodes are removed from the social network . We present and discuss five heuristics to efficiently identify the best successors for removed seeds . Ongoing work focuses on finding global successors from all remaining nodes in the network , instead of the local neighbors in this paper . 5 .
