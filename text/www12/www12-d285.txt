ABSTRACT Analysis to product reviews has attracted great attention from both academia and industry . Generally the evaluation scores of reviews are used to generate the average scores of products and shops for future potential users . However , in the real world , there is the inconsistency problem between the evaluation scores and review content , and some customers do not give out fair reviews . In this work , we focus on detecting the credibility of customers by analyzing online shopping and review behaviors , and then we re score the reviews for products and shops . In the end , we evaluate our algorithm based on the real data set from Taobao , the biggest E commerce site in China .

INTRODUCTION
A new user usually relies on the existing reviews given by the previous genuine customers before performing a transaction . Generally reviews include both review content and its corresponding real number evaluation ( rating score in short ) . However , although these reviews are not written by spammers , they still have two problems . Firstly there is the inconsistency between review content and rating score . Checking the reviews from Taobao(http://wwwtaobaocom ) and Gmarket(http://englishgmarketcokr ) , inconsistency between the review content and rating score generally exists . For example , some customers give high rating scores but write negative review content . Secondly some customers do not give out fair reviews . The reviews are affected by the customers’ characteristics .
In this work , we define Customer Credibility that refers to the reliability to customer reviews which are considered in calculating the average scores of products and shops . We focus on detecting the credibility of the genuine customers so as to help evaluate the real quality of both product and shop service , which has not been studied so far . Our solution is based on the following observations . First , nongood rated products is spammed with less probability than

In Taobao like E Commerce sites , customers are only allowed to give reviews to their bought products , which makes it different from Amazon or Ebay in the review systems . If there is spammed non good rating to the competitor ’s product , it will cost at least the price of the corresponding product . It will be expensive . Second , many products with high rating scores have unsatisfied review content which may be caused by subjective reasons and shall be used to revise the final scores . Third , customers , products and shops can construct complex business networks represented as a twin bipartite graph . By take full usage of these observations , 1 ) we construct a train data to train a classifier for scoring the review content to replace the rating score and 2 ) we design an algorithm to calculate the customer credibility by defining a mutual reinforcement relationship on this graph , which is inspired by HITS[2 ] . Our work is different with spammer detection[4 ] or review quality assessment[3 ] . Spammers can be taken as the special case of our work , who have very low credibility ; review quality assessment is generally to retrieve reviews with clear descriptions to product ’s quality instead of “ good ” or “ bad ” ratings . 2 . THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUE
The start point of our work is :
The proposed method contains three modules : if individual scores are consistent ( inconsistent ) with the scores of most customers , we can increase ( decrease ) individual credibilities . . Module 1 Review Content Scoring : We take the Maximum Entropy(ME ) model[1 ] to classify reviews ( content ) into two categories : negative and positive ones . Two steps are taken to complete the task . Step 1 is to define feature templates for ME model , which are classified into three types . Type 1 is the BASE Feature describing the basic information of review content , such as token number ; Type 2 is the Part of Speech Feature , eg NN , ADJ , and so on ; Type 3 is the Emotion Feature , such as emotion words . Step 2 is to construct positive and negative training data for the ME model . For negative data , we select the reviews with low rating scores randomly , which are supposed to be credible with high probability because of the high spamming cost . For positive ones , we can not select randomly from good reviews considering the inconsistency problem . However , we find , for the same shop , the returned customers are likely to assign high ratingscores and write positive review content . We select their good reviews as positive examples . We can then train the ME model and use it to assign the score for review content ( content score in short ) . . Module 2 Customer Credibility Analysis : We model
WWW 2012 – Poster PresentationApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France649 Definition 1 customer transactions by a twin bipartite graph called PCS ( Product Customer Shop ) defined as : ( PCS Graph ) . : A PCS graph is defined as P CS = ( V , E , Υ , μ , ν ) . V = {P ∪ C ∪ S} with P , C and S representing products , customers and shops ; E ⊆ P × C ∪ C × S representing transactions ; Υ is the credibility vector for customers ; μ and ν are the functions for computing the customer credibility from PC sub graph and CS sub graph respectively .
Based on this graph , we design an iteration algorithm to evaluate the customer credibility . And our algorithm relies on the following assumptions :
• Product /shop : If credible customers give high evaluations to the ( shop ’s ) product , we think the product ( shop ) is good . Good products ( shop ) will own high percentage of good customers . • Customer : If good ( bad ) products belonged to good ( bad ) shops are given low ( high ) scores by a customer , it supposes to reduce the credibility of the customer . If good(bad ) products/shops are given high(low ) scores by a customer , it supposes to improve the credibility of the customer .
The key is to design functions μ and ν for the iteration algorithm . Each function takes three steps : Scoring , Feedback , Normalization . We iterate the three steps until the credibility values keep unchanged . Initially , we assign uniform credibility values to customers . We only describe μ for PC sub graph here due to the space limitation . And ν is similar to μ . Scoring : In each iteration , we compute a combined score for each product by considering the rating scores or contentscores of the reviews it receives and the credibility values of its customers obtained in the previous iteration .
Feedback : There is a consensus : if there shall be good and bad products , the most highly scored products are good and the most lowly scored are bad . So after we get the product combined scores , we will order them decreasingly . Then we select the top m and bottom m items in the list as the representative products for good and bad ones . The feedback has two main steps .
The first step is to decide feedback type : positive feedback or negative feedback . As we have declared in previous section , if the evaluation of a customer is consistent with most of others’ , we shall increase the credibility of the customer ( positive feedback ) , or else , we shall reduce the credibility ( negative feedback ) .
The second step is to decide feedback quantity . The rule is that if a customer ’s score is more consistent with the classification , the customer wins more feedback value .
Normalization . After each calculation , we perform the normalization as HITS does .
We can perform the iteration based on PC or CS subgraph . Also , we can perform the iteration on PCS twin graph by running μ and ν interactively .
. Module 3 Product Quality Re Scoring :
3 . EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
Our experiment is conducted using the real data collected from Taobao . From the collected data , We extract the products and shops which have the returned customers as the test data .
Evaluation method : We sort the products ( shops ) in decreasing order by the scores and calculate the number of products ( shops ) Nk having returned customers among the TOP k % . The evaluation metric is : tk@T OP K = Nk/Nall , where Nall is the total number of products ( shops ) having returned customers .
We build four systems including ( 1 ) Baseline : ranking products or shops with the average rating scores . ( 2 ) SingleGraph : using the rating scores in step Scoring based on PC/CS sub graph . ( 3 ) TwinGraph : using the ratingscores in step Scoring based on PCS twin graph . ( 4 ) TwinGraph+ME : using the content scores from ME in step Scoring based on PCS twin graph .
Table 1 and 2 shows the results . From the tables , we find that our proposed approach outperforms the Baseline and TwinGraph+ME achieves the best performance .
