Abstract As social networks are growing in terms of the number of users , resources and interactions ; the user may be lost or unable to find useful information . Social elements could avoid this disorientation like the social annotations ( tags ) which become more and more popular and contribute to avoid the disorientation of the user . Representing a user based on these social annotations has showed their utility in reflecting an accurate user profile which could be used for a recommendation purpose . In this paper , we give a state of the art of characteristics of social user and techniques which model and update a tag based profile . We show how to treat social annotations and the utility of modelling tag based profiles for recommendation purposes .

He participates in discussions , shares knowledge and information , makes relationships , etc . As the social networks are growing in terms of number of users , resources and interactions , the user may be lost or unable to find useful information . Social elements could avoid this disorientation like the social annotations ( tags ) which become more and more popular and contribute to avoid the disorientation of the user . In most social adaptation systems , several components exist to achieve the adaptation process like constructing a social network which contains information about relations between different

Also in social tagging networks like delicious1 , citeulike2 , lastfm3 , etc . , we find a component which represents the tag assigned by a user in a specific resource ( ie : text , bookmarks , picture , etc ) This component is usually represented as 3D matrix [ 29 ] ( user , tag , resource ) , and treated as three bi dimensional matrix due to the complexity of the 3D matrix . We find also another component in adaptation systems which deal with the user through a user profile . This latter contains information about a single user like his personal information , his friends and also his interests . Researches try to represent the user as accurate as possible through different techniques ( ie : a weighted vector of terms [ 11 ] , enriching/extending a user profile [ 10 ] , etc . ) and languages ( ie : FOAF [ 9] ) . Modelling a user profile can be based on classic information ( name , age , etc . ) or on social annotations ( tag based profile ) . In this paper we are interesting in tag based user profile modelling . In section 2 , we present the main characteristics of a social profile , techniques modelling a tag based profile and techniques for updating tag based profile . In section 3 , we present limits associated with social annotations and how to treat this ambiguity . In section 4 , we present methods representing a tagbased profile in a recommendation context . In section 5 , we present a conclusion and perspectives . 2 . SOCIAL USER PROFILE MODELLING The social user is characterized with his social activity like sharing information , communicating with other users , etc . A lot of information provided by several users from different activities is represented in the social network . From this information , we need to know for example who tagged which resources or when specific information is shared . But this could be a difficult task if content is not organised and categorized . In order to organize and categorize this lot of information , some researches create social ontology ; others use specific techniques according to the context of researches . 2.1 Characteristics of social user Originally , a user profile is constructed either in a static way , by gathering information that rarely changes like name , age , etc . , or in a dynamic way , by gathering information that frequently changes . Information about a user is obtained explicitly by the

WWW 2012 – MultiAPro'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France969 the need of an intermediary entity user himself or implicitly by observing his behaviour during his session ( history , clicks , pages visited , etc ) The user profile contains information such as [ 33 ] : 1 ) Basic information which refers to the name , age , address , etc . 2 ) Knowledge of the user which is extracted generally from his web page navigation , 3 ) Interests which are defined through a set of keywords or logical expression , 4 ) History or feedback which design collected information form user ’s activity and could be deduced from number of clicks , time allowed in consulting resource , etc . and 5 ) Preferences which are characteristics of user describing preferences in specific links or nodes , they could indicated preference in page style presentation , colour , etc . With the creation of social networks , additional user ’s behaviours are created . In fact , the user is no longer representing the audience , but has become an active contributor for creating the information . Users become more active ( exchange social information , participate in groups and blogs , etc ) , and curious ( compare for a better information , search for advice , etc ) . This user ’s activity has merged new manners like social annotations . Indeed , resources are annotated by users without using defined languages . These annotations are plain keywords , known as “ tags ” [ 10 ] . Tags are a tool to mark resources , on the one hand for guiding others users to have information [ 16 ] , on the other hand to receive information about a user due to the history of tagging [ 15 ] . Tags are useful to improve the social navigation by analysing them . This improvement leads to avoid the disorientation of the user . Also , they are useful to categorize content in an independent way without ( ie : administrator ) [ 25 ] . This categorizing could be used in a recommendation context , where recommends information deduced from the user ’s tagging information . Tags become popular with tagging social networks like Flickr and Delicious [ 15 ] . Tags are assigned in several type of resource depending on the social network ( ie : in Flickr tags are assigned to photos and in delicious tags are assigned to URLs ) . According to [ 15 ] tags are used by users for many purposes like : contributing and sharing , making an opinion , marking a place for a future search , making attention , etc . Tags are interesting elements for building a social user profile . Some researchers do not consider tag ’s ambiguity to build a tagbased profile [ 23 ] [ 10 ] [ 20 ] [ 5 ] and others do [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 8 ] . Approaches which don’t consider the tag ’s ambiguity could have good results in a specific database , but we think that for building a tag based user profile , tags should be semantically treated in order to have an accurate profile containing meaningful tags . The action of annotating a resource by a specific user is called tagging behaviour . Many users can annotate the same resource by means of several tags which lead to collaborative tagging systems [ 12 ] . The collaborative tagging behaviour , leads to creating a folksonomy [ 10 ] . Unlike the ontology , this folksonomy is not structured . There are many models to represent the tagging activities . Researchers like Mika et al.,[24 ] represent the tagging activity in a tripartite model which describes the user ( U ) , the tag ( T)and the resource being tagged ( R ) : Tagging : ( U , T , R ) ( 1 ) An extension of this model is presented by Gruber [ 13 ] who added two new parameters compared to the previous model . These parameters are “ source ” which refers to the tag space where the tagger applies the set of tags ( ie : Delicious , Flickr , etc . ) and the parameter “ +/ “ which represent the “ collaborative system the tagging across multiple filtering of ‘bad’ tags from spammers ” [ 13 ] . This model becomes more popular than the original one . In fact , the space parameter used as a namespace contribute in application which deals with collaborative ( can applications differentiate between tagging data from different systems ) . With the popularity of using tags in social networks and their ability to reflect a user ’s opinion , many studies create a tag based user profile in different domains ( in the context of music recommendation[11 ] , in a social bookmarking context[23 ] , in touristic information sites[7 ] , in micro blogging sites like twitter [ 1 ] or for personalized search in social tagging systems [ 5 ] ) . Tags appearing in a user ’s profile could be deduced form resources he accesses [ 11 ] or from those chosen by him from a list of suggested tags or from those assigned directly by him [ 7 ] . Tags analysed in a user profile could be deduced from all tags like in [ 28 ] or by a specific rule like [ 32 ] which use tags which are largely used by two users and also tags which are strongly related ; or even by a specific formula like in [ 10 ] which uses the “ Borda Count ” technique to select candidate tags . Tag based user profiles reflect the representation of elements inside this profile such as a user ’s interests . Interests are deduced based on the analysis of tags [ 10 ] . Indeed , [ 28 ] consider preferences of a user as his individual tagging history , [ 11 ] use tags in order to generate interests,[1 ] distinguish between an entity based profiles representation which represent a user in a detailed and fine grained fashion , and topic based profiles which describes a user's interests into topics ( tweets ) considered as tags such as sports , politics or technology . 2.2 Representation of social user In order to represent information about the social user in a meaningful way , researches utilize for describing users a vector representation or a graphical representation . The graphical representation could be an ontology graph . The ontology graph is a structured representation which defines the relationships between terms , making it a structured vocabulary . Ontology aims to organize the user ’s content for better exploitation . The most popular ontology describing persons , their activities , and their relations to other people and objects is FOAF . This ontology describes only information related to the user and does not describe his the user ( representing through the FOAF ontology ) to the tag , another ontology describing the tag is needed . tagging activity . In order link to
221 Vector Many studies try to represent a tag based profile as a vector . Abel et al . , [ 2 ] represent tag based profile as a set of weighted tags for cross system user profile , as well as Firan et al . , [ 11 ] how represent interest as a weighted vector of tag and by definition : “ Tag based user profiles are defined as collections of tags together with corresponding scores representing the user ’s interest in each of these tags . ” . From interaction of tagging , Beldjoudi et al . , [ 3 ] define from the folksonomy , a tag based profiles as “ a transaction ID and the tags he uses by the set of items which are in this transaction . ” for recommending useful resources . Cai et al . , [ 5 ] also represent a user profile as a vector of interested tags and their degree of preference in order to personalize search in social tagging systems . Xu et al . , [ 31 ] define the user as “ each user u , is modelled as a vector over a set of tags ( or called user tag profile ) , ie , u =<w(t1 ) , w(t2 ) , ,w(t|T| ) > , where w(tk ) denotes the relationship weight of tag dimension tk with this user u ” , in order to recommend resources .
WWW 2012 – MultiAPro'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France970 222 FOAF Ontology As a social profile appears with the social networks , new representations and languages are created . The most popular social representation of the user is “ Friend Of A Friend ” 4 ( FOAF ) . FOAF was introduced in 2005 by Brickley and Miller [ 4 ] . It is an RDF/XML vocabulary and so it ’s easily extensible . It was developed to represent the user in social networks . FOAF is the only representation which describes relations between users through the element “ Knows ” . FOAF describes the user through five dimensions . In table 1 , we present the five dimensions and the FOAF specification for each dimension ’s attribute .

The first dimension named “ FOAF Basics ” represents the basic information of the user like his name , age , etc . The second dimension , named “ Personal Information ” describes personal information such as user ’s interest , blogs , etc . The third dimension named “ Projects and Groups ” describes groups in which the user is a member and the user ’s project ( generally his homepage ) . The fourth dimension named “ Online Accounts ” enumerates accounts associated with the user . The last dimension named “ Documents and images ” describes the image of the user profile and the document profile . A FOAF representation is used in recommenders systems , especially music recommenders systems [ 9 ] , in which the user ’s preferences are exploited through FOAF profiles and combined with musical preferences to recommend music . A FOAF is used also in management the user profile in cross system context [ 14 ] through the FOAFRealm , an extension of FOAF . Since the FOAF ontology doesn’t give details about the user ’s interest , an extension has been made to give more specific information about user ’s interests . This extension called “ eFAOF ” 5 . The e foaf:interest vocabulary has 3 versions : 1 ) "efoaf:interest Basic" , which describes basic information about the interest like e foaf:interest_value , e foaf:interest_appear_time , efoaf:interest_has_synonym and e foaf:interest_co occur_with , 2)"e foaf:interest Complement" , which contains complementary information like e foaf:interest_longest_duration and 3 ) "efoaf:interest Complete" which is the union of the set of vocabularies from "e foaf:interest Basic" and "e foaf:interest Complement" . More extension of the FOAF ontology are presented in [ 17 ] . 223 Tag ontology Many researchers represent tags as organized information through different tag ontology . We explain each type of ontology and compare them in table 2 , according to specific characteristics ( namespace , purpose , etc . )
Newman et al . [ 26 ] define the first formal tagging ontology as “ tags ” , which define the relationship between tags , resources and the user , as represented in figure 1 . The tag ontology defines a tag through its name tags:tag , a subclass of skos:Concept from the “ Simple Knowledge Organization System ” ( SKOS ) vocabulary , the person who makes this tag tags:taggedBy which is a subproperty of foaf:Agent and the date in which this tag is assigned tags:taggedOn is a sub property of dc:date from the “ Dublin Core Metadata Element Set ” .

Tags ontology have been explicitly reused and extended in MOAT6 ( Meaning Of A Tag ) ontology . It provides a machineunderstandable meaning of free tags . MOAT is related to the FOAF ontology and especially to its foaf:maker property to describe which user considers a URI as the meaning of a Tag . Such information is practical when retrieving meanings that have been specified by the user ’s friends . This tagging ontology integrates the “ Semantically Interlinked Online Communities ” ( SIOC ) vocabulary . SIOC vocabulary is used also in the SCOT7ontology ( Social Semantic Cloud of Tags ) , which describes the structure and the semantics of tagging data . SCOT reuses SIOC to represent groups of users via sioc:Usergroup . SCOT aims not just to represent the collaborative the characteristics of the folksonomy such as tag co occurrence scot:Cooccurrence , sharing of tag clouds scot:Tagcloud , etc . The idea of linking tags with well defined concepts from the Semantic Web is also adopted by the CTAG8 ( Common Tag ) ontology . CTAG is defined using RDFa , a standard format for expressing structured data within HTML . It defines how to create a tag through ctag:AuthorTag , if the content creator has specified the tag , through ctag:ReaderTag if a content user has specified the tag and through ctag:AutoTag if an algorithmic tagging system has generated the tag . tagging activities , but also to represent

A recent tagging ontology named Nicetag9 ontology is released by Limpens et al . , and aims to be flexible and applicable in any form of tag ontology ( ie : SCOT , CTAG , etc ) Tags are defined from the entity which creates them . The class nt:TagAction specifies this entity as a human entity ManualTagAction , a machine tag MachineTagAction or even as a collective tagging action CollectiveTagAction action tagging IndividualTagAction . This ontology reuses the SIOC through sioc:User defined as foaf:Person . In order to represent the resource being class nt:TaggedResource . this ontology uses individual tagged , the an or tag
( muto:hasTag ) three basic entities
More recently , Lohmann et al.,[22 ] developed a new ontology MUTO10 ( Modular Unified Tagging Ontology ) , which attempts to use many existent ontologies ( cited above ) , in order to enrich them by adding missing concepts and links . The MUTO ontology in a folksonomy : user represents the ( muto:hasUser ) , resource ( muto:hasResource ) . According to Lohmann et al . , users and resources are generic concepts and are better separated from the tagging ontology . So MUTO sets links to sioc:UserAccount and rdfs:Resource which have been proven useful the representation of Web users and social networks . 2.3 Tag based user profile update The social user is very active and may be interested in many different subjects for a short time . The updating of the social user could be a benefit in order to better know the user ’s needs . The and in

WWW 2012 – MultiAPro'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France972 the in user profile update
Tag based update is considered as an enrichment of the user profile , in which additional information deduced from the user ’s behaviour is integrated in his profile . The enrichment of the tag based profile helps recommenders’ systems to collect more information about the user and also in a cross system context , where the user may have multiple profiles . We present some approaches in both context and their respective techniques . 231 recommendation context In order to improve the quality of recommendation in social recommenders’ systems ; many researches use tagging behaviour which provides , implicitly , further user ’s needs . These needs , considered as complementary information about a user , could be used to enrich tag based user profiles . Indeed , De Meo et al . , [ 10 ] enrich user profiles by “ authoritative ” tags , which are tags considered as important ( for example tags having a high PageRank ) . This approach is graph based , where we find two graphs : the tag resource graph called TRG and the tag user graph called TUG . These graphs are used in order to filter qualitative tags ( ie : fun . good , etc . ) by the method of [ 6 ] , then generate list of candidate tags by means of the IDDS ( Iterative Deeping Depth First Search ) , and finally merging these candidate lists of tags by the Borda count technique . Finally , the user profile is enriched by tags from these candidate lists . This method has shown its usefulness compared to the method of [ 28 ] and [ 32 ] . Also , tags are automatically filtered and ranked at the same time through the Borda count technique . However , it does not consider semantics of tags and the context of user in the recommendation process . There is a risk of having no precise information through the Borda count technique even if it ’s simple to use and fast . Always in a recommendation context , Kim et al . , [ 20 ] enrich a user model with collaboration from other similar users . The approach uses locally weighted naïve Bayes approach to recommend a ranked list of items relevant to the user . The collaborative user modelling is made through detecting a user ’s neighbour by the cosine similarity and then enriching the user profile through the neighbour ’s topics . Even if the method is promising there is no consideration of the semantic aspect of tags . Finally , Beldjoudi et al . , [ 3 ] enrich user profiles with relevant resources based on association rules extracted from the social relations . The enrichment is used in resource recommendation context . In fact , for each extracted rule , the system tests if the tag is used by the user . If this is the case , the system recommends each resource which contains the associated tag of the rule . Each user in a folksonomy is represented by a transaction ID and the tags he uses by the set of items which are in this transaction . In order to improve the quality of the recommendation , tag ambiguity is detected by finding similar users and resources through the cosine similarity function . Although this approach deals with a tag ’s ambiguity , it does not consider the semantic ambiguity of these tags . 232 Tag based user profile update in cross system context In a cross system context , Abel et al . , [ 1 ] use semantic user modelling based on Twitter posts to create semantically rich user profiles . This method is graph based . The semantic enrichment from Twitter posts follow these steps : first link tweets , then the semantic enrichment is preceded by extracting content ( from “ BoilerPipe ” ) and information about users ( by “ OpenCalais ” ) and finally construct a new enriched RDF graph . The enrichment process considers the semantics of tags and the connection between users and also between tweets and articles . The method deals with the user ’s interests through people of interest , topics , event , etc . Always in a cross system context , [ 2 ] enrich tag based profiles based on association rules deduced from observation across two systems . The Tag based profile is enriched from different tagging systems by : 1 ) combining the user ’s data ( from different systems ) with 2 ) a semantic enrichment of tags calculated from tag similarity with the “ JaroWrinkler ” distance and a cross system enrichment based on association rules , and finally with 3 ) a weighting scheme ( like TF IDF ) . This approach is a good issue to model a user through his different social profiles , and to enrich this profile with semantic enrichment to decrease a tag ’s ambiguity . However , these two approaches do not consider the evolution of a user profile through time . 3 . TAG’S TREATMENT Despite these tag ’s advantages ( already cited in section 2.1 ) , tags are user generated terms and do not follow any rule . This characteristic generates many ambiguous tags . [ 15 ] present some problems related to these tags such as spamming where a user tags many resources by the same keyword in order to influence other users . Another problem is this folksonomy is very diverse . Indeed , tags may have different forms for the same word ( ie : blog , blogs , blogging ) . The folksonomy have a lack of classification and do not handle synonyms and homonyms . Due to the utility of using tags for many purposes , analyzing tags is required but could be a difficult task due to their ambiguities . Some researchers try to solve ambiguity associated to tags . In fact , [ 30 ] try to detect spam by proposing a concept named “ diffusion of attention ” , which can reduce the influence of spam in tag distribution and without a filtering process . This technique gives a maximum number of tags for each resource and so limits the influence of the user . Georgia Koutrika et al . [ 21 ] , define tag spam as : “ misleading tags that are generated in order to increase the visibility of some resources or simply to confuse users ” . They study the impact of spamming through a framework for modelling social tagging system and user tagging behaviour . They evaluate the impact of tag spam with a unit called SpamFactor . Also , a tag ’s ambiguity could be deduced in popular way by using a tool which can detect a natural language , synonyms/homonyms , etc . like WordNet11 dictionary . It could also be detected by classifying tags according to a specific ontology like [ 7 ] who classify social annotation as follow :
 Proposed tags/free tags : This category of tags is not detected by WordNet dictionary . There are invented tags . They could be recommended tags ( from the system ) or most popular tags or tags inserted by the user for the first time ( free tags ) . tags are Generic/specific recognized as “ general ” if they are mapped on the upper categories of the iCITY ontology ; “ specific ” if they are mapped on instances or lower concepts of WordNet related to the categories of the ontology ” tags : “ for each event ,
 Synonym tags : this category is identifiable via WordNet
 dictionary .
 Contextual tag : “ by means of the WordNet vocabulary , iCITY tries to discover whether the tag is related to the context of the event . It is possible only for tags with a well defined format ( eg time ) or tags which represent instances of previously identified as contextual concepts in WordNet ( eg location based concepts ) ” .

WWW 2012 – MultiAPro'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France973  Subjective tags : This category is not detectable by the WordNet dictionary . Indeed , these are tags which express a user ’s opinion
 Organizational tags : Tags which are used to organize an event . They are detectable if two users use them frequently .
This classification is related to the “ iCITY ” ontology used . But , this classification does not offer meaning to the tag . This idea of using an ontology to avoid tag ’s problem is existent . Indeed , from a plain space ( folksonomy ) researches extract a hierarchy ( ie : programmation/c# ) in order to extract a semantic and a comprehensive structure [ 15 ] . 4 . SOCIAL RECOMMENDERS SYSTEMS Tag based profile reflects user ’s interest deduced form the user ’s tagging behaviour . In consequence , tag based profiles are widely used to improve the quality of social recommenders systems . In fact , these systems aim to provide information which users might be interested in . This information could be deduced from the user ’s tagging behaviour , and integrated in a user profile . We present some approaches and their respective techniques , which represent a user from his tagging information in order to use it in social recommenders’ systems . Also , we compare in table 3 , these approaches based on specific criteria . Many researchers use the tag based profile for recommendation : De Meo et al . , [ 10 ] propose a query expansion in order to improve social recommender systems . The approach is graph based and recommends tags according to the candidate tags . It represents tags as weighted terms and filters them in order to eliminate the inappropriate ones . Kim et al . , [ 20 ] propose an approach which can be exploited in social recommender systems by discovering relevant and irrelevant topics for users . Topics contain weighted tags classified as positive and negative according to their rating . In portals , Nauerz , et al . , [ 25 ] analyze user ’s tagging behaviour to learn interests and preferences of users , groups , or communities for better adaptation and recommendation of tags and resources . They define a user in a static way through his basics information ( name , age , etc . ) and in a dynamic way by observing his tagging behaviour . This approach has shown good performance , by 90 % of users who classify a recommendation as pertinent . However , it doesn’t filter inappropriate tags . Xu et al . , [ 31 ] represent a tagbased profile for recommending resources based on graph theory . This approach detects a user ’s preference from a Topic Oriented Graph ( TOG ) , and then based on the graph devise a TopicOriented Tag based Recommendation System ( TOAST ) by using the preference propagation on the graph . This approach is promising but does not update the user ’s profile as his preferences change . Pan et al . , for recommendation by extending neighbour ’s tag through a cooccurrence analysis , filtering noisy tags through a clustering algorithm . All these works have shown good results , but do not consider the semantics of tags in the recommendation process . However , Carmagnola , et al . , in 2008 , [ 7 ] presented “ iCITY ” as an adaptive , social , multi device recommender guide which deals with cultural events taking place in Torino city . These cultural events , considered as resources , are recommended based on the tagging behaviour of users . The user is represented through tags reflecting his interests which are regularly updated . This approach supports the semantics of tags but do not filter inappropriate tags . Another approach which supports the semantic aspect of tags is [ 8 ] who proposes “ iDynamicTv ” , which architecture named an
[ 27 ] use a tag based profile recommends TV content ( video ) and navigates through resources , tags and users . This system initializes a user profile through predefined stereotypes and updates it according to his behaviour ( rating , tags , bookmarks , etc ) The “ iDynamicTv ” architecture is a good way to discover and organize TV content ; it takes into consideration the semantic of tags . However , tag ambiguity is treated with a semantic similarity using WordNet dictionary only and doesn’t consider spam ( ie : same tag for many resources ) and personal tags ( ie : like , awesome , etc . ) which affect the recommendation quality . In order to filter inappropriate tags and recommend useful resources , Huang et al . , [ 18 ] propose a tag based profile which includes the name of a tag and the corresponding number of items collected by the user for each tag . The tag information is considered as a preference or an interest which contribute to the recommendation of resources ( such as books , articles , documents , pictures , audio and video).  The method of recommendation creates as a first step the tag based user profile , then groups similar users , finding similar resources ( by the cosine similarity ) and finally recommending similar items to the user . This method decreases the tag ambiguity by filtering inappropriate tags and then the quality of the recommendation increases . However , this approach does not consider the evolution of the user ’s interest over time . In table 3 , we compare previous researches according to criteria related to the tag and to the user . The choice of these criteria is based on how they could influence the quality of social recommenders systems . In fact , for tags criteria , social recommenders systems should recommend the k most relevant information deduced from tags . To achieve this purpose , tags should be interesting to the user . The weight of tag criteria is a variable which reflects how the tag is important ( ie : popular , recently used ) . Social recommenders systems may recommend tags which are understood by a user and not by another . That ’s why tags and generate understandable ones is needed . To avoid this problem , the semantic aspect of tags could help to detect a tag ’s ambiguity previously detailed in section 3 . Another solution is to filter the folksonomy through the filtering tag criteria which eliminates inappropriate tags ( deduced from a semantic analysis or from a specific algorithm ) . For the user ’s criteria , we distinguish between user ’s representation , characteristics and user ’s interest update . These criteria are already detailed in section 2 . The representation of the user may be a vector , graph or other representation . This representation doesn’t influence the recommendation process , contrary to the user ’s characteristics criteria . The latter is deduced from the static representation and/or the dynamic representation . The dynamic representation includes the tagging behaviour , which is used to construct and update the tag based user ’s profile . Finally , the social user is an active entity and his interests may change several times in a short period . That ’s why , updating a user ’s interest is important to improve quality of recommendation context . The user interest update criteria , contributes then to improve the quality of recommendation by knowing the user ’s interest as they change over time.  treating

Huang et al . , [ 18 ] 5 . CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES In this paper , we have shown characteristics of the social user , techniques and ontology of representing a tag based profile , and techniques for updating it in a recommendation and enrichment context . We have also shown the limits associated with tags and respective solutions to the problems associated with these limits . Finally , the use of a tag based profile in a social recommendation systems and the comparing of recommendation approaches in table 3 . From table 3 , we observe that no approach considers most of the criteria , which are useful in a recommendation process . Form this comparison ; we plan to construct a tag based profile which takes into consideration the weight , the semantic aspect , and the filtering of tags and both the static and dynamic aspect of user profile representation , in order to improve the quality of social recommenders systems . Our idea is to gather information from the FOAF user ’s profile and from the tags assigned by the user . The motivation of combining two pieces of information is that the FOAF profile contains the interest of a user which is related to a resource representing by its URL . Also , a tag is reflecting the user ’s interest in a resource . The combination of the foaf:interest information and the tag information is based on semantic analysis and semantic distance . The update of the user ’s interest should take into considerations the social behaviour of the user including his tagging behaviour and social elements like “ similar ” users . Finally the tag ’s ambiguity problem is treated these through a semantic way , by extracting meaningful tags and by filtering the insignificant ones . 6 .
