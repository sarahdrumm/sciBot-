ABSTRACT Most web page classifiers use features from the page content , which means that it has to be downloaded to be classified . We propose a technique to cluster web pages by means of their URL exclusively . In contrast to other proposals , we analyse features that are outside the page , hence , we do not need to download a page to classify it . Also , it is nonsupervised , requiring little intervention from the user . Furthermore , we do not need to crawl extensively a site to build a classifier for that site , but only a small subset of pages . We have performed an experiment over 21 highly visited websites to evaluate the performance of our classifier , obtaining good precision and recall results .

INTRODUCTION
Web page classification has been extensively researched , and several techniques have been applied with successful experimental results . In most cases features for classifying web pages are extracted from the page to be classified , which requires downloading it previously . URLs are very useful when used to classify web pages , as they are relatively small strings ( therefore , easy to handle ) , and every web page possess one [ 4 ] . Furthermore , they allow to classify pages without downloading them , which results in a faster performance [ 1 ] .
In this paper , we propose an statistical technique to extract features from URLs in a not supervised way . These features can be used to build URL patterns that represent the different types of URLs in a site . Then , we can use these patterns to classify pages according to their topic , without ∗Supported by the European Commission ( FEDER ) , the Spanish and the Andalusian R&D&I programmes ( grants P08 TIC 4100 , TIN2010 21744 )

Table 1 : Evaluation results of academical sites . the need for downloading them first . We focus on pages from a certain site . Furthermore , due to the statistical nature of our proposal , we are able to achieve good classification results parting from a representative non labeled training set with a relatively small size .
Our classifier is based not on the words that a URL contains , but in its format . Proposals that use words as features require the URLs to be written a ) in human readable form and b ) using meaningful tokens , that is , using words that can be checked against a topic dictionary . In some cases , and more frequently as web sites evolve , URLs are less humanreadable . Therefore , these techniques may not work well when no understandable tokens are found . Our proposal overcomes this problem , as it does not require understandable words in URLs ; instead , it tries to find a pattern for each site ( which is feasible to find [ 2] ) , by means of the URL format . Hence , it is always applicable . More details of our technique can be found at [ 3 ] .
2 . PROPOSAL
The whole URL pattern building process is depicted in Figure 1 . First , we define the process to create a training set of URLs from a given site . Then , we calculate some features for each token inside each URL of the training set . Finally , we describe the algorithms used to build a set of patterns parting from the training set , using the previously calculated features .
We focus on websites that allow searching their contents by means of forms , ie , we focus on the Deep Web [ 5 ] . To retrieve URLs from Deep Web sites , we select a set of keywordbased queries and issue them using the forms . Each of the queries is usually answered with a hub page , ie , a list of results to the query , including a brief description of the result , along with a link to another page with the extended information . Once we have obtained a hubset , we extract and tokenise each URL from its hubs , to build the training set .

4 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In this paper , we present a statistical approach to the problem of classifying web pages in a non supervised way , relying exclusively in features extracted from the page URL . This approach has many advantages , namely : the user intervention is kept to a minimum , which saves user time ; pages are classified for features that are outside them , which avoids having to download a page to classify it ; it is a general technique , as it is based on the URL format ; and finally , we do not need to crawl extensively a site to build a classification model that works properly , but only small subset of pages . Our experiments confirm that it is useful to classify web pages with promising values for precision and recall .
In the future , we plan to perform a more extensive evaluation . Furthermore , we aim at using the URL pattern building technique to support the automatic publication of legacy websites information in RDF , to integrate this information into the Web of Data [ 6 , 7 ] .

Figure 1 : Workflow to build a classifier
Note that we do not need to crawl extensively a website to obtain a training set , but only a small representative subset of pages .
Traditional classification algorithms are based on distances between the different elements . However , it has been noticed that edit distance measures applied to URLs do not seem to provide enough support to classify URLs according to the concept contained in their targets [ 2 ] , ie , two URLs separated by a very small distance may provide information about two different concepts , while distant URLs may be related to pages with similar concepts . Therefore , our approach is based on probabilistic features instead to build the pattern set . More precisely , That is , we calculate a feature value for each token in a URL as the relative size of the subset of hubs from a hubset which have at least one URL that shares a common prefix with it up to that token ( included ) , in relation with the total size of the hubset .
These feature values range from 0.0 ( least frequent tokens ) to 1.0 ( most frequent tokens ) . The most frequent tokens are usually part of the URL patterns , whilst the least frequent tokens are usually parameter values or something similar . To create URL patterns , we check the feature value of each token t in each URL , and decide whether to keep the token as a literal , or to replace it with a more abstract representation ( ie , a wildcard ( cid:63) ) , depending on its feature value . This decision is based on a statistical analysis of the distribution of feature values in other tokens that occupy the same position as t in other URLs . For example , URL http://wwwamazon com/Head First Java/dp?ie=UTF 8&qid=123 gives pattern http://wwwamazoncom/(cid:63)/dp?ie=UTF 8&qid=(cid:63 ) , that represents all links to product information pages in Amazon .
3 . EVALUATION
We performed an experiment to assess our technique . We selected the top 16 more visited sites according to Alexa Web Directory plus five academical sites . On each website , we located search forms and issued queries using a dictionary composed of the most frequent words in different domains and languages . We defined some classes for each website , by generating XPath expressions , and we measured the Precision ( P ) , Recall ( R ) and F1 measure ( F1 ) of our classifier in a 10 fold cross validation .
The main results of the experiment are presented in Tables 1 and 2 . For each site in the experiment , we show the number of pages and URLs that compose the training set , the precision , recall and F1 measure , obtaining a mean precision of 0.95 and a mean recall of 085
