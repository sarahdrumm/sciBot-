ABSTRACT  Nollywood is the second largest movie industry in the world in terms of annual movie production . A dominant number of the movies are in Yoruba language spoken by over 20 million people across the globe . The number of Yoruba language movies uploaded to YouTube and their corresponding comments is growing exponentially . However , YouTube comments made by native speakers on Yoruba movies combine English language , Yoruba language , and other commonly used “ pidgin ” Yoruba language words . Since Yoruba is still a resource constrained language , existing sentiment or subjectivity analysis algorithms have poor performances on YouTube comments made on Yoruba language movies . This is because of the constrained language ambiguities . In this work , we present an automatic sentiment analysis algorithm language movies . The for YouTube comments on Yoruba algorithm uses SentiWordNet lexicon of commonly used Yoruba language sentiment words and phrases . In terms of precision recall , the algorithm performs more than a stateof the art sentiment analysis technique by up to 20 % .

Sentiment analysis on movie comments has become very useful in improving the quality of movies and satisfying the demands of the consumers . The number of movies and comments on YouTube is growing exponentially [ 4 ] . With sentiment analysis , substantial comments can be mined for positive , negative and neutral sentiments . This can help in satisfying viewers’ experience and automatic recommendation of movies to interest groups . However , sentiments expressed using a resource constrained language pose very difficult task for existing sentiment analysis algorithms . In this work , we perform sentiment analysis for YouTube comments on Yoruba language movies . Yoruba language is resource constrained and the native speakers often use a combination of the language , English language , and other “ pidgin ” Yoruba language words in YouTube comments . This causes ambiguity problem for existing sentiment analysis algorithms and therefore affects their efficiencies . For example , consider the following sentence from a YouTube comment on a Yoruba movie .

( 1 ) Yes oooooo! I gbádùn dis movie láti òkè dé ìsàlè .
In the sentence above some words that express sentiments are actually written in Yoruba language or “ pidgin ” Yoruba language . A formalized interpretation of the above sentence in English language is as follows :
( 2 ) Great! I enjoyed this movie from the beginning to the end .
From this interpretation , words that express sentiments are shown in italics . In the context of YouTube comments on nollywood movies , the phrase Yes oooooo! is a “ pidgin ” expression of great or interesting mood . The frequency of alphabet ‘o’ in the phrase can also vary depending on the intensity of the mood . For example , yes ooo , yes oooooo , and yes oooooooo . Whereas , such words are seen as ambiguities by the existing sentiment analysis algorithms . While it could be tempting to rely on the number of “ likes ” and “ dislikes ” in YouTube comments to measure the overall sentiments on a movie , the two numbers combined is often lower than the total number of comments and thus cannot show the absolute sentiment distribution on the movie .
In this paper , our contributions are twofolds . First , we develop a sentiment lexicon for Yoruba language . The lexicon contains Yoruba language words and phrases commonly used to express sentiments in YouTube comments on Yoruba movies . We manually annotate such words based on their polarity of sentiments . We evaluate the annotations using Inter Annotator Agreement Study . Finally , we develop a sentiment analysis algorithm that interpolates the score of English sentiment words with the score of Yoruba sentiment words to give a final sentiment polarity score for each comment . 2 . SENTIMENT ANNOTATION 2.1 Corpus For the purpose of this work , a corpus containing YouTube comments on Yoruba language movies has been created . The corpus contains 15,000 YouTube comments manually collected from 270 Yoruba language movies between May , 2011 and July , 2011 . The detail of the corpus is shown in Table 1 . The corpus and our sentiment analysis algorithm is also publicly available for research purpose1 . Table 1 . Details for corpus of YouTube comments on Yoruba movies

2.2 Annotation Using the corpus above , we asked participants to identify and label Yoruba words , phrases , and “ pidgin ” yoruba words that express “ positive ” or “ negative ” or “ neutral ” sentiments in each comment .

WWW 2012 – Poster PresentationApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France583 We do not take “ mixed ” sentiments into account since the study conducted in [ 2 ] reported that “ mixed ” category gives low agreement at minimal granulity such as sentences found in YouTube comments . We then measure inter annotator reliability for all comments in the corpus . Our 5 participants were postgraduate students whom are all native Yoruba speakers including one whom has worked on sentiment analysis . In the annotation process , participants were asked to score each sentiment word or phrase labeled with a value between 0 and 1 . In total 1,076 words and phrase were annotated out of which 478 are positive , 301 are negative , and 297 are neutral . 2.3 Inter Annotator Agreement We used the statistical method adopted in [ 2 ] to measure our interannotator agreement study . This is beacause our corpus is large and the statistical method does not require that each annotator annotates each comment interchangeably as the observed variability is due to chance . The ( cid:2009 ) value gotten as a result of the statistical method is
0.624 for the 3 sentiment categories highlighted earlier . This value indicates substantial agreement between annotators as it is close to the recommended tentative reliability value of 0667 3 . THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM The algorithm does a linear combination of the sentiment score of English “ adjectives ” and “ adverbs ” derived from SentiWordNet thesarus [ 1 ] and the sentiment score of Yoruba words derived from our Yoruba sentiment lexicon ( Section 2 ) . We selected English adjectives and adverbs because they are naturally used to express sentiments ( eg very interesting movie ) . Because we need to sum the sentiment scores for English and Yoruba words , we compute the sentiment scores for English and Yoruba words independently . Both scores are then linearly combined to determine the leading sentiment in a comment . Thus , there are two steps involved .
Step 1 : Polarity score for each English word is determined using SentiWordNet . SentiWordNet returns the polarity scores of corresponding synsets for each English word but returns “ null ” for non English words . The polarity scores may be different for each of the synset entries . The absolute polarity scores for all the synset entries ( ie positive , negative , neutral ) is computed as follows :
( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667)1(cid:1863)(cid:3533)(cid:2028)(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3046 ) ( cid:4666)(cid:1857)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:4666)1(cid:4667 ) ( cid:3038 ) where ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 ) is the absolute score for each polarity of the word ( cid:2880 ) w based on the number of synset entries k and ( cid:2028 ) is the SentiWordNet polarity score for each synset entry ( cid:1857 ) . Thus , the ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 ) for “ each ” word would give 3 absolute polarity scores
( cid:4666)(cid:1857)(cid:4667 ) , 1(cid:1863)(cid:3533)(cid:2028)(cid:3032 ) ( cid:3038 ) ( cid:2880 )
1(cid:1863)(cid:3533)(cid:2028)(cid:3032)(cid:3034 ) ( cid:3038 ) ( cid:2880 )
( cid:4666)(cid:1857)(cid:4667 ) , for all its synsets ( ie positive , negative , and neutral ) . A naïve approach to compute the sentiment score for English words is to find and sum the maximum polarity score from each word synset . However , this approach would give a constant polarity score for every word in SentiWordNet since k is constant . This ignores the importance of the different synsets polarity scores and counterintuitive to the overall sentiment distribution in a comment . We compute the sentiment score for all English words as follows :
, ( cid:3425 ) ( cid:4666)2(cid:4667 ) where ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1831)(cid:3030)(cid:4667 ) is the maximum sentiment score for all English words in the comment , ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3046)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 ) , ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3032)(cid:3034)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 ) , ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3032)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 ) are
( cid:3020)(cid:3030)(cid:3042)(cid:3045)(cid:3032 ) ( cid:3421 ) ( cid:3533)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3046)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 )
( cid:2880 ) ,(cid:3533)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3032)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 )
( cid:2880 )
( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1831)(cid:3030)(cid:4667)max ( cid:3533)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3032)(cid:3034)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:4667 )
( cid:2880 ) the absolute sum of positive , negative , and neutral synsets scores respectively .
Step 2 : We use n gram technique to pick words from the comment and compare with words in our Yoruba sentiment lexicon . Because the lexicon also contains Yoruba phrases , the ngram technique seems appropriate for our work . We set our n to 4 as the longest phrase in our lexicon contains 4 words . If our lexicon contains the n gram selection , it returns the polarity score . Like the English words , we compute the absolute polarity scores for Yoruba sentiment words or phrases by summing all positive , negative , and neutral scores if any , otherwise each polarity score is set to “ zero ” . However , we do not consider Yoruba synsets like SentiWordNet as it is beyond the scope of this study . We select the maximum polarity score as the absolute sentiment score for Yoruba words as follows :
( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1851)(cid:3030)(cid:4667 ) max ( cid:3020)(cid:3030)(cid:3042)(cid:3045)(cid:3032 ) ( cid:3421 ) ( cid:3533)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3046)(cid:4666)(cid:1877)(cid:4667 ) ,
( cid:2880 ) ,(cid:3533)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3032)(cid:4666)(cid:1877)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:3533)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3032)(cid:3034)(cid:4666)(cid:1877)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:3425 ) ( cid:4666)3(cid:4667 ) where ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1851)(cid:3030)(cid:4667 ) is the maximum sentiment score for all Yoruba ( cid:2880 ) ( cid:2880 ) words in the comment , ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3043)(cid:3042)(cid:3046)(cid:4666)(cid:1877)(cid:4667 ) , ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3032)(cid:3034)(cid:4666)(cid:1877)(cid:4667 ) , ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3032)(cid:4666)(cid:1877)(cid:4667 ) are 3 satisfying a linear expression ( cid:1829)(cid:2009)(cid:1850)(cid:3397)(cid:2010)(cid:1851 ) . ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1831)(cid:3030)(cid:1851)(cid:3030)(cid:4667)(cid:3080 ) ( cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1831)(cid:3030)(cid:4667)(cid:3397 ) ( cid:3081)(cid:1855)(cid:1867)(cid:1857)(cid:3090)(cid:4666)(cid:1851)(cid:3030)(cid:4667 ) ( 4 ) where ( cid:2009 ) and ( cid:2010 ) are the number of English and Yoruba words in the absolute sum of positive , negative , and neutral polarity scores respectively . Finally , the absolute sentiment score for each comment is computed as the linear combination of equation 2 and each comment respectively . 4 . EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We selected 10,000 comments at random from our dataset and performed experiment with our algorithm and another state of theart algorithm [ 3 ] . We then compared the results of both algorithms in terms of precision and recall . We selected [ 3 ] because it uses only SentiWordNet for multilingual sentiment analysis ( excluding Yoruba ) . Table 2 shows the precision and recall values for both algorithms and Figure 1 shows the precision and recall curves for random 10 comments ( assuming a movie with 10 comments ) .

Table 2 : Precision Recall results Figure1 : Precision Recall curves The purpose of figure 1 is to show distinct difference in performances between the two algorithms at a very minimal level . It is remarkable that our algorithm shows significant performance at both large scale and minimal level . Even if Yoruba language is not resource constrained , we think our algorithm will still perform better because of its ability to account for “ pidgin ” Yoruba words . 5 . CONCLUSION We proposed automatic sentiment analysis algorithm that performs better on YouTube comments on Yoruba movies using SentiWordNet thesaurus and Yoruba sentiment lexicon . We will extend our work to detect Yoruba sentiments from Facebook updates for the purpose of placing contextual advertisements . 6 . REFRENCES [ 1 ] Esuli , A . , Sebastiani , F .
