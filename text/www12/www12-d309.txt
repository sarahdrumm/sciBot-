ABSTRACT Over the last few years , Twitter is increasingly becoming an important source of up to date topics about what is happening in the world . In this paper , we propose a dynamic topic association detection model to discover relations between Twitter topics , by which users can gain insights into richer information about topics of interest . The proposed model utilizes a time constrained method to extract event based spatio temporal topic association , and constructs a dynamic temporal map to represent the obtained result . Experimental results show the improvement of the proposed model compared to static spatio temporal method and co occurrence method .

INTRODUCTION Twitter , as one of the most popular micro blogging services , has already attracted 200 million registered users up to April 29 , 2011 . Fast diffusion of information makes Twitter a convenient platform for users to generate and seek new trends about topics of interest . Generally , a topic may have different related topics at different time . Those dynamic associations among topics are generated from real world events [ 1 ] . For example , ‘Michael Jackson’ always came together with ‘vocal concert’ around Jun 23 , 2009 , but co occurred with ‘funeral’ around Sep 3 , 2009 . By detecting those event based associations among topics , a user can better understand the details of topics he is interested in , such as their development tendency and associated events . Existing study has focused on detecting topic association from text contents by co occurrence method [ 6 ] . This approach is beneficial when the average length of texts is not short . However , it is hard to discover the co occurrence relationship between topics in tweet like short texts . In [ 5 ] , we proposed a spatio temporal model for topic association detection in Twitter , and this model can effectively discover potential correlations among Twitter topics . In this paper , we extend our work in [ 5 ] by proposing a dynamic topic association detection model , for discovering related topics with query topic in its different bursty periods . Well noticed events about a topic can result in message activity bursts for it , and most of those messages in an activity burst describe a common event [ 7 ] . Therefore , we can discover query topic ’s dynamic association with other topics by detecting their co bursting relationship when events occur . In addition , related topics tend to present similar temporal dynamics and location

The proposed model first utilizes a burst detection algorithm to extract burst periods of query topic , then employs a co bursting judgment method to find the potential related topics with it , finally calculates the spatiotemporal similarity between topics to provide user a related topic list . In the following of this article , we will illustrate the details of problem definition and our proposed model , along with the experimental results . 2 . PROBLEM DEFINITION AND METHOD DESCRIPTION 2.1 Problem Definition In this paper , we use the definition of topic as "any subject of interest to a user" [ 3 ] , examples include Lakers , Roberto Baggio , Christmas , etc . A set of posts related a topic k are defined as Pk = {pk1 , pk2,…pkn} , where n means the number of posts . Then we define the gaps in time between posts as Gk = {gk1 , gk2,…gk(n 1)} , where gki means the time interval between pki and pk(i+1 ) . Bursts of a topic are described as ‘grow in intensity for a period of time , and then fade away’ [ 2 ] . We define bursty periods of topic k as Bk = {bk1 , bk2,…bkm} , where bkj means the jth detected burst period of topic k . We further represent a topic k as the following spatiotemporal state series : Topick = {k1 , k2 , … , ki , … , kI , k(I+1 ) , k(I+2 ) , … , k(I+s ) , … , k(I+S)} , where ki ( i∈ [ 1 , I ] ) means the frequency of topic k in the ith time interval , k(I+s ) ( s∈ [ 1 , S ] ) means the numbers of users who have posted tweets about topic k in sth region . Then we can calculate spatio temporal relationships between topics within a fixed period [ 5 ] . Given a query topic and queried time window , our goal is to detect the event based spatio temporal related topics with query topic in its different bursty periods .

2.2 Method Description The framework of the proposed model is shown in Fig 1 . We first detect query topic's burst periods , then discover its co bursting relationship with other topics , which can help find the potential related topics . Finally , we rank topics' associate degree with a spatio temporal similarity computing method . Burst Detection Burst detection is used to discover topics’ event based bursty periods . For an arbitrary topic k , we adopt the

, with formula C i ( ) min ( + l l = and jC 0 burst detection technique proposed in [ 2 ] to obtain Bk from Gk . With the number of bursty intensity states z determined , we can calculate bursty intensity states of all gaps in Gk , which are between 0 and z . Cj(i ) is defined to be the minimum cost of gki C i is chosen to be the state of ending with state j , and argmin Cj(i ) gki . as of The j l f g C i ( , )),(0 ( ( ) 1 ) ln initial ≤ ≤ τ − + j j ki j > . In the above formula , = ∞ for 0 conditions C 0(0 ) ( 0 ) is a function representing the distribution rule of Gk , and f g ( j l jτ ( , is a function of cost incurred by moving from state l to state j . In addition , burst of intensity v is defined to be a maximal interval over which states of index v or higher persist . We define the sequence of those intervals as Bt . Finally , we delete the intervals less than one day , which are unlikely to be real bursty periods , and define Bt’ to save the left intervals . Co bursting Relationship Detection Topics show bursty states when events occurred and we can detect the event based associations between topics by discovering the co bursting relationship of them [ 1 ] , where the co bursting relationship is defined as ‘a burst of the query topic share a common time window with a burst of another topic’ . If ≠ ∅ , where *Ab is an arbitrary bursty period of topic A , and Qib is the ith bursty period of query topic , we define this situation as topic A has a cobursting relationship with query topic in Qib . In this paper , given a query topic , we detect its co bursting topics in each bursty period of it , which we will take as candidate related topics . Spatio temporal Similarity Calculation After representing topics as the spatio temporal state series , we utilize Euclidean distance to measure the spatial similarity SimS and temporal similarity SimT respectively , then use a parameter λ to adjust the significance of temporal similarity and spatial similarity as Sim =λSimT +(1 λ)SimS . Finally , we calculate the integrated spatiotemporal similarities between the query topic and its potential related topics in its different bursty periods , and used the similarities as weights to get the rank list . 3 . EXPERIMENTS 3.1 Dataset and Parameter Settings We use Twitter API to gather tweets data about hot topics in Twitter . We first download hot topics appeared from Dec 4 , 2011 to Dec 10 , 2011 , then track the tweets about those topics from Dec 11 , 2011 to Dec28 , 2011 . The dataset finally consists of 1778 topics with 5843527 tweets . The parameter k in burst detection was set to be 8 with the method described in [ 2 ] , and we set v to be 1 , taking into account our data size . Finally , λ is chosen to be 0.59 after the cyclic iterative method [ 5 ] . 3.2 Results and Discussions We measure the effects of our proposed model using top k precision — the percentage of accurate results in the top k results [ 4 ] . Accordingly , two additional topic association detection methods were conducted as baselines : Static spatio temporal method : like in [ 5 ] , calculating the spatio temporal similarity between topics without the co bursting relationship detection step . Co occurrence method : using the co occurrence method given in [ 6 ] to detect associations between topics . For our experimental evaluation , we have 3 PhD candidates manually label the related topics . Manually examining all the topics in our data set is prohibitively expensive , so we choose 30 topics randomly from our experimental dataset . In each bursty period of the 30 topics , most relevant 5 topics are tagged .

Fig 2 demonstrates the evaluation results , from which we can see our method outperforms the Co occurrence method and Static spatio temporal method . The the integration of co bursting relationship detection . In addition , the two spatio temporal similarity based method perform better than co occurrence method , this result proves the effect of spatiotemporal similarity based method on topic association detection in Twitter like short texts . We further construct a dynamic temporal map to represent the obtained result , which is shown in fig . 3 . We can see a series of topics related to the American country music singer Toby Keith , such as his song ‘Made in America’ , and some other singers who have various relationships with Toby Keith . From this dynamic temporal map , we can conveniently observe the related topic with the query in its different bursty time periods .
