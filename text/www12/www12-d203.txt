ABSTRACT This paper aims to combine the viral marketing with the idea of direct selling to for influence maximization in a social network . In direct selling , producers can sell the products directly to the consumers without having to go through a cascade of wholesalers . Through direct selling , it is possible to sell the products in a more efficient and economic manner . Motivated by this idea , we propose a target selecting independent cascade ( TIC ) model , in which during influence propagation each active node can give up to attempt to influence some neighboring nodes , named victims , who are hard to affect , and try to activate friends of its friends , termed destinations , who could have higher potential to increase the influence spread . The next question to ask is that given a social network and a set of seeds for influence propagation under TIC model , how to effectively select targets ( ie , victims and destinations ) for the attempts of activation during propagation to boost the influence spread . We propose and evaluate three heuristics for the target selection . Experiments show that selecting targets based on influence probability between nodes have the highest boost of influence spread .

INTRODUCTION Social structure plays a key role in the spread of information and influence for targeted marketing . The problem , influence maximization [ 3 ] , is to find a subset of individuals ( as seeds ) such that they can eventually influence the largest number of people ( ie , influence spread is maximized ) in a social network . Some greedy [ 6 ] and heuristic [ 1 ] methods have been proposed . Mathioudakis et al . [ 7 ] simplified the network to boost the time efficiency of finding seeds . Some variations are also proposed to tackle different real world requirements . Leskovec et al . [ 6 ] selected a set of sensors such that their placements can efficiently detect the propagation of information or virus . Lappas et al . [ 4 ] found effectors which can cause an activation pattern very similar to the given active nodes . Li et al . [ 5 ] discovered mediators who control the bottlenecks of influence propagation when seeds want to activate some target nodes . In addition to find diverse roles of nodes under traditional influence propagation models , Cosley et al . [ 2 ] considered the temporal dynamics to devise new sequential propagation models . Yang and Leskovec [ 8 ] proposed new linear influence model for propagations in implicit networks by predicting the newly infected nodes . In this paper , we propose to boost the influence spread under the settings of influence maximization , by integrating the concepts of direct selling into viral marketing . Direct selling is a marketing strategy that sells products or services directly to customers through one to one presentation , party plan , and personal contact arrangements , instead of relying on some mediators such as wholesalers . In direct selling , salespersons are often paid not only for the sales they made , but also for the sales made by people they Copyright is held by the author/owner(s ) .

In real world scenarios , marketers tend to utilize both viral marketing and direct selling together to promote their products . Based on existing influence propagation models ( eg independent cascade and linear threshold models ) which realize the viral marketing , we add the idea of direct selling by imposing a dynamic target selection mechanism with the goal to maximize the influence spread under the new influence propagation model . 2 . DYNAMIC TARGET SELECTION To combine the viral marketing and direct selling , we propose a dynamic target selection mechanism and impose it on an existing influence propagation model . Note that although in this paper we focus on the independent cascade ( IC ) model [ 3 ] , the targetselecting mechanism can easily be applied to other propagation models . We first describe the Target selecting Independent Cascade ( TIC ) model , and then define the problem of influence maximization under TIC model . Target selecting Independent Cascade Model . In the original
IC model , let ( cid:3047 ) be the set of activated nodes at time , each active node ∈(cid:3047 ) has a single chance to activate its inactive neighbors with an influence probability ( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:4667 ) . If succeeds , will become active in round ( cid:3397)1 and be added into ( cid:3047 ) ; otherwise , will not attempt to activate again in the future . The new TIC its incident edges : hiding a subset of links to its neighbor set model is similar to the IC model except for the step of choosing neighboring nodes for activation . The dynamic target selection mechanism is applied when choosing target neighboring nodes . The idea is that rather than attempting to activate all neighbors , we consider some neighbors are negligible because they are either un influential or nearly impossible to be activated . Some neighbors of neighbors , which might be more influential or easier to influence , are more worthwhile to be chosen . This idea corresponds to the intuition of direct selling that sales usually target a few unacquainted friends of friends whose interests are similar to him , in addition to some close friends . The TIC model works as follows . For each active node ∈(cid:3047 ) , we virtually change some of ( cid:1840)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , and adding a set of virtual links to the set of neighbors of neighbors ( cid:1840)(cid:2870)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , ( cid:1840)(cid:2870)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4668)⋃ ( cid:4669)\(cid:4668)(cid:1840)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)∪(cid:4668)(cid:4669)(cid:4669 ) . In other words , the node will select ( cid:1865 ) victim nodes to ignore from ( cid:1840)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) and select ( cid:1865 ) destination nodes from ( cid:1840)(cid:2870)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) to create virtual connections for activation , where ( cid:1865)(cid:2012)(cid:3400)|(cid:1840)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)| , ( cid:2012)∈(cid:4670)0,1(cid:4671 ) is probability ( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:1875)(cid:4667 ) between and each potential destination node ( cid:1875 ) , we compute ( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:1875)(cid:4667 ) using Jaccard coefficient of the labels between and ( cid:1875 ) : ( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:1875)(cid:4667)|(cid:1838)∩(cid:1838)(cid:3050)||(cid:1838)∪(cid:1838)(cid:3050)| , where ( cid:1838 ) is the label set ( eg interests , skills ) associated with node . That says , if and ( cid:1875 ) has more common attributes , will have higher potential to affect ( cid:1875 ) . Problem Definition . Given ( a ) a social network ( cid:1833)(cid:4666)(cid:1848),(cid:1831),(cid:1842)(cid:4667 ) , where ( cid:1848 ) stands for individuals and each undirected edge ( cid:4666),(cid:4667)∈ ( cid:1831 ) is associated with an influence probability ( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:4667)∈(cid:4670)0,1(cid:4671 ) , ( b ) the TIC model , ( c ) a set of ( cid:1863 ) seed nodes , ( d ) the influence the selecting ratio . Since the links virtually added or hidden , the network structure will not be changed . To determine the influence

3 . TARGET SELECTION STRATEGY We discuss three efficient heuristics for target ( victim and destination ) selection , including Degree Discount , Outward Probability and Between Probability , as presented below . Degree Discount is proposed by Chen et al . [ 1 ] , which improves the degree heuristic and nearly approaches the performance of the greedy method . The degree discount heuristic considers that the degree of a node should be discounted by the number of neighbors which have been selected as seeds . We propose to select nodes with few connections to be victims and nodes with more friends to be destinations . For an active node , we find ( cid:1865 ) victims with ( cid:1865)(cid:1861)∈(cid:3015)(cid:3117)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1856)(cid:1856)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) and ( cid:1865 ) destinations with ( cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876)∈(cid:3015)(cid:3118)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1856)(cid:1856)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , where ( cid:1856)(cid:1856)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1856)2(cid:4666)(cid:1856)(cid:4667)(cid:3400)(cid:3400)(cid:1868 ) , where is the number of ’s neighbors which have been activated , and ( cid:1868 ) is the influence probability of the edge between and its neighbor . outward probability as ( cid:1868)(cid:3042)(cid:3047)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4666)∑ ( cid:4667)(cid:4667)/|(cid:1840)(cid:4593)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)| , where ( cid:1840)(cid:4593)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4668)(cid:1876 ) | ( cid:1876)∈(cid:1840)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) and ( cid:1876 ) is inactive(cid:4669 ) . For an active node , we select ( cid:1865 ) victims with ( cid:1865)(cid:1861)∈(cid:3015)(cid:3117)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1868)(cid:3042)(cid:3047)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) and ( cid:1865 ) destinations with ( cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876)∈(cid:3015)(cid:3118)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1868)(cid:3042)(cid:3047)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) .
Outward Probability . An alternative to measure the influence potential of a node is to consider the influence probabilities of its incident edges toward inactive nodes . Thus , we define the average
( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:1875 )
( cid:3050)∈(cid:3015)(cid:4594)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 )
Between Probability . To select victims and destinations , the previous two methods consider the influence abilities of neighboring nodes . However , in real world marketing scenario , one tends to give up the attempts to influence the individuals who are either too hard to activate or can hardly provide benefit to the ultimate goal . Instead , one could turn to promote the products to those prone to be activated . Therefore , we determine the targets to virtually hide and add links based on the difficulty of activation , which is controlled by the influence probability . Specifically , for an active node , we select ( cid:1865 ) victims with ( cid:1865)(cid:1861)∈(cid:3015)(cid:3117)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:4667 ) and ( cid:1865 ) destinations with ( cid:1865)(cid:1853)(cid:1876)∈(cid:3015)(cid:3118)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:4667 ) , where ( cid:1868)(cid:4666),(cid:4667 ) is comput ed by their common attributes , as described in the previous section . 4 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method . We compile the DBLP bibliography data to a coauthorship network containing 22,285 nodes and 49,365 edges in some premier conferences of data mining ( ie , KDD , ICDM , SDM , PAKDD , PKDD , SIGIR , WWW , and CIKM ) . The influence probabilities on edges are determined by the number of coauthorships between two persons . If #coauthor is higher than 100 , the edge weight is 1 ; otherwise , it is set to #coauthor/100 . One will have higher potential to activate its neighbor if they have published more co works . We measure the effectiveness by the
Normalized Boost of Influence Spread ( cid:4666)(cid:3010)(cid:3004)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:3010)(cid:3004)(cid:4666)(cid:4667)(cid:4667)/ ( cid:3010)(cid:3004)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) . We compare the effectiveness of the presented three taroriginal seed nodes ( the number of seeds ( cid:1863 ) is set to be 50 ) are ( selecting ratio ( cid:2012)=0.3 ) , and ( 2 ) presenting the effectiveness by varying the selecting ratio ( cid:2012)=01,02,,06 , and fixing the victim selected using the greedy method [ 3 ] to ensure the quality . The evaluation plan consists of two parts : ( 1 ) testing the performance for the combinations of different target selection methods get selection methods while using a random method as the baseline . The results are derived by averaging 20,000 simulations of influence propagation of the IC and TIC models , in which the the influence spread ( cid:3010)(cid:3004)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) under the original IC model is about selection method as the between probability . The experimental results are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 , respectively . Note that
310 . In Figure 1 , we can find that using the between probability to select victims and destinations outperforms other combinations . In Figure 2 , we find that as the selecting ratio increases , the effects of boosting influence spread become more evident . These results indicates that when allowing direct selling in propagating influence , selecting individuals who are easy to activate is more effective than choosing targets based on their influence potentials .

CONCLUSION This paper proposes to boost the influence spread by devising a dynamic target selection mechanism and imposing it on the independent cascade targetselecting mechanism realizes the idea of direct selling . Experimental results show that selecting victims and destinations can effectively maximize the boost of influence spread . Ongoing work aims at finding seed nodes for influence maximization under TIC model with the investigation of the submodular property . 6 .
