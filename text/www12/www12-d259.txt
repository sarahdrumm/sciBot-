ABSTRACT Knowledge on word meanings and their relations across languages is vital for enabling semantic information technologies : in fact , the ever increasingly multilingual nature of the Web now calls for the development of methods that are both robust and widely applicable for processing textual information in a multitude of languages . In our research , we approach this ambitious task by means of BabelNet , a widecoverage multilingual lexical knowledge base . In this paper we present an Application Programming Interface and a Graphical User Interface which , respectively , allow programmatic access and visual exploration of BabelNet . Our contribution is to provide the research community with easy to use tools for performing multilingual lexical semantic analysis , thereby fostering further research in this direction .

INTRODUCTION
The vast amount of textual content now on the Web opens up new challenges for Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) , especially in terms of developing wide coverage , domainindependent , multilingual applications . In fact , these huge repositories of text contain a great wealth of information , which can be harvested automatically to address the socalled knowledge acquisition bottleneck . Recently Web resources ( including online collaborative efforts such as Wikipedia1 ) have been leveraged for the automatic acquisition of wide coverage multilingual lexical knowledge resources in

These resources , in their turn , make it possible to generate and leverage semantically rich representations based on world and linguistic knowledge that are not only beneficial for complex NLP tasks such as Word Sense Disambiguation ( WSD ) [ 8 , 12 ] , but also enable next generation systems embedding machine readable knowledge within end user applications , such as Machine Translation and Information Retrieval .
Our vision of knowledge rich multilingual NLP requires two fundamental ingredients : first , a wide coverage multilingual lexical knowledge base ; second , a set of tools to query , retrieve and visualize information from this knowledge base in an effective manner . However , to date , there are no integrated resources and tools which are freely available for the research community on a multilingual scale . Previous endeavors are either not freely available ( EuroWordNet [ 16] ) , or are only accessible via a Web interface ( cf . the Multilingual Research Repository [ 1 ] and MENTA [ 2] ) , or provide only ‘raw’ data with no library for programmatic access ( eg WikiNet [ 6] ) . However , the availability of easy to use libraries for efficient information access is known to foster toplevel research – consider , for example , the widespread use of semantic similarity measures in NLP , due in no small measure to the availability of WordNet::Similarity [ 11 ] . Similarly , the availability of user interfaces such as WordNet ’s 2 or Visual Thesaurus3 beneficially enables fast information access and browsing . With this paper we aim to fill this gap in availability of multilingual tools and resources , introducing BabelNetXplorer , a multi tiered contribution consisting of ( a ) the full public release of BabelNet [ 10 ] , a knowledge repository with concept lexicalizations in 6 languages ( Catalan , English , French , German , Italian and Spanish ) ; ( b ) an Application Programming Interface ( API ) to efficiently access both lexicographic ( ie , word senses ) and conceptual ( ie , concepts and semantic relations ) information found in BabelNet ; ( c ) a graphical interface that allows the user to visually browse BabelNet ’s content .
2 . BABELNET
BabelNet [ 10 ] follows the structure of a traditional lexical knowledge base and accordingly consists of a labeled directed graph where nodes represent concepts and named entities , and edges express semantic relations between them . Concepts and relations are harvested from the largest available semantic lexicon of English , ie , WordNet [ 3 ] , and a

Figure 1 : The Babel synset for bank2 n , ie its ‘financial’ sense ( excerpt , formatted for ease of readability ) . institution1 n is a financial wide coverage collaboratively edited encyclopedia , ie , Wikipedia , thus making BabelNet a multilingual ‘encyclopedic dictionary’ which combines lexicographic information with wide coverage encyclopedic knowledge . BabelNet ’s concept inventory consists of all WordNet ’s word senses ( eg , bank2 n)4 and Wikipedia ’s encyclopedic entries ( ie , its pages , such as for instance Bank of America5 ) , while its set of available relations comprises both semantic pointers between WordNet synsets ( bank2 n ) and semantically unspecified relations from Wikipedia ’s hyperlinked text ( Bank of America is related to Recession ) . In addition to this conceptual backbone , BabelNet provides a multilingual lexical dimension . Each of its nodes , called Babel synsets , contains a set of lexicalizations of the concept in different languages , eg , { banken , Bankde , bancait , . . . , bancoes } . Multilingual lexicalizations for all concepts are collected from Wikipedia ’s inter language links ( eg , the English Wikipedia page Bank links to the Italian Banca ) , as well as by filling the translation gaps ( ie , missing translations ) by means of a statistical machine translation system applied to sense tagged data from SemCor [ 5 ] and Wikipedia itself – for instance , most occurrences of bank1 n in SemCor are translated into German as Ufer .

BabelNet dump . Similarly to WordNet , BabelNet can be stored in a plain text file . This file consists of a list of records , each one identifying a single Babel synset and represented in the following format : id region offset sense no sense+ relation no relation+
An excerpt of the entry for the Babel synset containing bank2 n is shown in Figure 1 . The record contains ( a ) the synset ’s id ; ( b ) the region of BabelNet where it lies ( eg , WIKIWN means at the intersection of WordNet and Wikipedia ) ; ( c ) the corresponding ( possibly empty ) WordNet 3.0 synset offset ; ( d ) the number of senses ( ie , sense no ) in all languages and their full listing ( ie , sense+ ) ; ( e ) the number of semantic pointers to other Babel synsets ( ie , relation no ) and their full listing ( ie , relation+ ) . Senses encode information about their source – ie , whether they come from WordNet ( WN ) , Wikipedia pages ( WIKI ) or their redirections ( WIKIRED ) , or are automatic translations ( WNTR / WIKITR ) – and about their language and lemma . In addition , senses are indexed to model intra synset relations of translation across languages , ie , co indexed senses are translations from English to another language ( for instance , bank2 n translates to banca in Italian ) . Finally , semantic relations are encoded using WordNet ’s pointers , and an additional symbol for Wikipedia relations ( r ) , which can also specify the
4We denote WordNet senses with wi w with part of speech p . 5We refer to Wikipedia pages and senses using Small Caps . p the i th sense of a word source of the relation ( eg , FROM_IT means that the relation was harvested from the Italian Wikipedia ) . In the example in Figure 1 , the Babel synset inherits WordNet hypernyms ( @ ) and hyponyms ( ~ ) relations to financial institution1 n ( offset bn:00034537n ) and Home Loan Bank1 n ( bn:00044511n ) , respectively , as well as Wikipedia relations to the synsets of Financial Instrument ( bn:02945246n ) and Ethical banking ( bn:02854884n , from Italian ) .
BabelNet API . Information encoded in the text dump of BabelNet can be effectively accessed and automatically embedded within applications by means of a programmatic access . To this end , we developed a Java API , based on Apache Lucene6 as backend , which indexes the textual dump and includes a variety of methods to access the three main levels of information encoded in BabelNet , namely : ( a ) lexicographic ( information about word senses ) ; ( b ) conceptual ( the semantic network made up of its concepts ) ; ( c ) and multilingual level ( information about word translations ) . Figure 2 shows a usage example of our API , together with its output . The snippet starts by retrieving all the Babel synsets for the English word bank ( line 3 ) . Next , we access different kinds of information for each synset : first , in lines 5–7 we print its id , source ( WordNet , Wikipedia , or both ) , corresponding WordNet offset ( possibly empty ) , and ‘main lemma’ – namely , a compact string representation of the Babel synset consisting of its corresponding WordNet synset in stringified form , or the first non redirection Wikipedia page found in it . Then , we access and print the German word senses of the Babel synsets ( lines 8–10 ) , and finally the synsets they are related to ( lines 11–19 ) . Note that thanks to carefully designed Java classes , we are able to accomplish all of this in about 20 lines of code .
Graphical user interface . We ship the API with a graphical user interface ( GUI ) that allows the user to visually browse the knowledge repository . Snapshots of the GUI are shown in Figure 3 . The GUI has two main visualization modalities . The first ( Figure 3(a ) ) allows the user to input an arbitrary list of words ( top right pane ) and build a semantic graph ( ie , a subgraph of BabelNet containing their senses and paths that connect pairs of senses [ 9] ) . We use a tree layout for visualization , as this allows for intuitive navigation . This visualization strategy , aimed at building semantic networks from an arbitrary set of words , is useful for exploring portions of BabelNet when the words of interest are known a priori ( for instance , when we need to disambiguate words within a sentence ) . However , a user might wish instead to start from a specific word , select one of its senses and then its semantically related concepts . Accordingly , in order to allow a radial exploration of BabelNet , namely depth first search like from a single sense , we designed a second visualization modality ( Figure 3(b) ) . In

Figure 2 : Sample BabelNet API usage ( with output ) . this modality , starting from the node denoting an initial Babel synset , the user can recursively expand it by showing its outgoing edges and semantic relations to other concepts . The user can switch back and forth between the two views at any moment and visualize the selected relations in the context of the semantic graph or the radial network .
GUI : implementation details . To ensure robustness and scalability we make use of Cytoscape Web7 , a state of theart network visualization software [ 13 ] , which we pair with our own Java library to query paths and create semantic graphs with BabelNet . The latter works by pre computing paths connecting any pair of Babel synsets , which are collected by iterating through each synset in turn , and performing a depth first search up to a maximum depth – which we set to 3 , on the basis of experimental evidence from a variety of knowledge base linking and lexical disambiguation tasks [ 9 , 12 ] . Next , these paths are stored and indexed within a Lucene index , which ensures efficient lookups for querying those paths starting and ending in a specific synset . Given a set of words as input , a Java semantic graph factory class searches for their meanings within BabelNet , looks for their connecting paths , and merges such paths within a single graph . Optionally , the paths in the graph can be filtered – eg , it is possible to remove loops , weighted edges below a certain threshold , etc . – and nodes in the final graph can be scored by means of a variety of methods – such as , for instance , their outdegree in the context of the semantic graph

( cf . [ 9] ) . Note that the API and GUI ’s functionality are used in this work together with BabelNet : however , both can also be used in conjunction with other existing lexical knowledge resources , provided they can be wrapped around Java classes which implement interface methods for querying senses , concepts , and their semantic relations . 4 . DEMONSTRATION
In the demonstration we show the two main contributions of this paper : ( 1 ) an API to programmatically access BabelNet ; ( 2 ) the graphical user interface built on top of it .
We first introduce BabelNet and the problem of polysemy in different languages : for this purpose we start with words in arbitrary languages and show the relations between their different senses and translations across languages . The main objective of the session is to illustrate to the audience how to query BabelNet and navigate across its concepts and word senses in different languages . To this end , we make use of simple programs such as the one shown in Figure 2 . While letting the users interactively query BabelNet ’s content , we guide them at the same time through the actual programs , in order to provide a walk through of the API . In parallel , we show how the textual output of the programs is visually represented in the GUI . Using the visualization component , we show the audience how the previous text based navigation can be more easily performed in a graphical environment . Moreover , thanks to the API ’s interfaces which can be applied to different lexical knowledge bases , we use the GUI to show the richness of BabelNet , which is compared side by side with WordNet .

5 . RELATED WORK
Recent work in knowledge base browsing and visualization has concentrated on building semantic graphs to perform Word Sense Disambiguation [ 7 ] , summarization techniques for extracting semantic graphs expressing the most salient relations of an entity with its related concepts [ 15 ] , as well as improving search by means of geographic and temporal information [ 4 ] – which is complementary to similar efforts in browsing document collections [ 14 ] . Our work complements these parallel contributions by means of an integrated platform ( including both API and graphical components ) , which allows the user to query and search programmatically a very large multilingual lexical knowledge base , and to browse it visually . BabelNetXplorer builds upon BabelNet , a multilingual ‘encyclopedic dictionary’ bringing together the lexicographic and encyclopedic knowledge from WordNet and Wikipedia . Other recent efforts on creating multilingual knowledge bases from Wikipedia include WikiNet [ 6 ] and MENTA [ 2 ] : both these resources offer structured information complementary to BabelNet – ie , large amounts of facts about entities ( MENTA ) , and explicit semantic relations harvested from Wikipedia categories ( WikiNet ) – and will be integrated in the future into our API and GUI .
