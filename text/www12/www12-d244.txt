ABSTRACT In this paper we propose a simple and flexible framework to index context annotated documents , eg , documents with timestamps or georeferences , by contextual topics . A contextual topic is a distribution over document features with a particular meaning in the context domain , such as a repetitive event or a geographic phenomenon . Such a framework supports document clustering , labeling , and search , with respect to contextual knowledge contained in the document collection . To realize the framework , we introduce an approach to project documents into a context feature space . Then , dimensionality reduction is used to extract contextual topics in this context feature space . The topics can then be projected back onto the documents . We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a case study on georeferenced Wikipedia articles .

INTRODUCTION
The Web provides a huge source of context annotated documents , like georeferenced and/or timestamped Tweets , Flickr photos , or Wikipedia pages . Recent work used probabilistic topic models to extract geographical topics from Flickr photos [ 1 ] and to explore the geographic distribution of Blog topics [ 2 ] . By that , context annotated document collections have been used to discover meaningful knowledge in the geographic context domain . The motivation of these approaches has mainly been driven by data exploration tasks . However , we believe that contextual topics have a much wider range of applications in contextual search , document labeling , clustering , and query result ( re)ranking .

In this paper , we outline a simple framework to mine contextual topics by projecting the context annotated documents into a context feature space , which is then subject to feature extraction . The extracted topics can then be projected back onto the documents , which we call latent contextual indexing .
Idea : Documents with context annotations can be embedded in the context domain . Then , document features ( eg , terms ) tend to accumulate in subsets of the contextdomain if there is a particular contextual meaning . For example , georeferenced documents containing the term mountain tend to accumulate in subsets of geographic space in which mountains occur .
We show that this simple scheme allows to discover meaningful contextual topics from highly noisy data sources as typical on the Web . 2 . LATENT CONTEXTUAL INDEXING
We assume a context annotated document collection , such as a set of georeferenced text documents . From now on , we assume the context annotations to be points ( locations ) in the geographic domain . We are given the document term matrix A = Nm×p and the document context matrix B = {0 , 1}m×l , with Bij = 1 if document i occurs at location j . Context Feature Space : The locations are embedded in a geographic grid , such that each document falls into the cell(s ) in which it occurs . Hence , the m columns of B can be seen as the set of grid cells . The context feature count matrix C then is defined as
C := BT A = Nl×p
( 1 )
A cell ( row ) of C contains all the features of the documents occurring in this cell . We say a cell ( location ) is represented in context feature space . Feature Extraction : The contextual topics are extracted using dimensionality reduction in the context feature space , for instance using PCA , ICA , or NMF . We generally denote a feature extraction task into k topics as :
˜C = W H , W = Rl×k , H = Rk×p
( 2 )
Then , a contextual topic consists of two distributions : The context topic distribution W , representing the topic weights over cells , and the topic feature distribution H , representing the feature weights over topics . Indexing : Note that the feature extraction happens in context feature space . To project the topics back onto the documents , two projections are possible :
˜AF = AH T

( 3 ) is the feature based projection : A document will have a high topic weight if its features correspond to the topic . ( 4 ) is the context based projection : A document will have a high topic weight if the topic has high weight at the document context annotations .
3 . EXPERIMENTS We conducted experiments on 111 , 166 Wikipedia abstracts occurring within the US ( [−124,−54]×[26 , 50] ) , downloaded from DBpedia 1 . Only terms occurring at least 20 times in the collection have been kept and no stopwords have been removed , resulting in 17 , 266 document features ( terms ) . The context domain is represented by a regular grid with stepwidth 1.0 degree over the US bounds , resulting in a contextfeature count matrix C with 1728 rows ( 72 × 24 grid ) . We normalized C to use only the binary occurrence information of a feature .
The contextual features have been extracted using Independent Component Analysis ( ICA ) , reducing the 17 , 266 dimensional space to 10 dimensions . Figure 1 shows the geographic distribution of three selected topics , and Figure 2 shows those topics by their 10 highest weighted terms . Topic 1 clearly represents the mountains in the US , and Topic 2 the coastal regions . Topic 3 can be seen as a topic related to historic places , with high intensity in the east . We note that other meaningful topics are the major cities , the Canadian border , and California . Also a single non geographic topic exists whose geographic distribution just follows the distribution of the document locations ( not presented here ) . Those extracted topics can be projected back onto the documents using equations ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . Figure 3 shows the top 8 Wikipedia articles regarding the feature based indexing weights ( left three value columns ) . The context based indexing weights are also shown ( right three value columns ) . The top ranked Wikipedia articles for the three topics show meaningful results . Interestingly , not all articles have high feature based and context based topic weights ( bold names ) . Articles like Schofield Pass Nevada have a high weight for the mountain topic regarding its terms . However , the article is not located in a cell with a high weight for that topic . Such differences give interesting opportunities to explore , search , and cluster the articles according to term or context based preferences . In general , the results show that the context feature space of annotated document collections ( like Wikipedia abstracts ) contains meaningful knowledge about the context domain .

4 . CONCLUSIONS
We proposed a simple approach to index documents by contextual topics and conducted experiments using a collection of georeferenced Wikipedia articles . The projection of documents into a context feature space provides a rich framework . It allows for normalization , smoothing , and resolution settings . Here , we showed initial results using a simple geographic grid and ICA , which gives promising results . Currently we evaluate parameterizations and feature extraction approaches on various data sets , and work on applications of latent contextual indexing in the domain of search and recommendation .
