ABSTRACT Over the Internet or on social networks rumors can spread and can affect the society in disaster . The question one asks about this phenomenon is that whether these rumors can be suppressed using suitable mechanisms . One of the possible solutions is to inoculate a certain fraction of nodes against rumors . The inoculation can be done randomly or in targeted fashion . In this paper , small world network model has been used to investigate the efficiency of inoculation . It has been found that if average degree of small world network is small than both inoculation methods are successful . When average degree is large , neither of these methods are able to stop rumor spreading . But if acceptability of rumor is reduced along with inoculation , the rumor spreading can be stopped even in this case.The proposed hypothesis has been verified using simulation experiments .

INTRODUCTION
When a disaster occurred , people try to acquire information through social web . Sometimes , social web information is useful , so people can get valuable knowledge . On the other hand , social web information is occasionally unreliable . Harmful rumors spread and cause people to panic . In today ’s information oriented society , a mechanism to suppress harmful rumors in social web has become very important .
In last decade many complex network models eg ER model , small world network model , scale free network model have been introduced [ 1 , 8 ] . Work has also been done on epidemic spreading in complex networks [ 4 , 5 , 7 ] . Some kind of networks , where most nodes have similar degrees , ie , the

In contrary to homogeneous networks , the networks with large fluctuations in degree distributions are called heterogeneous networks , eg scale free networks [ 14 ] .
The rumor spreading can be seen as epidemic spreading . Work on epidemic spreading has been done by many researchers [ 5 , 7 ] . In these epidemic spreading , epidemic inoculation is attractive . Pastor Satorras and Vespignani [ 9 ] found that random inoculation was not efficient for all complex networks like in scale free networks . Therefore , targeted inoculation scheme was found to be successful inoculation for scale free networks . An standard model of rumor spreading , was introduced by Daley and Kendal [ 2 ] and its variants such as Maki Thomsan [ 6 ] . In Daley Kendal(DK ) population is subdivided into three groups : ignorant , spreaders and stiflers . The rumor is propagated through the population by pairwise contacts between spreaders and other individuals in the population . Any spreader involved in a pairwise meeting attempts to infect other individual with the rumor . In Maki Thomsan ( MK ) model when spreader contacts another spreader only initiating spreader becomes a stifler . DK and MK model have an important shortcoming is that it do not take into account the topology of the underlying social interconnection networks along which rumors spread . To consider the topology of network , rumor model on small world network [ 6 , 11 , 12 ] and scale free networks [ 3 ] have been defined . Using mean field theory Nekovee , et al . [ 6 ] discovered that threshold ( below which a rumor can not be spread ) was small in homogeneous networks . Few studies have been done to stop rumor spreading . These studies are more important since false and fatal rumors have negative impacts on the society in disaster .
This paper proposes a framework to suppress the harmful rumors over social web by using small world network model . Watts Strogatz(WS ) model for small world network [ 10 ] integrates the features of regular and random graphs together . They can be created by starting with some regular graphs ( eg a lattice ring ) and randomly “ rewiring ” a given fraction , P , of edges as described by Watts and Strogatz .
2 . PROPOSED RUMOR SPREADING MODEL
Nekovee , et al .
[ 6 ] gave a general stochastic model for In this model , the total population the rumor spreading . is divided into three compartments : ignorant individuals , spreaders and stiflers . Ignorant populations are susceptible to being informed , spreaders spread the rumor and stiflers
WWW 2012 – SWDM'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France675 know the rumor but they are not interested in spreading it . In this paper , stiflers have been further divided into two compartments : one population of stiflers who accept the rumor but not interested in spreading it , other ones related to population who reject the rumor ( not interested in accepting ) , they can be considered as inoculated population as in epidemic spreading model . There are N nodes and each node can be in one of the compartments of ignorant , spreaders and stiflers . When a spreader meets with an ignorant node , ignorant node becomes a spreader with rate λ,or a stifler who accepts the rumor with rate α , or a stifler who rejects the rumor with rate δ . When a spreader meets with a spreader or stifler , the spreader becomes a stifler who accepts the rumor with rate γ . The quality of this model is that it allows ignorant nodes to become stifler when it is contacted by a spreader.This is similar to real life where a person may not spread rumor when he or she hears it from an other person . Here 1/δ can be considered as acceptability of rumor . If we increase δ , ignorant nodes are more likely to become stiflers who do not accept the rumor . If for a rumor δ is small , the rumor has more acceptable information . In this paper I(t ) , S(t ) , Racc(t ) , Rrej(t ) represent the fraction of ignorant nodes , spreaders , stiflers who accept the rumor and stiflers who rejects the rumor respectively , as the function of time t . R(t ) is the total number of stiflers ( who accept and reject rumor ) at time t . Above rumor spreading process can be summarized by following set of pairwise interaction .

I(t ) + S(t ) + Racc(t ) + Rrej(t ) = 1 , I + S λ−→ 2S , I + S δ−→ Rrej + S , I + S α−→ Racc + S , γ−→ 2Racc , S + Racc γ−→ Racc + Rrej ,
S + Rrej

γ−→ Racc + S .
Following the mean field rate equations given in [ 6 ] , we define mean field rate equations for our model as = −(λ + α + δ)fik'I(t)S(t ) , = λfik'I(t)S(t ) − γfik'S(t)(S(t ) + Racc(t ) + dS(t ) dI(t ) dt dt

( 3 ) where , fik' is the average degree of the WS network and initial conditions of above equations are I(0 ) ≈ 1 , S(0 ) ≈ 0 , Racc(0 ) = 0 , Rrej ( 0 ) = 0 . In equation ( 2 ) , λ + α + δ ≤ 1 . By using equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , one get the following transcendental equation ( Appendix A ) , γ R(∞ )
R(∞ ) = 1 − e

From equation ( 6 ) it is evident that if we increase δ ( decrease the acceptability ) and fix other parameters , Racc(∞ ) will decrease . Thus , if we decrease the acceptability of the rumor , density of populations who accept the rumor will also decrease .
3 . RANDOM INOCULATION ON SMALL
WORLD NETWORK
A Random inoculation strategy inoculates a fraction of the nodes randomly , using no knowledge of the network . g defines the fraction of inoculative nodes . In mean field level , in case of uniform inoculation , the initial conditions of equation ( 2 ) will be modified as : I(0 ) ≈ 1−g , S(0 ) ≈ 0 , Racc(0 ) = 0 , Rrej(0 ) = g . Solving the equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) under these initial conditions , following transcendental equation ( Appendix A ) is obtained .
R(∞ ) = 1 − ( 1 − g)e

Therefore , we will be able to get the critical inoculation λ+γ . When , g > gc , R(∞ ) = g , is only value of g , gc = λ the nonzero solution of equation ( 7 ) . Therefore , Racc(∞ ) = R(∞)−Rrej(∞ ) = R(∞)−g ≡ 0 . This model shows that , by using random inoculation the density of stiflers who accept the rumor can be brought down to zero . The above analysis can be validated by numerical simulations on WS model . Let N=10,000 , fik' = 4 and rewiring probability ( P )=08 Set the other parameters as , λ = 0.25 , α = 0 , δ = 0 and γ = 025 These simulations are performed for 100 different initial configurations of proposed rumor models on at least 10 different realizations of WS model . Results are shown in Figure ( 2 ) , it can be analyzed that if

λ+γ = 0.5 considered . density of inoculation g increases , the density of stiflers who accept the rumor decreases monotonically . Critical inoculation gc is approx 0.5 in Figure ( 2 ) , which is in the agreement of the calculated value of gc = λ By given this analysis it can be seen that critical inoculation gc does not depends on fik' = 4 of homogeneous networks . If our mean field equations can correctly describe in proposed rumor model , it should satisfy 0 ≤ ( λ + α + δ)fik'S(t ) ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ γfik'(S(t ) + Racc(t ) + Rrej ( t ) ) ≤ 1 [ 2 ] , when fik' is too large , these constraints will fail . Therefore , solution to calculate gc needs to be re investigated . We will again perform numerical simulation on WS model with parameters as previous and varying the value of δ , 0 ≤ δ ≤ 075 The results are plotted in Figure ( 3 ) . It has been observed from Figure ( 3 ) that when λ = 0.25 , α = 0 , δ = 0 , γ = 0.25 , analysis to calculate gc will fail . The obtained gc is approx 0.85 which is much higher than the previous obtained value 0.5 for δ = 0 . If mean field rate equations are valid , then constraint 0 ≤ γfik'(S(t)+Racc(t)+Rrej(t ) ) ≤ 1 should be satisfied , when γ = 0.25 , fik' = 12 and S(0 ) + Racc(0 ) + Rrej ( 0 ) = gc = 0.5 but γfik'(S(0 ) + Racc(0 ) + Rrej(0 ) ) = 1.5 > 1 . Therefore mean field rate equation will not be accurate when fik' is large and random inoculation is no longer efficient . The problem can be solved by increasing the parameter δ ( decrease the acceptability of rumor ) and apply random inoculation method at same time . In Figure ( 3 ) , when δ = 0.75 and g=0.55 , Racc(∞ ) near to zero , which means that the given model can be effective by increasing the value of δ .

4 . TARGETED INOCULATION ON SMALL
WORLD NETWORK
To spread of epidemics on heterogeneous networks like scale free , targeted inoculation were introduced . If we have information about all degrees , we may rank nodes by degree , and use targeted inoculation to inoculate nodes by descending degree . When a high degree node is inoculated , the effective degree of its neighbors drops . This inoculation strategy is more effective on heterogeneous networks eg scale free networks . For numerical simulation for targeted inoculation,in WS model by using same parameters we will get results in Figure ( 4 ) . It can be analyzed for the Figure ( 4 )

Here gc is approx 0.25 and rumor spreading is almost zero . The degree distribution in WS model is Poisson degree distribution , which is not strictly homogeneous and possesses some heterogeneous property is there . If a small world network has strictly homogeneous than random inoculation will be equivalent to targeted inoculation . When fik' is high again , simulate the result on WS model with fik' = 12 fix all parameters as previous and vary δ . In Figure ( 5 ) we can visualize that when fik' is large , targeted inoculation is not effective . By increasing the parameter δ with targeted inoculation , rumor spreading can be suppressed .

5 . CONCLUSION
In this paper a new compartment of nodes as stiflers who rejects the rumor with rate δ is added . In real it is possible that one ignorant node with the meeting of spreader node can directly loose the interest to spread the rumor with or without accepting it . It have been shown that proposed model supports the small critical inoculation value gc in random and targeted inoculation to control rumor spreading when fik' of small world network is small . It is also found in targeted inoculation that gc is smaller than random inoculation when fik' is small , even when the distribution conductivities over small world networks is relatively uniform . When fik' is very high , mean field approximation fails . In this case alone random or targeted inoculation will not be effective . Therefore , one should decrease the acceptability of the rumor and apply on the random or targeted inoculation method simultaneously . After doing this we got a small value of gc to control rumor spreading , which was very high in the case of high acceptability ( δ = 0 ) . Hence , in the presented method there is no need to inoculate large number of nodes .
