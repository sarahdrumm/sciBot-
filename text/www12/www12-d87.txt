ABSTRACT Researchers and social observers have both believed that hashtags , as a new type of organizational objects of information , play a dual role in online microblogging communities ( eg , Twitter ) . On one hand , a hashtag serves as a bookmark of content , which links tweets with similar topics ; on the other hand , a hashtag serves as the symbol of a community membership , which bridges a virtual community of users . Are the real users aware of this dual role of hashtags ? Is the dual role affecting their behavior of adopting a hashtag ? Is hashtag adoption predictable ? We take the initiative to investigate and quantify the effects of the dual role on hashtag adoption . We propose comprehensive measures to quantify the major factors of how a user selects content tags as well as joins communities . Experiments using large scale Twitter datasets prove the effectiveness of the dual role , where both the content measures and the community measures significantly correlate to hashtag adoption on Twitter . With these measures as features , a machine learning model can effectively predict the future adoption of hashtags that a user has never used before .

INTRODUCTION
Recently , microblogging sites such as Twitter have rapidly grown from yet another social networking service into one of the most prevalent type of social media . According to a recent statistic [ 36 ] , Twitter has accumulated over 200 million users as well as hundreds of billions of short messages ( ie , tweets ) . Due to the convenience of posting short messages , thousands of tweets are posted every second and from every corner of the world , assembling the “ SMS of the internet ” [ 9 ] and the collection of “ global conversations ” [ 13 ] .
The overwhelming volume of tweets and the tremendously sparse information in each individual tweet have made it

Figure 1 : Snapshots of search results of hashtags extremely difficult for a user to find and track interesting topics . Hashtag , as a brand new organizational object of information , has emerged from this context and soon become widely adopted by Twitter users to facilitate their navigation in this deluge of information . Figure 1 presents two examples of hashtags and the results of searching the two hashtags in Twitter . As simple as a user composed keyword starting with the # symbol , a hashtag effectively coordinates relevant tweets and people in the microblogging media .
The use of hashtags has brought convenience to Twitter users in various ways . As a user defined index term of content , a hashtag links relevant topics and events together [ 8 ] , making it much easier to assess the semantics of a tweet . As a result , the exposure of tweets containing certain hashtags are maximized in information retrieval and navigation . For example , tweets related to iPhone are easily retrieved by a single click on the hashtag #iphone ( see the left panel of Figure 1 ( a) ) . To this end , a hashtag plays the role of a social bookmark : annotating the content , being shared to other users , and assembling the folksonomy .
Is this the only role of a hashtag ? Sociologists , media observers , and computer scientists have all noticed another role . Beyond a bookmark of content , a hashtag serves as the symbol of a community [ 34 , 11 , 12 , 28 ] . Indeed , a hashtag enables users to identify and participate in online chats designated by the tag [ 34 ] . Birds of a feather can be easily found and connected by tracking a particular hashtag , as shown in the right panel of Figure 1 . To this end , a hashtag defines a virtual community of users with the same background ( eg , “ #Umich ” ) , the same interest ( eg , “ #iPhone ” ) , or involved in the same conversation or task ( eg , “ #www2012 ” , “ #VoteForObama ” ) . A user joins such a community by simply including that hashtag in her own tweets .
The observations above have clearly indicated a critical hypothesis that when posting a hashtag , the Twitter users are aware of the dual role it plays – as a unique indicator of both the topic of the content and the membership of a community [ 25 , 15 ] . In other words , by creating a hashtag , a user either invents and shares a new bookmark ( of content ) , or initializes and spreads a coat of arm ( of a community ) , or both . By adopting an existing hashtag , a user either presents her interest in a topic , or presents her intent to obtain a community membership , or both . Should this hypothesis hold , one would expect the analysis of hashtags contribute significantly to the understanding of user interests and behaviors in microblogging sites .
Interestingly , even before being formally tested , this hypothesis has already been directly or indirectly leveraged in various studies of microblogging . Indeed , in existing literature , hashtags have been effectively utilized as critical features for various tasks of text or social network analysis , including topic detection and tracking [ 3 ] , text classification [ 30 ] , community identification [ 24 ] , and link prediction [ 35 ] , etc . On one hand , hashtags do perform effectively in most of these tasks as a specific type of features . On the other hand , because of the lack of a formal conclusion on the role of hashtags , it is difficult to explain why the involvement of hashtags works in some tasks but not in others . There ’s little insight on how to make the best use of hashtags .
In this work , we take the initiative to conduct a systematic empirical analysis of how the dual role of a hashtag affects hashtag adoption . Our goal is to formally test whether the content role and the community role affect users’ behavior of adopting hashtags that they have never used before . To achieve this , we focus on how hashtags are adopted and used by Twitter users , and investigate whether this behavior can be explained as the behavior of bookmarking the content and/or the behavior of joining a community . Should the hypothesis hold , the following observation would be expected : 1 ) the major factors that affect the behavior of content tagging and joining communities will also significantly affect the adoption of hashtags ; and 2 ) by carefully measuring the magnitude of these factors , it is feasible to make predictions of future adoption of hashtags .
The contribution of our work is not to investigate how to utilize hashtags to enhance particular data mining tasks . Instead , our study provides a foundation of the rationality of using hashtags in these tasks : why it works ; and in what context it might work better . Accordingly , our goal is not to differentiate the role of an individual hashtag , but to provide a macroscopical analysis of the two roles . The predictive analysis in our work also serves as a feasibility study of hashtag recommendation , which provides insights to the future construction of recommender systems of hashtags .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . We start with a discussion of related work in Section 2 . In Section 3 we introduce comprehensive measures to quantify the major factors of content tagging and joining communities , followed by a demonstrative analysis of how these measures correlate with the hashtag usage ( Section 4 ) . A formal regression analysis is presented in Section 5 to test the predictive power of these measures to the adoption of hashtags . In Section 6 , we develop machine learning methods to predict the future adoption of hashtags of individual users , which serves as a feasibility study of hashtag recommendation . We conclude our work in Section 7 .
2 . RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first formal analysis to test the predictive power of the dual role of hashtags on hashtag adoption . Between the two roles , the role of content tagging has connected hashtags to existing social tagging systems such as delicious 1 and Flickr 2 . Those tags are also generated by the users to annotate content such as Web pages or photos and are being shared to other users .
The second role as the symbol of a community membership , on the other hand , has differentiated hashtags from traditional social tags . Playing this role , hashtags are employed as a mechanism to participate in online conversations [ 19 ] and join virtual communities [ 34 , 12 ] . This role has been carefully examined in individual events such as scientific conferences [ 22 , 11 ] . Letierce et al . [ 22 ] concluded that annotating messages by hashtags reveals a strong desire from the users to join in the discussion related to the conference . Ebner et al . [ 11 ] argued that conference communities in Twitter are built based on the adoption of one specific hashtag . Therefore , a hashtag is not only a tag of content but also the tag of a community . The community role of a hashtag presents in its functionalities to identify a community , form a community , and allow users to join a community a role never played by traditional social tags . In general , social tags ( such as those in delicious , CiteULike , Flickr , Last.fm and YouTube ) serve for two purposes [ 25 , 15 ] : i ) organizational , to facilitate description or navigation , and ii ) social , to facilitate resource exposure and sharing . This is quite different from the user ’s intent of joining a community , which presents the community role of a hashtag . Because of the conversation nature of Twitter , the social interactions in Twitter communities are far more frequent than those in other social media . In other words , a Twitter community started by hashtags has much richer inner community communications , compared to a flat set of people who happen to use the same bookmark .
Our measurement of the factors of content tagging or joining communities has largely benefited from existing literature . The factors affecting content tagging are inspired from the studies of traditional content tagging systems [ 25 , 15 ] , especially tag recommender systems [ 20 , 14 ] . The factors of joining communities are inspired from the literature of social network analysis , in which this is modeled as a cascading behavior [ 1 , 10 ] , or the adoption of innovation [ 32 , 5 ] .
The predication analysis in our work is in general related to the prediction of user behavior in online communities [ 33 , 18 , 17 , 23 ] . Sen et al . [ 33 ] mentioned that tag selection in MovieLens is affected by community influence and evolving personal tendency such as preferences and beliefs about the tags they apply . Heymann et al . [ 18 ] predicted tag usage in Delicious based on page text , anchor text , surrounding hosts , and other tags for URLs . Hecht et al . [ 17 ] predicted location information through users’ tweets .
Finally , our work is also related to the recommender systems in microblogging communities , including the recommendation of followee [ 16 ] , content [ 7 ] and conversations [ 6 ] in Twitter . Our work presents a feasibility study of hashtag recommendation , instead of aiming at constructing a particular recommender system .

3 . THE PROBLEM AND MEASURES
Our fundamental hypothesis is that a hashtag plays the dual role of both the signature of the content and the symbol of a community membership . Should it hold , the user ’s behavior of adopting a hashtag would be interpreted as either the behavior of bookmarking a content , or the behavior of adopting a community membership , or both . In this section , we present comprehensive measures to quantify the major factors of tag selection and joining communities .
3.1 Basic Notations
We focus on the behavior of a Twitter user u to post a hashtag h at time t in one of his tweets d , which is a short document with a limit of 140 characters . Adopting the common practice in information retrieval , we represent a tweet as a bag of words , ie , d = {w1 , , wN } . We denote D as a large collection of tweets , U as a set of twitter users , and H as a set of hashtags .
Multiple types of relationships exist between Twitter users : a user u can follow another user v , become a friend ( ie , followee ) of v , or mention v in one of his own tweets , or quote and redistribute one of v ’s tweets by retweeting it . In our task , we particularly focus on the retweeting relationship . Rather than the following followee relationships , a retweeting relationship is a much stronger indicator of social influence , which is a major driving force of cascading behavior in online communities [ 10 ] . Indeed , it has been proved in literature that while the number of followers sheerly represents a user ’s popularity , the following relationship reveals little about the social influence of a user [ 4 ] . In contrast , the retweeting relationship , akin to the practice of forwarding interesting blog posts and links via email , can be understood as a form of adoption of innovation and diffusion of information , and reveals salient aspects determining the influence [ 4 ] .
Networks of users can be constructed according to a specific type of relationship . For example , a retweet network of users can be defined as a directed graph Grt = ( V , E ) , where every vertex u ∈ V denotes a Twitter user and every directed edge ( u , v ) ∈ E denotes that the user v has retweeted at least one tweet of the user u . The direction of the edge ( ie , u → v ) corresponds to the direction of information diffusion . An edge can be further weighted by rtu,v , the number of times that u was retweeted by v . The larger rtu,v is , the more frequently v has been influenced by u .
For a user u , we then denote the set of users he has retweeted as Iu , corresponding to the in links of u in Grt . The set of users who have retweeted u is denoted as Ou , corresponding to the out links of u . Clearly , the behavior of users in Iu can directly influence the behavior of u , while the behavior of u can directly influence users in Ou .
Definition 1 : Hashtag Adoption .
We define a hashtag h as used by a user u if it appears in one of her tweets . We call a hashtag usage an “ adoption ” if an existing hashtag h is for the first time used by a user u in her tweet d . Thus we exclude the scenario that h is invented by u . The adoption is spontaneous if the tweet d is composed by the user herself instead of by retweeting others .
The adoption of hashtags is the user behavior we focus on in this study . Given a time stamped collection of tweets D , a set of users U , and a retweeting network Grt , we now present formal measures to quantify the major factors of selecting a content tag and adopting a community membership .
3.2 Measures Related to Content Tagging
We start with the role of a hashtag as an indicator of content . A user uses a hashtag to characterize his interest , to annotate the topic of a tweet , and to share the content to his peers . To this end the adoption of a hashtag is similar to the adoption of a bookmark in Delicious , or a tag in Flickr , or a user selected keyword in weblogs . What factors affect the user ’s selection of such a content tag ? How can they be measured ? Clues can be found from literature , especially from those about recommender systems of tags [ 14 ] .
To summarize , a tag recommender system usually filters tags by optimizing a number of objectives , closely corresponding to the major factors of how a user selects a tag . These factors include : 1 ) the popularity of the tag ; 2 ) the relevance to the content ; and 3 ) the closeness to the user ’s personal preference . While the popularity of a tag is easy to measure , the relevance objective is usually modeled by information retrieval methods such as adaptive filtering [ 2 ] . The preference objective , on the other hand , is usually optimized using collaborative filtering techniques ( eg , [ 31] ) .
Largely inspired by this body of existing literature , we discuss how to measure the two corresponding characteristics of a hashtag : the magnitude of relevance to the content and the closeness to the user preference .
Relevance
We first measure the relevance between a hashtag and the content it annotates . It is worth giving attention that there are two different scenarios in tag recommendation . In some cases when the document to be annotated is known ( eg , suggesting bookmarks for a particular web page ) , the relevance is measured between the tag and the document . In more other cases , the recommendation is made independent to a particular document ( eg , suggesting tags on the frontpage of Delicious ) . In such cases , the relevance is judged between the tag and a dynamic profile of the user . The user profile is usually constructed by accumulating all historical content generated or consumed by the user . Such a method is known as adaptive filtering in information retrieval [ 2 ] . Note that the extremely sparse information in the tag string is usually ineffective in the assessment of relevance . It is common practice to construct and use a rich representation of a tag based the context all documents it annotated .
In our task , we adopt the intuition of adaptive filtering by measuring the “ user level ” relevance instead of a “ tweetlevel ” relevance . This is not only because a tweet is extremely short , but also because we care about whether a user will adopt a hashtag sometime in the future , instead of whether she will adopt a hashtag in a particular tweet . This leads to the following family of measures :
Definition 2 : Relevance Measures .
The relevance between a hashtag h and a user u is measured by a similarity function of two profiles , sim(Dh , Du ) , where the hashtag profile Dh integrates all tweets containing h and the user profile Du consists of all tweets posted by u up to a given time point .
Preference
We then measure how close a hashtag is tied to the per sonal preference of a user . Such a personalized preference plays a critical role in tag recommender systems [ 14 ] . Among all the tags relevant to the content , a user usually prefers the ones she has used before , or the ones that are similar to those she has used . In the problem of hashtag adoption , we are interested in hashtags that have not been used by the user . tivity of a community is either correlated to the popularity of the hashtag , or can be interpreted as a form of indirect social influence , where the community members propagate their influence through the inner community links . We focus on two essential factors of the adoption of community membership : prestige and influence .
Definition 3 : Preference Measures .
Prestige
The degree to which a hashtag h is close to the personal preference of u is measured by an aggregate function f ( · ) of the similarity between h and all hashtags ever used by u . Let Hu be the set of hashtags u has ever used up to a given time point , a preference measure takes the form of f ( {sim(h , h′)|h′ ∈ Hu} ) .
Note that the similarity between two hashtags is computed based on a richer profile of two hashtags instead of the tag string . The profile is constructed using either all the tweets h appeared in , Dh , or all users who have used h , Uh . Any reasonable aggregate function f ( · ) introduces an instantiation of the preference measure , such as the maximum , minimum , sum , or a weighed average .
It is worth mentioning that while the relevance measure reflects the intuition behind many content filtering services [ 2 ] , the preference measures reflect the intuition behind a common approach to collaborative filtering to first establish the similarity among items , and then recommend items that are similar to the items already rated by the user [ 31 ] . Please also note that both the relevance and the preference are time variant , as both the semantics of a hashtag and the personal interest/preference of a user change fast over time .
3.3 Measures Related to Joining Community Hashtags also play a relatively implicit role as the symbol of a community membership . While a user can also use traditional types of social tags such as Flickr tags to find people with similar interests , a community clearly differs from a flat set of people by the rich interconnections among the members . Indeed , we calculated the average level of interactions within a “ hashtag community , ” based on the number of retweets , replies , and mentions between community members . The level of interaction is significantly higher than among random users . Based on our computation , the network density of hashtag communities is around a thousand times larger than the network density among users using the same tag in Flickr , LiveJournal , or YouTube .
To this end , the user behavior of adopting a hashtag can be interpreted as the adoption of a community membership ( ie , to join a community ) . In social network analysis , the behavior of joining a community is usually treated as an instantiation of information diffusion or cascading behavior [ 10 , 1 ] , similar to the adoption of innovation [ 32 , 5 ] . By adopting the membership of a community , the newcomer adopts the norm of the community .
Our second task is to quantify the major factors that affect the behavior of joining communities . We extract a summary of several factors from the literature investigating the adoption of community membership : 1 ) how large the community is ; 2 ) how prestigious the community members are ; 3 ) how much the user is influenced by his friends already in the community ; and 4 ) how actively the community members interact . Apparently , the size of a “ hashtag community ” is highly correlated to the popularity of the hashtag . The ac
We start with the measurement of the prestige of community members designated by a hashtag . To do this , we first propose a way to measure the prestige of individual users . The measurement of prestige is a classical problem in social network analysis , leading to many possible instantiations [ 10 , 27 ] . Intuitively , if a user is followed/retweeted by many users , she appears to be more prestigious ; she appears to be even more prestigious if her followers are prestigious . In this work , we adopt the PageRank score [ 29 ] , which has been proven to be a robust measure of prestige . Similar to the context of ranking Web pages or scientific papers , PageRank of Twitter users can be computed based on either the following/followee graph or the retweet graph . We believe the retweet network is a better choice because retweeting implies an endorsement of another user ’s content , similar to linking to a Web page or citing a scientific article .
Definition 4 : Prestige Measures .
Let Uh be a hashtag community , essentially a set of users who have used the hashtag h . The prestige of a hashtag community is measured by the result of an aggregate function of the prestige score of each existing member of the hashtag community , f ( {pu|u ∈ Uh} ) . pu is realized as the PageRank score of the vertex u in the retweet network Grt . Once again , any reasonable aggregate function f ( · ) introduces an instantiation of the prestige measure .
Influence
We then propose measures for the social influence , also known as the “ neighborhood effect . ” If many of my friends have adopted an innovation , or have joined a community , so will I [ 1 ] . To measure this effect , a critical issue is how to identify the “ neighborhood , ” or the people who have an influence on the behavior of the user . Once again , we prefer to utilize the retweeting relationship instead of the following/followee relations . This is because a retweeting behavior provides a much stronger indication of cascading behavior and social influence .
We quantify the social influence of a hashtag community on a user by aggregating the influence of its individual members on that user . Different realizations of individual influence define different instantiations of the influence measure .
Definition 5 : Influence Measures .
Let Uh be a hashtag community , essentially the set of users who have used hashtag h . The magnitude of influence Uh has on a user u is defined as a function of the influence of individual users v ∈ Uh on user u given the retweet network structure Grt , g({s(v , u)|v ∈ Uh} , Grt ) . The strength of influence of a single user v on u , s(v , u ) , is either realized as a constant if v ∈ Iu and zero otherwise , or proportional to the prestige of v , or proportional to the frequency that u has retweeted v ’s tweets , rtv,u ( as a surrogate of the frequency that v has influenced u before ) , etc .
The function g(· ) can be realized as any reasonable aggregate function of all the individual influences s(v , u ) . In this case , the inference measure excludes the effect of the community members who are not u ’s direct in neighbors . A more general realization of g(· ) propagates the influence of each community member through her out neighbors to the whole retweet network . In other words , the influence of a particular user and a community of users is now “ smoothed ” on the retweet network Grt . Such a measure also reflects the inner connectivity of a hashtag community .
Like relevance and preference , prestige and influence measures are also time variant because the retweeting behaviors change frequently over time . 3.4 Other Measures
Our discussion has been focused on factors of tagging content and joining communities , namely relevance , preference , prestige , and influence . Each of the four factors can be instantiated as a family of various measures , according to the particular selection of functions . Beside these four , we are aware of many other potential factors of hashtag adoption . They characterize either the property of the hashtag ( eg , the popularity of the hashtag ) , or the user ( eg , whether she has been actively posting ) , or the community defined by the hashtag ( eg , the size of the community ) . In fact , some of these factors , such as the popularity of hashtag and the size of the hashtag community , are highly correlated ( with a correlation higher than 09 ) Not surprisingly , the number of people adopting a hashtag is highly correlated to the number of times the hashtag is used .
Factors like these may be highly correlated to the behavior of hashtag adoption . The pure analysis of only these factors , however , will not directly help us identify the two roles of the hashtag . They are either correlated with both roles , or neither of them . Nevertheless , these factors should still be included in our analysis , in order to comprehensively understand the effect of the content specific and communityspecific factors in the context of hashtag adoption . Below we present a broader range of measures that are likely to predict the adoption of hashtags but not relevant to testing the dual role :
Popularity : the number of times a hashtag has been posted ; or the number of users who adopted the hashtag .
Length : the number of characters in the hashtag string . Freshness : the age of a hashtag , or the length of period since its first burst .
Degree : the number of people a user has retweeted or been retweeted by .
Activeness : the frequency or the ratio of tweets , retweets , and hashtags a user has posted in the past .
We refer to these measures as role unspecific measures , which would provide a baseline prediction model not specific to either of the roles . Together with the four families of content and community specific measures ( role specific features ) , these general measures will be instantiated in Section 4 and used in the regression and prediction analysis .
4 . DATA AND FEATURE INSTANTIATION We have introduced formal measures to quantify rolespecific factors of hashtag adoption , including the relevance , preference , prestige , and influence . Do the measures make sense ? Are these factors truly correlated with the use of hashtags ? As a proof of concept , we first conduct a straight forward exploratory analysis to demonstrate the correlation between each of the factors and the user behavior of hashtag usage . We start with an introduction of the datasets and the specific instantiations of the measures used in our analysis . 4.1 Datasets
Two real world datasets are collected from Twitter.com , corresponding to two different sampling strategies .
The first dataset collects all the tweets posted by a sample of political users between March 25th 2007 to December 13th 2010 [ 24 ] . The sample frame of the political users consists of House , Senate and gubernatorial candidates during the midterm elections in the United States ( ie , year 2010 ) . The twitter accounts of these candidates are matched by querying Google with the names of the candidates and keyword “ Twitter . ” Then a manual process is applied to inspect and filter the top 3 results so that only the Twitter accounts operated by the candidates or their staff are kept in the collection . Different from [ 24 ] , we do not further filter the set of users according to their activity level . Hence , the dataset , notated as the Politics dataset , contains 373 , 439 tweets and 9 , 343 hashtags posted by 1 , 029 users .
The second dataset is constructed from a random sample of tweets at a much larger scale . This sample is drawn from a roughly 5 % sampled stream of tweets between June 1 2009 and December 31 2009 . This dataset , notated as the Stream dataset , includes roughly 19 million users , 49 million unique hashtags , and 476 million tweets . 4.2 Instantiation of Measures
Given a time period ∆ , a user u , and a hashtag h which was created before ∆ , we construct a user hashtag pair hu , hi . We then use the hashtag usage , ie , the number of times h is used by u during ∆ , to surrogate the level of interest of the user on the hashtag . If h hasn’t been used by u during and before ∆ , the level of interest will be set to zero .
We now present all the particular instantiations of the general measures proposed in Section 3 . These instances are used in the explanatory analysis to demonstrate their correlation to hashtag usage . They will also be used as independent variables in the regression and features in the prediction model to predict hashtag adoption .
Note that most of the measures , including the the four role specific measures , are sensitive to time . In our analysis , we carefully select time windows of various lengths to instantiate these measures . We introduce additional notations related to the selection of time windows : ∆ as a time window , n∆ u,h as the frequency u uses h during ∆ , nr∆ u,h as the frequency of hashtag usage in retweets , and D∆ u,h as set of tweets containing h that are posted by u during ∆ . Table 1 summarizes all features instantiated from both the role unspecific measures ( ie , baseline features ) and the four role specific measures . Please note that the similarity of two hashtags is computed based on either the tweets or the users using the hashtags , instead of based on the hashtag strings . 4.3 A Demonstrative Analysis
Now that we have the particular instantiations of the adoption behavior and the features according to the rolespecific factors , we present a simple correlation analysis to demonstrate the relationship between these role specific factors and a user ’s degree of interests in a hashtag ( surrogated by the frequency of using a hashtag ) .

As a proof of concept , we collected users who have posted more than 5 hashtags during a 10 day time window between November 1st and November 10th 2009 from the Stream dataset , and randomly sampled 30,106 users from them . We then collected all hashtags tweeted by these 30,106 users during this period , from which we obtained 269,712 userhashtag pairs . We then obtained 40,427 user hashtag pairs from the Politics dataset between August 1st and October 30th 2010 . Note that identical time window is used to calculate the hashtag usage and the features .
To make it easier to visualize , we bin the values of each feature into buckets , so that each bucket contains the same number of user hashtag pairs . The plots in Figure 2 present the correlation between the degree of interest in a hashtag and the role specific factors . Not surprisingly , the degree of interest of a user in a hashtag highly correlates with all four factors : relevance to the content , personal preference of the user , community prestige , as well as social influence . Intuitively , this suggests that the factors of selecting a content tag and the factors of joining a community are both affecting the behavior of using a hashtag .
The result of this demonstrative analysis looks promising . However , the simple correlation analysis does not provide evidence on whether these factors have the predictive power of the adoption of a hashtag , or whether they would make a joint effect in reality . To draw convincing conclusions , we proceed with a formal regression analysis .
5 . REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Beyond the intuitively promising results from the correlation analysis , we are looking for formal evidences on 1 ) whether each of the proposed measures has a predictive power of hashtag adoption ; 2 ) if yes , how significant the effect is ; and 3 ) whether the effect remains significant when the factors interplay with each other .
We thus conduct a regression analysis with the hashtag adoption behavior as the response ( dependent ) variable . Three groups of users are constructed from our two datasets :
1 ) a group of users selected from the Politics dataset , namely the Politics group ;
2 ) an interest based group of users selected from the Stream dataset , namely the Movie group ;
3 ) a group of users randomly sampled from the Stream dataset , namely the Random group . 5.1 Experiment Setup
We formulate the regression analysis such that the dependent variable corresponds to whether or not a user will adopt a hashtag in a time period in the future . The independent variables correspond to particular instantiations of the measures in Section 3 , either role specific or role unspecific . Since it is impossible to observe future events , we hold out the observations from a time window of 10 days , ∆1 , to surrogate the hashtag adoption behaviors in the future . Values of all independent variables are computed only based on the observations in a time period ∆0 prior to ∆1 .
We prepare the data of our regression analysis as follows : 1 ) Given a dataset and a time window ∆1 , we extract either the complete set of users or a sample of users , all of which have been using hashtags recently ( ie , within 10 days prior to the held out period ∆1 ) . The sampling process will be discussed in the next subsection .
2 ) For each user u selected in 1 ) , we collect all hashtags posted by u in the held out period ∆1 ( ie , in the “ future ” ) but have not appeared in any tweet of u before ∆1 . These hashtags are “ adopted ” by the user in the held out period . Every such pair hu , hi is formatted as a data point in the regression analysis , with the outcome variable set to 1 .
3 ) For each user u selected , we randomly sample a set of hashtags from up to 10 days prior to ∆1 , which have not been used by u in either ∆1 or ever before . These hashtags are representatives of those that exist but are not adopted by the user . Every such pair hu , hi is also formatted as a data point , with the outcome variable set to 0 .
In the regression analysis , we use 10 days between November 11th 2009 and November 20th 2009 as the held out period ∆1 for the Movie and the Random group . For the Politics group , we partition the period between August 1st and October 30th 2010 into nine equivalent time windows and employed each of them as a held out period . The length of each held out period Delta1 is thus also 10 days . For all data points sampled through the above procedure , we compute the values of all the independent variables ( ie , one particular instantiation for each role specific or role unspecific measure ) based on all the tweets posted within 30 days before ∆1 and the snapshot of the retweet network right before ∆1 . In other words , ∆0 is designed as the 30 day time window prior to ∆1 , with respect to each particular realization of ∆1 . Below we provide more details on how the users and user hashtag pairs are sampled .
511 Sample Users
The first task of data preparation is to select the set of users from a given dataset . As for the Politics dataset , we simply select all users who have used at least one hashtag within 10 days before the held out period ∆1 , representing active hashtag users . For the Stream dataset , however , it is computationally costly to run the analysis on all the 17 million users . We thus apply the following two sampling frames : an interest based sample and a random sample .
Interest based sampling
Our first sampling frame targets at users with a focused aspect of interest . We chose “ movie ” as our target aspect because i ) many trending topics are related to movies according to the “ Top Twitter Topics ” by Mashable3 , and ii ) people discuss a lot on movie related topics in real life .
In particular , we select the set of users from the Stream dataset using the following snowball sampling procedure :
1 ) Construct the retweet network from the complete col lection of the Stream dataset .
2 ) Select top 3 most popular Twitter users from Twellow4 in category “ movies ” as seeding users .
3 ) Following the out links in the retweet network , we collect all the first order and second order neighbors of the seedling users . With such a process , we have selected users who have either retweeted the three seedling users , or have retweeted another user who have retweeted them .
Combing the seedling users , their first order and secondorder out neighbors , a pool of 178,323 Twitter users is constructed . A further process selects a set of users who have posted at least one hashtag within 10 days before ∆1 . In

Figure 2 : The degree of interest in hashtags correlates to the role specific factors .
( b ) The POLITICS dataset the end , we obtain 8,029 users for this group , and we name the group as the Movie group .
Random sampling
Another sampling strategy is to randomly select users from the entire dataset . We gather all users that appear in the Stream dataset , and randomly select a set of users who have posted at least one hashtag within 10 days prior to ∆1 . In the end , we collected 15,038 users for this group , which is named as the Random group .
512 Sample Negative Examples
Given a set of users , it is straightforward to generate data points ( ie , user hashtag pairs ) with a positive outcome of hashtag adoption . The data points with a negative outcome ( ie , the event that a hashtag is not adopted ) , however , is trickier . The simplest way is to create a negative example for each existing hashtag ( ie , within 10 days before the held out period ∆1 ) that a user did not use during ∆1 . However , the massive number of hashtags simply makes the negative examples dominating the collection , diluting all useful signal . Thus , for each user , we randomly sample negative examples proportional to the number of positive examples ( ie , number of hashtags adopted by this user ) .
5.2 Results of Regression Analysis
We employ logistic regression to predict the adoption of hashtags in the held out time period ∆1 from features computed based on ∆0 prior to ∆1 . One instantiation of each measure is included . We set the time window ∆0 as the period of 30 days prior to ∆1 . To comprehensively understand the predictive power of the role specific measures , we also incorporate baseline features into the regression analysis . Table 2 presents the results of the regression analysis .
Apparently , all the four role specific measures have a significant and positive predictive power of hashtag adoption , even when merged together with all baseline measures . One baseline measure , the variable Popularity in the Movie and Random group , yields a negative coefficient in the regression . This is because the popularity of a hashtag is highly correlated with the sum of prestige of hashtag users ( eg , with a correlation over 0.9196 in the Movie group ) . However , such correlation in the Politics group is lower , thus yielding a positive coefficient for Popularity . Indeed , when we remove the Prestige variable from the regression , the coefficient of Popularity becomes positive in the two groups ( and remain significant ) . The Length of hashtags presents a negative relationship with hashtag adoption , possibly because people tend to adopt short and concise hashtags .
The results of the regression analysis thus provide a much stronger evidence that both the content role and the community role affect hashtag adoption . All four role specific factors we presented have a significant positive predictive power to the adoption of hashtags .
6 . PREDICTION ANALYSIS
The regression analysis has proved that all the role specific measures are predictive to the adoption of hashtags . This reassures our hypothesis that the dual role of a hashtag affects the adoption . We are , however , moving forward to investigate the feasibility of constructing an effective prediction and recommender systems . Unfortunately , the regression analysis doesn’t tell how an effective prediction system can be constructed based on these measures , or how hashtag recommendation can be done . To test the feasibility of hashtag recommendation , we proceed with building a machine learning model to predict the adoption of new hashtags in the future . Compared to the regression analysis that serves as a white box to interpret the effect of the measures , this analysis provides a black box that aims at optimizing the accuracy of of predictions .

Consistent to the regression analysis , we setup three experiments over three groups of users , and sample negative examples accordingly . Held out time periods are employed to surrogate the “ future . ” The prediction problem is cast as a binary classification task : whether or not a user will adopt a new hashtag in a held out period . The performance of such a classifier is evaluated by the accuracy of the predicted classes . Strictly , the behavior of a user to adopt a hashtag in her own tweets is quite different from adopting a hashtag by retweeting others . The former is spontaneous and the latter is passive . We further differentiate the tasks of predicting hashtag adoption in all tweets , retweets , and user composed tweets ( ie , non retweets ) respectively .
Different from the regression analysis , we train the prediction model with a training dataset and assess the effectiveness with a separate test dataset . To do this , we select different pairs of “ history ” ( ∆0 ) and “ future ” ( ∆1 ) time windows . We then use some “ history future ” pairs to train the prediction model , and use other time window pairs to test the model . From each pair of time windows , we sample a collection of user hashtag pairs as data examples . For each data example , we then compute all the features in Table 1 based on ∆0 , and identify the label ( positive or negative ) based on whether the hashtag is adopted by the user during ∆1 . The number of positive and negative samples in our training and test datasets are presented in Table 3 . 6.2 Results and Discussion
We first employ an SVM classifier with all baseline features in Table 1 . The RBF kernel is adopted , and 5 fold cross validation is used to select parameters . The performance of the SVM predictor is presented in Table 4 . Such a baseline model performs reasonably well with 68 % accuracy on the Politics group and around 75 % on both the Movie group and the Random group , comparing to a 50 % accuracy of random guess . We then add the all features instantiating each of the four role specific measures into the classifier , to test the four families of measures one by one , and then altogether . The inclusion of each of the four families of measures has improved the prediction performance significantly , with a few exceptions of the Prestige measures . In all three groups , the mixture of all four families of features has further improved the prediction accuracy .
The only exception is the prestige measure on the Movie and Random group . Surprisingly , the inclusion of the prestige measure even decreases the prediction performance when all tweets are considered . While on the Politics group , the prestige features performed significantly well . This is possibly due to the way prestige is computed . Of both the Movie group and the Random group , prestige is computed based on the global retweet network of millions of users , most of which are not part of the group . Therefore , the prestige is global and unspecific to the community of the group . Of the Politics group , however , the retweet network is specific to the community . The prestige is thus relatively “ localized ” and more specific to the user group [ 4 ] . Therefore , we further conducted an experiment to remove the prestige measures from the Movie and the Random group . The accuracy of the prediction task over Movie group increased from 80.64 % to 82.00 % , and the accuracy over Random group increased from 84.03 % to 8435 %
Interestingly , predicting the hashtag adoption in retweets seems to be easier than predicting the behavior in spontaneous tweets ( Movie and Random ) . The exception is the Politics group , where the candidates prefer to tweet rather than to retweet ( Table 3 ) . In general , it is reasonable that the prediction of content in retweets is easier than the prediction of spontaneous tweeting behavior .
With all features included , the best prediction model achieves an accuracy around 80 % among all datasets . This is a promising result , suggesting the feasibility of building effective recommender systems of hashtags in Twitter .
7 . CONCLUSION
We presented a formal empirical analysis to test how the dual role of hashtags in Twitter affects hashtag adoption . Results of a correlation analysis , a regression analysis , and a prediction analysis all suggest that a hashtag serves as both a tag of content and a symbol of membership of a community . The measures we propose to quantify the factors of tagging content or joining communities all present significant predictive power to the adoption of hashtags . The prediction analysis using a SVM predictor provides a feasibility study of hashtag recommender systems , which suggests a promising future direction of research .
