ABSTRACT This paper aims at leveraging microblogs to address two challenges in music information retrieval ( MIR ) , similarity estimation between music artists and inferring typical listening patterns at different granularity levels ( city , country , global ) . From two collections of several million microblogs , which we gathered over ten months , music related information is extracted and statistically analyzed . We propose and evaluate four co occurrence based methods to compute artist similarity scores . Moreover , we derive and analyze culture specific music listening patterns to investigate the diversity of listening behavior around the world .

INTRODUCTION
The large and ever growing amount of user generated content in today ’s social media platforms constitutes a tremendously wealthy , albeit noisy source for various data mining tasks . In particular , microblogging has encountered a considerable gain in popularity during the past few years as it provides an easy way for everyone to report on activities and thoughts . Today ’s most popular microblogging service Twitter [ 5 ] has more than 200 million registered users [ 3 ] who are creating a billion posts every week [ 1 ] ( as of March/April 2011 ) . Twitter thus represents a rich data source for text based information extraction ( IE ) and information retrieval ( IR ) .

Music is omnipresent on the ( social ) web as it plays an important role in many human lives . Everybody enjoys listening to his favorite tunes , and many people share their opinions about songs , artists , or latest album releases . Some even share their own versions of favored music videos . Digital music distribution and consumption are also important economic factors , which is demonstrated by the current success of music streaming services such as Spotify [ 4 ] .
Given the importance both social media and music consumption play for many people , this work addresses the following research questions :
1 . Can we create a similarity measure for music artists based on microblogs ?
2 . Are there typical listening patterns encoded in tweets ? If so , do they differ among different places in the world ? What can we learn about differences between countries or cities ?
Elaborating music similarity measures that reflect resemblance perceived by humans is one of the big challenges in music information retrieval ( MIR ) . These similarity measures enable applications such as music recommender systems [ 10 , 16 ] , automated playlist generators [ 36 , 38 ] , or intelligent user interfaces to music collections [ 37 , 32 ] . Computational features for music similarity calculation can be broadly categorized into content based , music context based , and user context based . While content based feature extraction techniques derive the representation of a music item from the audio signal itself [ 15 ] , music context based approaches make use of data that is not encoded in the signal [ 44 ] , for instance , the performer ’s political background , the meaning of a song ’s lyrics , images of album covers , or cooccurrence information derived from playlists . Both contentbased and music context based techniques to model musical similarity are relatively well researched in terms of publication numbers , although they are still far from being highly accurate . In contrast , feature extraction and similarity measurement approaches that take into account the user ’s context are relatively sparse throughout the scientific literature . An overview of user context features likely to be useful for MIR tasks is presented in [ 45 ] .
The work at hand is one of the first to tackle the intersection between music context and user context since microblog data is available at the level of individual users , but can also be aggregated to model similarity at the city , country , or global level . The similarity measurement models proposed here are therefore capable of reflecting music perception at
WWW 2012 – AdMIRe'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France877 different scopes , which is a promising path to follow when aiming at creating personalized retrieval models [ 53 ] .
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 reviews related literature on microblog mining and text based similarity . Section 3 reports on the acquisition of music related , geospatialized tweets and presents results of preliminary statistical analyses . Our approaches to infer similarity between artists from microblogs are presented in Section 4 , together with an evaluation . In Section 5 we then address the second research question , which is analyzing geographical differences in listening patterns around the world . Eventually , Section 6 summarizes the main findings and points to some future research directions .
2 . RELATED WORK
Related literature basically falls into two groups : text based similarity measurement and microblog mining . Whereas the former has a long tradition , ranging back several decades , the latter is a rather young research field . 2.1 Text based Similarity Measurement
There exists a wide range of literature on modeling text documents according to the bag of words principle using vector space representations , eg [ 9 , 40 , 35 ] . Since elaborating on all publications related to the discipline of text IR is out of this article ’s scope , we focus on work dealing with text IR in the context of music and multimedia retrieval on the Web , as this context is closely related to the work at hand .
Text data in the multimedia domain generally constitutes context information or contextual data , opposed to contentbased features directly extracted from the media items . Deriving term feature vectors from Web pages for the purpose of music artist similarity estimation was first undertaken in [ 22 ] . Cohen and Fan automatically extract lists of artist names from Web pages , which are found by querying Web search engines . The resulting pages are then parsed according to their DOM tree , and all plain text content with minimum length of 250 characters is further analyzed for occurrences of entity names . Term vectors of co occurring artist names are then used for artist recommendation . Using artist names to build term vector representations , whose term weights are computed as co occurrence scores , is an approach also followed later in [ 54 , 46 ] . In contrast to Cohen and Fan ’s approach , the authors of [ 54 , 46 ] derive the term weights from search engine ’s page count estimates and suggest their method for artist recommendation .
Automatically querying a Web search engine to determine pages related to a specific topic is a common and intuitive task , which is therefore frequently performed for data acquisition in IE research . Examples in the music domain can be found in [ 52 , 26 ] , whereas [ 19 , 20 , 31 ] apply this technique in a more general context .
Building term feature vectors from term sets other than artist names is performed in [ 52 ] , where Whitman and Lawrence extract different term sets ( unigrams , bigrams , noun phrases , artist names , and adjectives ) from up to 50 artistrelated Web pages obtained via a search engine . After downloading the pages , the authors apply parsers and a part ofspeech ( POS ) tagger [ 14 ] to assign each word to its suited test set(s ) . An individual term profile for each artist is then created by employing a version of the TF·IDF measure . The overlap between the term profiles of two artists , ie , the sum of weights of all terms that occur in both term profiles , is then used as an estimate for their similarity .
Extending the work presented in [ 52 ] , Baumann and Hummel [ 11 ] introduce filters to prune the set of retrieved Web pages . First , they remove all Web pages with a size of more than 40 kilobytes ( after parsing ) . They also try to filter out advertisements by ignoring text in table cells comprising more than 60 characters , but not forming a correct sentence . Finally , Baumann and Hummel perform keyword spotting in the URL , the title , and the first text part of each page . Each occurrence of the initial query parts ( artist name , “ music ” , and “ review ” ) contributes to a page score . Pages that score too low are filtered out .
Knees et al . present in [ 30 ] an approach similar to [ 52 ] . Unlike Whitman and Lawrence who experiment with different term sets , Knees et al . use only one list of unigrams . For each artist , a weighted term profile is created by applying a TF·IDF variant . Calculating the similarity between the term profiles of two artists is then performed using the cosine similarity . Knees et al . evaluate their approach in a genre classification setting using as classifiers k Nearest Neighbor ( kNN ) and Support Vector Machines ( SVM ) [ 50 ] .
Other approaches derive term profiles from more specific Web resources . In [ 17 ] , for example , Celma et al . propose a music search engine that crawls audio blogs via RSS feeds and calculates TF·IDF features . Hu et al . in [ 27 ] extract TF based features from music reviews gathered from Epinions.com [ 25 ] . In [ 42 ] Schedl extracts user posts associated with music artists from the microblogging service Twitter and models term profiles using term lists specific to the music domain . Although one of the goals ( artist similarity measurement ) and the data source ( microblogs ) in [ 42 ] resemble the work at hand , [ 42 ] bases the similarity computation on TF·IDF representations of music artists , whereas the approaches reported in this paper derive a similarity estimate from co occurrence information .
2.2 Microblog Mining
With the advent of microblogging a huge , albeit noisy data source became available . Literature dealing with microblogs can be broadly categorized into works that study human factors or properties of the Twittersphere and works that exploit microblogs for information extraction and retrieval tasks .
As for the former , Teevan et al . [ 49 ] analyze query logs to uncover differences in search behavior between users of classical Web search engines and users looking for information in microblogs . They found that Twitter queries are shorter and more popular than bing [ 12 ] queries on average . Furthermore , microblogs are more often sought for people , opinions , and breaking news . In terms of query formulation , reissuing the same query can be more frequently observed in microblog search . In Web search , by contrast , modifying and extending a query is very popular .
Java et al . [ 28 ] study network properties of the microblogosphere as well as geographical distributions and intentions of Twitter users . The authors report that Twitter is most popular in North America , Europe , and Asia ( Japan ) , and that same language is an important factor for cross connections ( “ followers ” and “ friends ” ) over continents . Employing the HITS algorithm [ 29 ] on the network of “ friend ” relations , Java et al . further derived user intentions from structural properties . They identified the fol
WWW 2012 – AdMIRe'12 WorkshopApril 16–20 , 2012 , Lyon , France878 lowing categories : information sharing , information seeking , and friendship wise relationships . Analyzing the content of Twitter posts , the authors distilled the following intentions : daily chatter , conversations , sharing information/URLs , and reporting news .
In a recent study , Kwak et al . perform a topological analysis of the Twitter network [ 33 ] . The authors report a low level of reciprocity , ie , only 22 % of the connections between users are bidirectional . The average path length was found to be only four , which is surprisingly small for a network the size of the Twittersphere and considering the directional network structure . Moreover , a moderate level of homophily , ie , a higher likelihood for connections between similar people than between dissimilar people , was discovered when measuring similarity in terms of geographic location and user popularity . In addition , Kwak et al . ’s study indicates that information diffusion after the first retweet is very fast .
Work related to content mining of microblogs includes the following : Cheng et al . propose a method to localize Twitter users based on spatial cues ( “ local ” words ) extracted from their tweets’ content [ 18 ] . To this end , in a first step several classifiers are trained to identify words with a strong geospatial meaning . In order to deal with the sparsity in the distribution of these cues , different smoothing approaches , eg , taking into account neighboring cities when constructing the term representation of a city , are applied subsequently . In an experiment conducted on a set of tweets posted within the USA , Cheng et al . ’s approach placed more than a half of the users within a 100 mile radius of their correct location . Making use of the fact that tweets are a good source for up to date information and breaking news , Dong et al . propose in [ 23 ] an approach to identify fresh URLs in Twitter posts . To this end , the authors investigate content based features extracted from the tweets , an authority score computed for each user , and Twitter specific statistical features , such as number of retweets or number of users that replied to a message containing a tiny URL . They show that these features can be used to improve both recency ranking and relevance ranking in real time Web search . Another work that aims at improving ranking can be found in [ 24 ] . Duan et al . propose a novel ranking strategy for tweet retrieval . To this end , they investigate different feature sets , including content based features , Twitter specific features , and authority scores of users ( followers , retweeters , mentioners ) . Using a learning to rank algorithm , the authors found that the best performing features are authority scores , length of a tweet , and whether the tweet contains a URL .
An approach to classifying tweets can be found in [ 48 ] . Sriram et al . describe each tweet by an eight dimensional feature vector comprising the author of the post and seven binary attributes indicating , for example , occurrence of slang words , currency and percentage signs , or the use of capitalization and repeated characters . Sriram et al . ’s feature set outperformed the standard bag of words approach using a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier to categorize tweets into the five classes news , events , opinions , deals , and private messages . Armentano et al . present in [ 7 ] a recommender system that suggests potentially interesting users to follow based on the similarity between tweets posted by the seed user and tweets posted by a set of candidate users . To this end , the authors create and investigate different user profiles , for example , modeling the seed user via term frequencies of his/her aggregate posts or of all of his/her followees . Related to Armentano et al . ’s work , Weng et al . aim at identifying influential twitterers for a given topic [ 51 ] . To this end , they apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) [ 13 ] to their corpus of tweets . Subsequently , topical similarity between twitterers is computed as the Jensen Shannon divergence between the distribution of the latent topics of the respective users . Further taking into account the link structure , Weng et al . propose a ranking function for influential twitterers in each topic . Similar to [ 7 ] , Weng et al . evaluate their approach in a recommendation setting .
Microblogs have also been exploited for the purpose of event and trend detection . Sakaki et al . propose semantic analysis of tweets to detect earthquakes in Japan in realtime [ 39 ] . A more general approach to automatically detect events and summarize trends by analyzing tweets is presented by Sharifi et al . [ 47 ] . Another work on trend detection is [ 43 ] , where Schedl exploits tweets for spatio temporal popularity estimation of music artists . Sankaranarayanan et al . aim at capturing tweets that report on breaking news [ 41 ] . They cluster the identified tweets according to their T F · IDF weights and cosine similarity . Furthermore , each cluster is assigned a set of geographic locations using both spatial clues in the tweets themselves and explicit location information as indicated by the twitterers .
3 . DATA ACQUISITION AND ANALYSIS
Between May 2010 and March 2011 we crawled Twitter for the hashtag #nowplaying ( or its equivalent #NP ) in the postings since this hashtag has already been successfully used in the context of spatio temporal popularity estimation in [ 43 ] . Our crawls were restricted to tweets with geospatial information and to all cities > 500,000 inhabitants ( 790 cities around the world were gathered from World Gazetteer [ 6] ) . We included tweets within a radius of 50 kilometers around the city center ’s coordinates . Between November 2010 and March 2011 we gathered a second data set , focusing on tweets including #itunes , since this hashtag is frequently used among users of Apple ’s iTunes and related programs . There also exists a popular plug in for Apple ’s social network Ping that automatically tweets iTunes listening activities using this very hashtag .
We were able to retrieve 9,928,817 tweets for #nowplaying and 725,486 tweets for #itunes , respectively . We will henceforth refer to these data sets simply as #nowplaying and #itunes . If not explicitly mentioned , our analysis was conducted on the larger data set ( #nowplaying ) .
There exist , of course , tweets about music that do neither include the hashtag #nowplaying , nor #itunes . Elaborating a more general , text based tweet classifier that detects microblogs about music will be part of future work . 3.1 Preprocessing
In order to use the crawled tweets for further processing we had to map the tweets to artist names , which raises some challenges . In a first attempt we tried to use a dictionarybased text matching algorithm . However , this approach led to many mis classifications as parts of song titles or artist names had been identified as artists , which was especially true for common speech terms and first names . Additionally , there is no fixed format for Twitter postings and several tweets featuring the hashtags under consideration also contain comments . Stopping [ 9 ] is not an option in this case

To improve our matching algorithm we identified a number of common patterns in the tweets , including “ songtitle by artistname ” , “ artistname – songtitle ” , “ #artistname ” , etc . , and we matched the potential artist names against a list of 110,588 known artists . The artist set is publicly available.1 We were able to identify 31,328 unique artists in 4,237,430 of the 9,928,817 tweets , each artist appearing between 1 and 38,335 ( Rihanna ) times ( μ = 144.89 , σ = 907.96 , median = 12 ) in the #nowplaying data set . From the #itunes data set we extracted 13,002 artists from 220,641 tweets ( min = 1 , max = 5,416 ( The Beatles ) , μ = 17.52 , σ = 94.54 , median = 3 ) . We were able to retrieve data from 766 ( 603 ) different cities in 127 ( 107 ) countries . Tables 1 and 2 show the top 10 cities and countries , respectively , in terms of the number of postings .
3.2 Distribution of Play Counts
To assess whether the distribution of play counts , that is the total number of each artist ’s occurrences in the data set , follows a power law p(x ) ∼ x −α for x ≥ xmin , we employ the approach presented in [ 21 ] , using Maximum Likelihood Estimation ( MLE ) . The estimated parameters of the power law model ( significantly well ) fitted to the data are as follows :
#nowplaying : α = 2.10 , xmin = 697
#itunes : α = 2.01 , xmin = 16

4 . SIMILARITY ESTIMATION
In order to estimate artist similarities we computed a cooccurrence matrix X for artists listened to by the same user . Element x(i , j ) denotes the co occurrence count between artists i and j . For each artist we found between 0 and 16,999 co occurring artists ( μ = 1,392 , σ = 2,040 , median = 450 ) for #nowplaying and between 0 and 3,832 co occurring artists ( μ = 69.91 , σ = 154.52 , median = 15 ) for #itunes . Due to space limitations , we will report on our similarity estimation experiments for the #nowplaying data set only . 4.1 Normalization
For the normalization of the co occurrence matrices , which eventually yields item to item similarity matrices , we evaluated four different approaches ( the first one simply computes the relative frequency , algorithms two and three make use of a popularity correction factor [ 52] ) :
1 . sim(i , j ) =
2 . sim(i , j ) = x(i , j ) occ(i )
· x(i , j ) occ(i )
. 1 − |occ(i ) − occ(j)| fi maxk occ(k )
. 1 − |occ(i ) − occ(j)| · fi maxk occ(k )
3 . sim(i , j ) =
4 . sim(i , j ) =
' x(i , j ) min(occ(i ) , occ(j ) ) x(i , j ) occ(i ) · occ(j ) with occ(i ) being the number of occurrences of artist i within the set of tweets . 4.2 Evaluation
In a first step we evaluated the four artist similarity measures in a similar artist prediction setting , using the list of top ranked similar artists from last.fm [ 34 ] as ground truth . As some artists appeared too infrequently in the data sets to create a reliable similarity predictor , we had to define a

We were able to retrieve our ground truth for 6,885 , respectively 1,137 of these artists . For the set with a minimum of 50 tweets per artist , last.fm returned between 2 and 93 similar artists ( μ = 27.20 , σ = 20.46 , median = 22 ) , for the smaller set between 2 and 71 similar artists ( μ = 23.74 , σ = 15.45 , median = 21 ) .
The R precision [ 8 ] for the overlap in Table 3 shows that the normalization algorithms 2 and 4 work best . However , comparing the two data sets we see that the algorithms perform differently . A closer look at the precision recall curves in Figure 2 shows that symmetric algorithms ( 3 and 4 ) have a flatter curve , ie , they lose less in precision while the number of predictions increases . Figure 3 shows that for the smaller data set ( ie , the more popular artists ) symmetric algorithms perform relatively better , especially for an increasing number of predictions . Among the symmetric algorithms 4 always performs better than 3 . For the asymmetric algorithms we can see that the popularity factor in algorithm 2 always leads to better results than the relative frequency alone . The maximum F measures achieved are listed in Table 4 for both thresholds ( 50 and 500 ) for the minimum number of artist occurrences . The column pred indicates the number k of predicted similar artists , for which this maximum F measure was achieved .
In a next step we evaluated the rank proximity , predicting the k most similar artists ( l=number of artists in the ground truth ) , and defining precision and recall equivalents using a weighted rank proximity as follows : method normalization

If a predicted artist is not found in the ground truth , we set a penalty of 0 . Therefore , in contrast to the standard definitions of precision and recall , the true positives in our rank proximity formulation do not count as “ one ” if there is an overlap , but only if the rank is correct as well . By dividing the absolute rank difference by the maximum rank in ground truth and prediction , we put a stronger penalty on errors of top ranked items . From Figures 4 and 5 we see that normalization algorithm 4 again dominates over the others and that the symmetric algorithms benefits from a lower number of artists .
5 . EXTRACTING GEOSPATIAL LISTENING
PATTERNS
The second objective of this work relates to extracting geospatial listening patterns from microblogs , analyzing if and in which way they differ among different parts of the world and at different granularity levels , and eventually , interpret these ( presumable ) differences .

Figure 5 : F measure equivalence using rank proximity for number of predicted artists . we infer such listening patterns at the level of cities and countries .
To determine typical listening patterns , we use genre information about artists to describe each city/country via a genre distribution vector.2 Aggregating artists on the genre level is necessary because the country artist matrix is too sparse to allow for analyzing the listening patterns on the artist level for most countries . Using the set of allmusic ’s [ 2 ] 18 major genres3 , we retrieve the genre of each artist a as the main genre given by allmusic ’s artist page . We define the listening pattern for a city or country c as the relative frequencies music of each genre is listened to by users within c . The elements of the 18 dimensional genre distribution vector gc for a city or country c are computed as i = 1 . . .18 a∈Gi occa,c a∈A occa,c gc i = where Gi denotes the set of artists assigned to genre i , occa,c is the number of microblogs indicating listening behavior of artist a in city or country c , and A is the set of all artists . We use the relative frequency to account for different intensities of microblogging activity , depending on the scope of interest . Nevertheless , we discard cities or countries for which not enough data is available to derive a reliable listening pattern . To this end , we require at least 100 artist user pairs in the data set to make a prediction , ie , occa,c ≥ 100 . ff a∈A
In order to investigate to which extent the listening patterns differ among different cities or countries c , we calculate the standard deviation of their genre distribution vectors σc over all genres ( from the global mean genre distribution , tak
2The approach is not restricted to the use of genres ; other term sets may feature moods , instruments , or styles . 3The used genres are avantgarde ( av ) , blues ( bl ) , celtic ( ce ) , classical ( cl ) , country ( co ) , easylistening ( ea ) , electronica ( el ) , folk ( fo ) , gospel ( go ) , jazz ( ja ) , latin ( la ) , newage ( ne ) , rap ( ra ) , reggae ( re ) , rnb ( rn ) , rock ( ro ) , vocal ( vo ) , and world ( wo ) . ing the arithmetic mean over the 18 dimensions to come up with a single number ) . This allows us to determine the most and least representative ( or mainstream ) twittering population with respect to the average music listener on a global scale . The results at the country level are illustrated for data sets #nowplaying and #itunes in Figures 6 and 7 , respectively . The first bar in each genre group represents the global mean genre distribution , the subsequent two bars represent the countries with lowest standard deviations , ie , the most mainstream countries , and the last two bars represent the countries whose twitterers have most particular listening behaviors . When deriving listening patterns on the level of individual cities , the most and least mainstream cities are depicted in Figures 8 and 9 , respectively , for sets #nowplaying and #itunes .
We further compute global genre distribution vectors g#np and g#it for both data sets #nowplaying and #itunes , respectively . Comparing these with the genre distribution vector of the ground truth gGT – which is given by the relative frequencies of artists in each genre among the total number of artists in the data set – reveals some interesting differences between the user group that tends to use #nowplaying and the group that tends to use #itunes to tweet listening behavior.4 Figure 10 depicts the genre distribution vectors gGT , g#np , and g#it . It shows , for instance , that electronica , rap , and rock are significantly more popular genres among the #itunes tweeters , compared to their relative share in the ground truth . The same holds for latin , rap , rnb , and rock when focusing on the microbloggers that use #nowplaying to communicate listening activities . On the other hand , almost all other genres are significantly less popular among both user groups . The '2 distance between gGT and g#np is also larger ( 0.0996 ) than between gGT and g#it ( 0.0796 ) , which indicates a slightly less average music taste for the #itunes listeners than for the #nowplaying tweeterers .
4The second one presumably consists foremost of listeners who use Apple ’s iTunes .

6 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We reported on mining social microblogs for music related information and showed that Twitter postings can be used to derive similarity measures for artists . We compared different normalization approaches against similarity information from last.fm for their overlap and their weighted rank proximity . In addition , we derived music listening patterns , represented as genre distribution vectors , at different granularities ( city , country , global ) . We found that these listening patterns vary strongly for different cities and countries . Moreover , the global patterns revealed a considerable difference between the data sets #nowplaying and #itunes in relation to the mean global genre distribution given by the ground truth .
We are currently preparing the feature data ( in addition to the meta data ) for publication as we believe it represents a valuable source for the research community . Both preprocessed data sets ( #nowplaying and #itunes ) will be available shortly.5 As part of future work , we will investigate more elaborate disambiguation techniques for song and artist names to improve accuracy of the similarity estimators . We believe that preprocessing could be improved by adding track information , eg , for the tweet “ Satellite – Lena ” , both “ Lena ” and “ Satellite ” exist as known artist names , and only additional track information can help to identify “ Lena ” as the artist and “ Satellite ” as the track title and not vice versa . We will further investigate how similarity information derived from microblog data compares to similarity estimation techniques that exploit other data sources , such as the audio signal , music related web pages , or song lyrics . Moreover,we plan to account for temporal dynamics in the microblog data , which matches nicely our ultimate research aim to elaborate personalized and user aware music retrieval and discovery systems that take into account different levels of personalization ( individual , peer group , city , country ) [ 45 ] . The research at hand is also closely related to trend de
