INTRODUCTION
Commerce networks involve buying and selling activities among individuals or organizations . Scientists have extensively studied offline commerce networks over the past decades and have come up methods to model and predict commerce behaviors . Traditionally , commerce networks were obtained from surveys and questionnaires , or simulated from theoretical models . As the growing of the Internet and e commerce , it brings opportunities for obtaining real world online commerce networks , which are magnitude larger than before . These e commerce data are so rich that it can provide much more insights of social commerce interactions . eBay is the largest online marketplaces in the world . There are about 90 million active users on eBay . Not only are tens of thousands worth of items sold , but also a sheer number of social interactions ( eg , listing , bidding , purchasing , etc ) happen every minute . Getting a deeper understanding of e commerce networks in terms of what structure they have , what kind of interactions they afford , what trust and reputation measures exist , and how they evolve has tremendous value in suggesting business opportunities and building effective user applications . An e commerce network , such as eBay , can be analyzed using traditional social network analysis methods . However , it is better to be modeled and analyzed as a complex network , because of its large scale and complex topological features . Complex network analysis methods focus on large scale statistical properties of networks rather than individual entities or relations . Studying these network properties help us better understand the nuances of the marketplaces how they survive , evolve , or deteriorate .
In this paper , we derived trading networks from eBay marketplace and modeled them as complex networks . We first analyzed the macroscopic shape of the networks using the bow tie model and degree distributions , and compared the results with other types of complex networks . We also compared the networks of different eBay categories . The results suggest that in some categories , people actively trade collectible merchandise , while other categories are more like traditional retail business . Next , we studied the local structures of the networks by finding motifs , which are significant connected subnetworks . These two types of categories show different motif patterns as well . Finally , patterns of preferential connections are visually analyzed using Auroral diagrams .
2 . RELATED WORK
As the largest online auction site , eBay has been studied in various areas , including auction models [ 14 , 4 , 13 ] , bidding and selling strategies [ 22 , 10 ] , reputation models [ 11 , 26 , 15 , 21 ] and fraud detection [ 20 ] . However , there is no study on its underlying e commerce network .
655 Many online communities have been modeled and analyzed as complex networks . The bow tie structural analysis is one way to model the macroscopic structure of a network . The research work , which demonstrated the bow tie shape of the Web [ 5 ] has been followed by work on mining communities [ 23 ] and also analysis of specific vertical domains like the Wikipedia [ 28 , 6 ] and online Java forums [ 27 ] . These bodies of work have confirmed the bow tie structure . It has been shown that the Wikipedia network has a much larger strictly connected center core while the network of the Java forum has an unsymmetrical bow tie structure .
For characterization of the microscopic structure of a com plex network , significant recurring regulation patterns , named network motifs , have been studied [ 17 , 3 ] . Motif profiling has been conducted on various networks including genetic networks , neuronal wiring , World Wide Web , social networks , and word adjacency networks . They were clustered into several super families based their motif significance profiles [ 16 ] . More comprehensive reviews of complex network analysis methods can be found in [ 2 , 9 , 19 , 8 ] .
This paper is organized as follows . Section 3 describes the data used in our study . Following that , in Section 4 and Section 5 , we study the global network structure of eBay networks by computing degree distributions and fitting them into the bow tie model . In Section 6 , the local network structure is analyzed through motif profiling . The patterns of preferential connections are studied in Section 7 . Finally , we summarize our results and discuss future directions in Section 8 .
3 . DATA ANALYSIS
We used a dataset of about 78 million transactions of the eBay marketplace involving about 14.5 million users . The data was collected during a period in 2008 . The social commerce network derived from the dataset is a directed graph , G(V , E ) . Each vertex vi denotes an eBay user . An edge from vertex vi to vj exists if vi sold something to vj at least once . The number of transactions between the same seller and buyer determines the edge weight . A vertex in the network can be a seller in some transactions and a buyer in others . 82.5 % of the users only buy , and 5.76 % of the users only sell . There are mutual edges between two vertices . Besides the social network structure , the dataset also captures semantic information including listing titles , categories and users’ feedback scores of each transaction . The data spans over 32 top level categories . Using the category information , we are able to derive sub networks for individual eBay categories .
4 . DEGREE DISTRIBUTION
Degree distribution is one of the most common measures for complex networks . Many complex networks have been found to exhibit the scale free nature characterized by the power law distribution of vertex degrees , ie , p(k ) ∼ k−r , where p(k ) is the fraction of vertices in the network that have degree k [ 7 ] . The eBay commerce network shares this property , as shown in Fig 1 .
The power law exponent of the out degree distribution is around 1.7 , which is much smaller than that of the in degree distribution ( around 298 ) The fraction of the vertices with small out degrees is far fewer than the fraction of those with the same values of in degrees . As the value increases , out in−degree out−degree power law : exp 2.98 power law : exp 1.70

Figure 1 : In degree and out degree distributions of the eBay network exhibit power law phenomenon . The exponent of the fitting power law distribution for the out degree is around 1.70 and for the indegree is around 298 degree curve intersects with the in degree one . The in degree is the number of unique users that a user bought from , and the out degree is the number of unique users he/she sold to . Therefore , in the eBay network , the fraction of small buyers is more significant than that of small sellers . The heavy tail of out degree distribution also suggests that top sellers at eBay dealt with a significant number of buyers . These observations are different from the Web [ 5 ] , in which the out degree and the in degree distributions are similar , but compares to the online Java community [ 27 ] . Our intuition is that the nature of the Web is different from that of these communities . The web is connected by links over static web pages , while online communities including the eBay marketplace and the Java forum are built upon human interactions . In the eBay marketplace , merchandises move from buyers to sellers . In the Java forum , answers and knowledge move from repliers to askers . Our results suggest that the destination of the interaction ( eg , buyers at eBay and askers at the Java forum ) often consists of a large number of casual players , while the source ( eg , sellers at eBay and repliers at the Java forum ) consists of very dominant ones .
At the eBay marketplace , a user ’s feedback score represents his/her reputation . The feedback score is the number of positive feedbacks he/she received from unique users minus the number of negative ones . The feedback score is crucial to all the selling and buying activities at eBay . Fig 2 shows the distribution of feedback scores . There are a tiny percentage of users with negative feedback scores . They are dropped in the log scale figure , and the effect to the overall distribution can be neglected . The feedback score distribution also exhibits power law phenomenon , at the exponent around 205 However , the lower end of the feedback score distribution is highly bended .
The eBay marketplace contains 32 top level categories , which varies from Stamps to Consumer Electronics . We can imagine that the interactions in trading stamps are very different from those in selling electronics . We are thus interested in comparing the network structures of different cat

Figure 2 : Feedback score distribution exhibits power law phenomenon . The exponent of fitting power law distribution is around 205 egories . Fig 3 shows the degree and feedback score distributions of the sub networks of 8 selected categories . All of them show power law phenomenon . The figures are roughly arranged according to the shape of the in degree and the outdegree distributions . For Stamps and Sports Cards , the indegree distribution is more bended at the low end . In other words , there are less small buyers than a standard powerlaw distribution . At the high end , the in degree and the out degree distributions are more similar comparing to other categories . Our understanding of the eBay marketplace also tells us that these categories are where avid collectors actively trade their collections . Moving toward Fig 3(h ) , both degree distributions fit better with the power law . The tails of the out degree distribution are heavier . For instance , in Computer & Networking and Consumer Electronics , the top sellers are more dominant than those in the collectible categories . The activities in these categories are more like traditional retail mode in which a large number of small consumers buy from a few very large retailers .
5 . SHAPE OF THE EBAY NETWORK
The bow tie model is a widely used method to analyze the large scale structure of a complex network . The key idea is that a complex network can be separated into six components : SCC , IN , OUT , Tendrils , Tubes and Disconnected . The SCC is the maximal strongly connected component , in which for every pair of vertices vi and vj , there is a path from vi to vj and a path from vj to vi5 . The vertices , from which one always reaches the SCC , form the IN component , while the OUT component consists of vertices that can be reached from the SCC . There are paths from the IN component to the OUT component without going through the SCC . The vertices along these paths form the Tubes . The Tendrils component gathers vertices that either can reach the OUT component or are reachable from the IN component , but do not belong to any other defined components . The Disconnected component consists of the vertices that are disconnected to other components . The bow tie model was first introduced to measure the World Wide Web [ 5 ] .

Figure 3 : The in degree , out degree , and feedback score distributions of 8 representative categories . The power law is applicable to all of them . The figures are roughly arranged by the shape of the indegree and the out degree distributions . The categories vary from hard core collector networks ( eg , Stamps and Sports Cards ) to retailer networks ( eg , Computer & Networking and Consumer Electronics ) . In the collector networks , users actively trade items , while in the retailer networks , a few big sellers sell to a huge number of small buyers .
657 Subsequent research has shown similar shapes for networks like Java forums [ 27 ] , and Wikipedia pages [ 28 , 6 ] .
The bow tie shape of the eBay network is illustrated in Fig 4 . The structure is unsymmetrical . The OUT component ( 65.83 % ) is much larger than the IN component ( 303 % ) The SCC ( 5.83 % ) is very small . There are significant amount of Tendrils ( 2359 % ) We compared it with some previous observations ( See Table 1 ) .
We can see that both the Web and Wikipedia have symmetric bow tie structures . The Java forum and the eBay network share the unsymmetrical structure with very large OUT components . In addition , the SCC component of the Java forum and the eBay network are much smaller than those of the Web and Wikipedia . The Web and Wikipedia networks are both information networks , which reflect the underlying organization of knowledge and concepts . Both the Java forum and eBay consist of social interactions . The destinations of the interactions ( ie , buyers and askers ) are much more than the sources of the interactions ( ie , sellers and repliers ) . In other words , a small group of players provide merchandises or answers to a much larger group of players in a social interaction network . This result agrees with our observations from the degree distributions in Section 4 .
Who are the typical users in each component ? What are their typical behaviors ? We analyzed the demographics of each component by average feedback scores , average and percentages of sales and purchases ( See Table 2 ) . 59.8 % of sales were made by users in the SCC , which are only 5.8 % of the population of the entire network . They are very active traders with average 14.2 purchases and 55.83 sales . They sold more than they bought . Also note users in the SCC dealt with each other directly or indirectly . Users in the IN component are also very active . They are more likely to be pure sellers , since they made 63.84 sales while only 0.42 purchases on average . Users in the OUT component are casual buyers , who made 6.48 purchase and only 0.21 sales on average . Users in the Tendrils and Tubes are even less active . They only dealt with users of the IN and OUT , but not the SCC . Those in the Disconnected component did only few transactions . Moreover , users in the SCC and IN have the highest average feedback scores and are more trusted than those in other components . Surprisingly , users in the Tube have relatively high feedback scores . These are experienced users . They did not do many transactions , but traded with trusted sellers and buyers .
5.1 Shapes of Categories
We also compared the bow tie shape of different categories . Fig 5 illustrates the size of each component of 32 top level categories and the entire eBay network . Since the SCC contains active buyers and sellers , the size of the SCC can indicate the size of active community in a network . The average SCC size in percentage is 0.61 % , and the standard deviation is 08 % The categories with relatively larger SCC ( more than one standard deviation larger than the average ) are Stamps , Sports Cards , Collectibles , Clothing Shoes & Accessories , Dolls & Bears , Crafts , and Toys & Hobbies . These are more like collector networks . The five categories with the smallest SCC are Specialty Services , Live Auctions , Travel , Consumer Electronics and Real Estate . These categories either have large Tendrils or Disconnected components . Specialty Services , Live Auction and Travel are very small in terms of the network size . Consumer Electronics and Real Estate have very large sellers and are more like retail networks as we discussed in the previous sections .
As we discussed , the IN and the OUT components contain active sellers and casual buyers , respectively . The ratio of the OUT component size over the IN component size tells how unsymmetrical the bow ties structure is . A large OUT IN ratio indicates a large group of casual buyers or a few dominant sellers . In other words , the demand might be much higher than the supply . For all the categories , the average OUT IN ratio is 7.25 with a standard deviation of 625 The categories with the largest OUT IN ratios are Everything Else ( 30.0 ) , Home & Garden ( 20.4 ) and Health & Beauty ( 155 ) Large sellers are more dominant in these categories . In Baby , Stamps , Specialty Services , Travel and Live Auctions , the IN component are larger than the OUT component . Thus , sellers are more diverse in these categories .
The SCC components of individual categories are much smaller than the SCC of the entire network . Fig 6 illustrates the average component sizes of the individual categories comparing to those of the entire eBay network . The SCC , IN and OUT components of the entire network are aggregations of the corresponding components in the subnetworks . When two sub networks are merged , the new SCC is at least the union of those two SCCs if they intersect with each other . In addition , vertices in the IN and OUT components can also become part of the SCC . Therefore , the percentage of the SCC of the entire network increases as shown in Fig 6 . The global Tendrils component is much less significant than those of the individual categories . Since the IN component did not increase a lot , we can say that most vertices move from the Tendrils into the OUT component . In other words , a casual user in the Tendrils of one category is likely to be active buyers rather than top sellers in other categories . 6 . LOCAL STRUCTURES
The degree distribution and the bow tie structure analysis reveal the macroscopic shape of the eBay network . Local network structures are also interesting in characterizing interactions between individuals . However , because of the nature of the complex eBay network , we are interested in the finding recurring small connected sub networks in the network rather than studying a particular interaction or user . One useful measure is the significance profiles of the subnetworks [ 16 ] . The significance Zi of a sub network i in a complex network is computed by comparing its appearances in a real network to that in randomly generated networks with the same degree distribution , ie ,
Zi = ( N reali− < N randi >)/std(N randi )
( 1 ) where N reali is the count of appearances of the sub network i in the real network , and < N randi > and std(N randi ) are the mean and standard deviation of its appearances in the randomly generated networks . The significance profile ( SP ) is the normalized vector of Zi :
.
SPi = Zi/(
1/2
Z 2 j )
( 2 )
In this paper , we computed the triad significance profiles ( TSP ) , which are the significances of all the 13 possible directed connected triads [ 16 ] . To compute the SP for an

Note , in the network of the Java forum , an edge starts from a asker to a replier , which is opposite to how we formulate the eBay network ( ie , from sellers to buyers ) . To be comparable to our results , we swapped the IN and OUT components of the bow tie structure reported in [ 27 ] .

Average feedback scores , average sales and purchases of users in each component are also shown . Total Purchase( % ) and Total Sale( % ) denote the percentage of purchases and sales of users in a particular component to the total purchases and sales in the entire network , respectively . The users in the SCC and IN component are much more trusted than those in other components . The users in the SCC component are active in both selling and buying . The users in the IN component are active sellers , while those in the OUT component are mainly casual buyers .

660 Figure 7 : TSP for Baby , Dolls & Bears , DVD & Movies , Stamps , Crafts and Consumer Electronics . All categories except Baby show similar patterns , in which triad 7 , 9 , and 10 are strong . The triad 7 , feedforward loop , is the most significant one in our networks . It suggests one typical type of interactions among three eBay users , ie , two buyers buy from the same seller , and one of them sells to the other . The triad 10 suggests that two sellers sell to the same buyer and trade with each other . Triad 9 , which indicates that two buyers buy from the same seller and trade with each other , is always less significant than 10 . In other words , there are less interactions among buyers than those among sellers .
661 n node sub network , all the n node sub networks in a network need to be numerated , which is computationally intensive with time complexity of O(|V |n ) . Fast sampling algorithms have been proposed [ 12 , 24 ] . In our experiment , we used FANMOD [ 25 ] , a fast network motif detection tool developed based on [ 24 ] . However , it is still computationally infeasible to search motifs in a network with millions of nodes . On a machine with two AMD Opteron 885 , 2.6 GHz Dual Core Processors and 64 GB of Ram , searching for TSP on a network with 683 , 343 nodes took around 17 hours . Our sample network contains more than 14 million nodes , and even sub networks of categories can contain millions of nodes . Therefore , we were only able to compute the TSP for several relatively small categories , including Baby , Dolls & Bears , DVD & Movies , Stamps , Crafts and Consumer Electronics . The results are depicted in Fig 7 .
We can see that all categories except Baby show similar patterns , in which triad 7 , 9 and 10 are strong . These significant connected sub networks are termed “ network motifs ” [ 17 ] . Motifs can be thought of as essential building blocks of complex networks . The triad 7 , feed forward loop , is the most significant one in our networks . It suggests one typical type of interactions among three eBay users , ie , two buyers buy from the same seller , and one of them sell to the other . The sub network of Baby has very strong triad 10 , but insignificant triad 7 . The triad 10 suggests that two sellers sell to the same buyer and trade with each other . Triad 9 , which indicates that two buyers buy from the same seller and trade with each other , is always less significant than 10 . In other words , there are less interactions among buyers than those among sellers . Among the super families studied in [ 16 ] , the eBay networks are more similar to the biological information processing networks that are not rated limited , rather than social networks and the Web .
In addition , we incorporated semantic information into the motifs . Vertices are colored by corresponding users’ feedback scores . Triads with the same linking structure , but different coloring of vertices are considered different . In this experiment , we divided the continuous feedback scores into 9 ranges and colored the vertices accordingly . We searched for 4 node colored motifs in the Stamps and Antiques categories . The top 10 motifs of these categories are illustrated in Fig 8 .
The most significant motif in Stamps suggests that a large number of top tier sellers sell to second tier sellers as also to casual buyers to whom the second tier sellers also sell . The most significant motif in Antiques suggests that a large number of top tier sellers buy from second tier sellers and sell to casual buyers . The difference is that in Stamps casual buyers often buy from both the top tier and the second tier sellers , while in Antiques , buyers tend to deal with the toptier sellers .
7 . PREFERENTIAL CONNECTIONS
In social networks , people with many connections tend to know others also with many connections . Feedback scores play an important role in transactions on eBay . Therefore , we are interested in users’ tendency to deal with others with respect of their feedback scores . Do users with high feedback scores tend to deal with ones that also have high feedback scores ? Assortative mixing is introduced by Mark Newman to show the extent to which nodes connect preferentially
Figure 8 : Colored Motifs for the Stamps and Antiques category . The color of a node indicate a user ’s feedback score , varies from −1 ( red ) to > 5000(purple ) . The most significant motif in Stamps suggests that a large number of top tier sellers sell to second tier sellers as also to casual buyers to whom the second tier sellers also sell . The most significant motif in Antiques suggests that a large number of top tier sellers buy from second tier sellers and sell to casual buyers . to other nodes with similar characteristics . Social networks often show positive assortativity [ 18 ] .
We plotted the aggregated correlation between sellers’ feedback scores and buyers’ feedback scores ( See Fig 9 ) . The x axis denotes sellers’ feedback scores , and the y axis denotes buyers’ feedback scores . Both axes are logarithmically binned . The color of each block is determined by the number of transactions happened between pairs of users with corresponding feedback scores . We name this Auroral diagrams1 . Fig 9 shows that most transactions happened between the buyers with feedback within [ 0 , 300 ] and the sellers with feedback within [ 150 , 5000 ] . Sellers with feedback close to 0 only made a few sales , while buyers with feedback close to 0 made a lot of purchases . This suggests that it is much easier for new buyers to “ survive ” in this network than for new sellers . Buyers with negative feedbacks made very few transactions indicating their vulnerability in this network .
The preferential connections of Crafts , Collectibles and Computer & Networking are also compared using Auroral diagrams ( See Fig 10 ) . The auroral shape of Crafts and Collectibles are similar to each other , while the auroral shape of Computer & Networking is squeezed . In Crafts and Col
1Our choice of the term “ Auroral Diagram ” is motivated by Auroras which are natural colored light displays observed in the polar zone in the night sky [ 1 ] . These are caused by the collisions of charged particles in the magnetosphere with atoms in the Earth ’s upper atmosphere . The light is caused by the gained energy in these interactions . We draw parallels between this process and preferential interactions between buyers and sellers in our network .

The color of each block is determined by the number of transactions happened between pairs of users with corresponding feedback scores . lectibles , the trusted sellers do much better than those less trusted ones . In Computer & Networking , sellers with a wider range of feedback scores achieve high volume sales .
8 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK In summary , we studied an e commerce network using the transaction data of the eBay Marketplace . Both the macroscopic and microscopic structures of the network are analyzed to reveal the nature of structure and interactions in it . First , we studied the overall structures by the degree distributions and bow tie models . The eBay network shows characteristics different from the Web , but similar to the online Java forum . Its shape is an unsymmetrical bow tie structure . Next , the local structures of selected categories were studied by comparing their TSPs . The results reveal that there are more interactions between sellers than buyers . In order to study the local structure with respect to users’ reputation , 4 node motifs colored by users’ feedback scores were compared for two selected categories . Moreover , the preferential connections of the entire network and individual categories were analyzed using the Auroral diagrams of feedback scores .
As we know , this is the first , yet significant , step to measure an e commerce network . Future work on this network analysis holds promising possibilities . First , we have showed different categories varies from collector networks to retail networks . More in depth analysis of these two types of networks can be very helpful for suggesting effective eBay policies in different categories . In our degree distribution analysis , we did a simple linear regression fit for the power law distributions . More reliable techniques introduced in [ 7 ] will be applied in the future . In addition , we would like to study how the e commerce networks evolve by studying the changing structural patterns over a longer period of time . Network analysis can also be used to understand viability and evolution of micro markets ; fraud detection [ 20 ] ; design better reputation systems and build novel end user social applications . We plan to continue research in these areas based upon this work .
