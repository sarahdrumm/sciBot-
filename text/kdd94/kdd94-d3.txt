Abstract
The Key Findings Reporter ( KEFIlt ) is a system for discovering and explaining ~key findings" in large , relational databases . This paper describes an application of KEFIlt to the analysis of health care information . The system performs an automatic analysis of data along multiple dimensions to determine the most interesting deviations of specific quantitative measures relative to norms and previous values . It explains key findings through their relationship to other findings in the data , and , where possible , generates simple recommendations for correcting detected problems . A final written report , complete with business graphics , is produced for viewing remotely over the internet with Mosaic , or for printing to hardcopy .

The Problem : Rising Health Care Costs
Health care costs in the US have been rising at three times the rate of inflation over the past 10 years . This has weakened US competitiveness in the global market because of the relatively higher cost of health care as compared to other countries . 1 Health care costs now represent about 50~ of corporate net profits . For our company , GTE , health care costs in 1994 will be approximately $700 million dollars~ or about $5,000 per employee . In efforts to control this escalating problem , large employers have invested millions of dollars in information systems for recording and reporting on health care costs . In turn , medical information companies have sprung up to service this need and to provide expert health care analysis .
Expert analysis of health care data is time consuming and very expensive . A single report may take weeks or months to prepare and can cost tens of thousands of dollars . For large corporations , which typically order many reports for different business units , health care consulting costs may run into millions of dollars per year . The great time and expense of preparing a report acts as a disincentive to ordering them in many cases , thus eliminating potential savings opportunities . Even when a report is ordered , it may be incomplete because an exhaustive search of possible findings and their explanations is simply infeasible by manual means . Later we will give an example where human experts overlooked an important finding detected by Health KEFIR .

Health Care Management Data Analysis such as Averagehospitalpaymentsper_capita
Current approaches to health care data analysis rely on a set of relatively , Admission_rate sures or indicators per_10:00.1)eople , and Cesarean:section_rate [ McNeill , 1993 ] . These measures assess various upects of health care , including cost , price , usage , and quality . Measures are often related by formulas to other measures , for example , Admission_rate,per_lO00 = Admissions * 1000 / Number,of_covered . National , regional , and other norms axe routinely compiled for many of these measures to serve as references for judging quality and performance . standard mea
Measures are typically aggregate values taken over populations of individuals . For a corthose poration , the primary population of interest for which the company provides health care coverage . Various sub populations individuals of this group are also of interest to the company , such as separate business units , national regions , union vs . non union employees , etc . From the health care side , sub populations of interest are defined in terms of standard categories , such as Inpatient/Outpatient , Inpatient Admission Type ( medical , surgical , Diagnostic Related Group ( DRG ) . etc. ) , Major Diagnostic Category ( MDC ) , is its employees and their dependents , ie
A fundamental question in health care analysis is : For a given population , how do the standard measures compare to previous values and to normative or expected values ? If a measure for the population has changed dramatically or deviates significantly from the norm , then this represents a potentially interesting finding . Additional factors in determining how interesting a finding is include its impact on the bottom line ( ie how much it costs
11n the US , health care costs consume a larger share of the manufacturing cost of a car than does steel .

KDD 94 the significance of the finding ( eg is it due to chance? ) , the company in dollars ) , important whether there are potential intervention strategies . This last factor is particularly reduce because it identifies where a health care manager can achieve real improvements , ie in costs for normal pregnancies cost and/or improve quality . For example , a 10 % increase would be less interesting in costs for problem newborns , since wellknown intervention methods exist for earlyprenatal care . The interestingness of deviations is examined ]n detail in [ Piatetsky Shapiro and Matheus , 1994 ] . than a 10 % increase
In addition to uncovering the significant findings , the analyst needs to explain them to the extent possible given the data and the analyst ’s knowledge of the health care field . The standard procedure for explaining a high level finding is to "drill down" into the data . In this technique , the cause of a finding is traced to either other significant deviations in smaller sub populations , or to other measures thnt drive the calculation of the first finding . This pro0vss progresses i n a top down fashion , starting with the entire population at the top level and drilling down into smaller and smaller populations until no more significant events are found . The key findings and their explanations are then compiled into a summary report along with recommendations for courses of action .
The task of deviation detection and knowledge based drill down is well suited for automation . A similar task is performed by Spotlight [ Anand and Kahn , 1992 ] and CoverStory [ Schmitz et al . , 1990 ] , two products for identifying and reporting on trends and exceptional events in supermarket sales databases . The goal of our work is to apply some of the same techniques in the much richer context of health care in order to identify ways of reducing GTE ’s health care costs and improving the quality of care to its employees .

The KEFIR System
KEFIR is a domain independent system for discovering and explaining key findings in large , relational databases . Its design models the analytic process employed by the health care analysts we have consulted with . The driving premise of the system is that many of the most interesting patterns to be found in health care databases can he described as deviations . A deviation , in our use of the term , is a difference between an observed value and a reference value . The observed value is always the current value for a measure in a specified population , and it is always represented as a single numeric figure . The reference value can be of various sorts , A deviation over time occurs when the reference is from a previous quarter or year . A standard norm can serve as the reference value in a "normative deviation." Alternatively , a model could generate an expected prediction for the reference value to create a "deviation from expectation."
Deviations are powerful because they provide a simple way of identifying interesting in the data . We have studied many knowledge discovery algorithms with potential patterns for identifying vast numbers of significant patterns from data , but most of these are unable to determine when a pattern is truly interesting to the user [ Matheus et al . , 1993 ] . With deviations we have a Simple way to identify things that differ from our expectations since they differ from what we expect , they are by definition interesting at least to some degree . A complete discovery system requires more than simple deviation detection . Typically the number of detected deviations can be quite large , and so we need a mechanism for

Database
Figure 1 : Overall design and process flow within KEFIR . ordering and selecting the most important ones for reporting . Furthermore , a deviation alone is often unsatisfying without some explanation for why it occurred . In the area of health care at least , an analysis is incomplete without some recommendations for how to remed7 the problems represented by the discovered deviations .
KEFIR performs all four of these tasks : deviation detection , evaluation , explanation , in and recommendation . The overall design and process flow of the system is depicted from the experts are Figure 1 . Raw data from a database and domain knowledge extracted the two sources of input . The system calculates relevant deviations , evaluates and orders them according to their degree of salience , generates explanations for the most important deviations , is a written report with text , tables , and charts . and recommends courses of actions where appropriate . The final result
4.1 Deviation Detection The deviations that KEFIR explores are completely specified by predefined measures and by predefined categories used to create sub populations . We refer to a population ( or subpopulation ) as a sector , with the "top sector ~ representing the entire population covered by the data . KEFIR begins its analysis by evaluating the trend and normative deviations of all the measures relevant to the top sector . New sectors are then created for each of the partitions defined by all relevant categories , and deviations are calculated for each measure in each of these new sectors . This drill down into smaller and smaller populations continues recursively until a pre specified depth is reached or the size of a population becomes inconsequential . The result of this detection process is several hundred to several thousand deviations .

Deviations are encoded in KEFIR within structures we call findings . Each finding stores information for a single measure within a single sector . Both the trend and normative deviations are stored within the finding structure . Additional information is also maintained regarding the the impactof the finding , its relation to other findings ( for use in explanation ) , references to relevant measure and sector information , and miscellaneous book keeping data .
4.2 Ordering Deviations
After the deviations are calculated , they are ordered in preparation for selecting the key findings to include in the final report . This ranking requires A metric for calculating the relative salience or importance of a deviation . The metric used by Health KEFIg incorporates two principal factors : the impact of a deviation and the "probability of success" associated with the finding ’s recommendation .
The impact of a deviation is its estimated contribution to the total payments made in the top sector . We often refer to this as the "bottom line impact" because it is an estimate in dollars of how much the deviation is potentially costing the company . This is particularly evident with normative deviations in which case the impact represents the savings that could have been achieved had the value been equal to the expected norm . These potential savings , which are of great interest to health care managers , appear in portions of the finished report ( see appendix ) .
A recommendation ’s probability of success , as specified by the health care expert , is an estimate of how likely the recommendation ’s action is to bring the measure back to the norm . This probability is multiplied.by the impact to derive a prediction for how much money can be saved if the action is followed . It is this "potential savings" that defines the relative measure of salience used in ranking the list of findings ( see [ Piatetsky Shapiro and Matheus , 1994 ] for more details on this process ) , The top N findings are then selected as key findings for inclusion in the final report . The value N is set to a minimum of five but can increase depending upon the data . The structure of the final report is such that we always want to report on at least five sectors from inpatient and outpatient care , and so N is increased until this is achieved .
4.3 ¯ Explanation
KEFIR generates explanations for all its key findings . An explanation for a given finding can come from the decomposition of a formula that defines the finding ’s measure , or from the breakdown of the measure into its values from the sub sectors derived from the finding ’s sector . The decomposition of a measure by formulas is shown in Figure 2 . In this example , the measure Total_payments can he decomposed by three different in these formulas are drivers of the Total.payments measure since a change in any one directly affects a change in the value of Totalpayments Using this knowledge , we can begin to explain an observed deviation in Total.payments by relating it to the factor most responsible . formulas . The factors is illustrated

KEFIR explains a key finding by first evaluating all other findings affecting it through formulas or breakdowns . It then selects influence and attempts to explain it in the same manner . This recursive process continues until there are no more interesting findings to explain . The final result is a sequence of explanations that chain together a set of interesting findings . the one finding with the greatest

Recommendation
The main purpose for reporting the key findings is so something can be done to improve the delivery of health care . In many cases , the information provided by a finding is sufficient for the system to automatically suggest an appropriate course of action for handling the problem . Health KFFIR uses a set of rules to identify these situations and to generate recommended actions . The following is the content of a simple recommendation rule :
IF measure = In_adms_per_lO00 k sector = Catastrophic percent_change > 0.10 increase

4.5 Report Generation
The final output from ](FJ~IR is a written report of the key findings , their explanations , and recommendations . Sentences and paragraphs are generated using simple template matching , with randomized variations to produce more natural sounding text . Descriptive information ¯ relevant to the findings also appears in the report in the form of tables , bar charts , and pie charts . To facilitate generation of output appropriate for various word processors and presentation is produced of the report ’s unformatted content . Formatted sample output for portions of a report generated by Health KEFIR appears in the appendix . toolS , an intermediate file

The Application in td [ Ousterhout , 1990 ] and C/C++ , in order to make it portable KEFIR was written entirely to virtually all computer platforms . The system ’s access to data is implemented through an SQL interface which ensures conformance to a wide range of database servers . We are currently running the system on a SPARCstation 10 with an Informix DBMS ; we plan a wider deployment on 486 PC ’s accessing several gigabytes from an Oracle server . The design and development of KEFIR required approximately one man year . Another four manmonths went into the knowledge engineering required to construct the knowledge base for Healtla KFFIR The bulk of this knowledge is represented in a collection of instances of base sectors , categories , and measures . Figure 4 shows parts of the structure definitions for typical instances of a sector , category , and measure . ltealth KEFIR performs its analysis on a central workstation , but it makes its results available ( graphic interchange file ) pertext remotely by creating a collection of HTML ( hypertext markup language ) and GIF files and serving these over the network using NCSA ’s httpd ( hytransfer protocol ) server .

Benefits
Much of the time and money corporations spend for health care analysis is focused on processing the data , quality control , and relatively simple descriptive reporting . Most of this analysis amounts to no more than counting andsorting functions , with precious little attention given to sophisticated analysis or to good consulting advice on recommendations for interventions . Heal~h KEFIR can supplant the "manual" traditional that are produced by benefits consulting and health care information firms . This automation will reduce data analysis costs by huge amounts , and should provide a solid foundation for health care consultants to analyze and interpret the resulting information . reports
In addition to price advantages and better deployment of scarce resources , there are also speed advantages . The typical report may take several weeks to complete manually with Health KEFIR these reports can be donein a few hours . This permits a more timely response to discovered problems . It also increases the manager ’s willingness to request reports that would have otherwise been too expensive to justify or to long in preparation to be of use . important in a large , complex company like GTE where there are so This is particularly many organizational subgroups ( combinations of business units , geography , union vs nonunion employees , etc’ ) which cannot receive dedicated attention because of resource scarcity . Health KEFIR expands the scope of analyses by making it feasible to produce more of these reports for a wider range of study groups .
Health KEFIR also promises to improve the accuracy and completeness of reports . The system is not prone to human error , and it can perform a more thorough search than a human expert would have the time or patience for . Human experts typically execute a toplevel drill down , following paths that continue to show promise , while pruning most others for lack of time . Health KEFIR can perform an exhaustive search of all paths through the data to ensure that it does not miss any significant findings . We have observe this kind of thing in practice . In one of its early reports , Health KEFIR identified an important key finding concerning an excessively high re admission rate for surgical patients this finding was missing from a report On the same study group submitted by a respectable consulting firm . reduce production
In summary , Health KEFIR promises to lower costs , time , improve accuracy/completeness , and increase coverage of possible study groups . Its early use here at GTE supports these clairnsl I More reports are being generated on a wider range of study groups than was previously possible . The cost per report is infinitesimal compared to the $10,000 plus price tag of a consultant ’s report , and the turn around time has been on the order of a day or less . The savings to GTE on report generation costs alone are anticipated to be on the order of several hundred thousand dollars in 1994 . Other benefits , such as savings from earlier the consultant firms might have missed , are intervention or from discoveries

The market for a Health KEFIR system is enormous , In a company like GTE , the analytic cost savings .are estimated at 25 % of total health care information costs . Perhaps of more importance is the market of small and medium size employers which has never been penetrated because of the fixed initial costs .

Limitations and Extensions
The performance of Health KEFIR is only as good as its domain knowledge . We are adding to its rule base to broaden and improve its recommendation capabilities . New categories and measures are being added to reflect changes in the way health care managers want to aggregate and decompose information . The weights on measures and sectors are fine tuned as required to meet the expectations of the managers the automation of this process through the use of a ]earning algorithm is an anticipated future extension . it will be possible
Currently the system only handles simple trend and normative analysis . We would like to extend its capabilities to include trend analysis over multiple periods , and add modelto modify the based comparisons . With longer range trend analysis salience of a measure to reflect the importance of a constant trend towards or away from the norm . For example , if a measure compares favorably with the current norm but has been steadily increasing while the norm has remained reality constant , this may be a cause for attention which the current system would miss . While norms are useful references for average performance , it is often desirable to set other targets for comparison . For example , rather than comparisons to the average it has been argued that comparisons should be made to a "i~est practice" model , ie comparison to a target representing an achievable level of above average , performance . In some situations unusual circumstances may make even the average unachievable , in which case we might wish to set sights on some target below the norm . To accommodate these forms of analysis and tracking , Health KEFIR will need to be able to use models to represent deviation reference values . to accurately measure a finding ’s relative salience .
As the complexity of Health KEFIR advances to meet the complexity of the domain , it In the current becomes more difficult implementation the salience function is a rather simple combination of trend and normative impacts multiplied by the measure and sector weights . We have considered alternative functions that can account for trend directions or involve more complicated interaction between impacts , but making these fit the experts’ knowledge has been challenging . Adding more forms of deviations to a finding will certainty add to the salience function ’s complexity .
Another information product that KeFiR may provide , which is new to the health care information market , is an "early warning report" . This report would monitor many key indicators over many subgroups and would flag variations from expected levels , for further study by benefits managers . This Capability , along with other more interactive extensions , are being explored for the next version of Health KEFIR .

8 Conclusions
KF , FIR is a system for rapidly developing discovery applications implementation of Health KFA~IR and/or normative analysis is appropriate . The successful demonstrates the merits of the system and the potential power of the deviation methodology . This technology has matured to a point where wider application to other domains is now feasible and desirable . Within GTE , systems for analyzing data in the areas of marketing , customer support , and telephone operations are being considered . in domains where trend
