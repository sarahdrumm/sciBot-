This paper presents an algorithm for discovering conjunction rules with high reliability from data sets . The discovery of conjunction rules , each of which is a restricted is well motivated by various useflll applications such as semantic query optimization and automatic development of a knowledge base . In a discovery algorithm , a production rule is evaluated according to its generality and accuracy since these are widely accepted as criteria in learning evaluation for these from examples . Here , reliability criteria rules from unreliable patterns without annoying the users . However , previous discovery approaches have either ignored reliability evaluation or have only evaluated the reliability of generality , and consequently , tend to discover a huge number of rules . In order to circumvent these difficulties we propose an approach based on a simultaneous estimation . Our approach discovers the rules that exceed pre specified thresholds for generality and accuracy with high reliability . A novel pruning method is employed for improving time efficiency without changing the discovery outcome . The proposed approach has been validated experimentally using 21 benchmark data sets from the UCI repository . reliable
Introduction topics relatives a conjunction rules and their the most important in KDD due to rule
The discovery of production is one of its generality . Among the relatives , ( Smyth & Goodman 1992 ) , in which A and B represent a conjunction of atoms and a single atom respecrule ( Agrawal et aI . 1996 ) , in tively , and an association which A and B represent a set of examples and every is binary , are considered as the most imporattribute is well motitant . The discovery of conjunction vated by various useful applications such as semantic ( Hsu ~ Knoblock 1996 ) and auquery optimization tomatic of a knowledge base Goodman 1992 ) . development

Here , and are probabilities estimated to the size of a database and to therefore indifferent careful the reliability examination for the interestingness in order to keep the number of discovered rules as small as possible , since a huge number of rules can be discovered from a database . A precise evaluation of reliability would considerably for checking number of rules with high reliability in this case .

Description of the Problem
Let an example ei be a description stored in a data set in the form of a record , set contains n examples el , e2," ,en . is represented ail,ai2,’",o4m Here , continuous cretized about an object then a data An example ei aim > where attributes . to be disusing an existing method such as ( Dougherty by a tuple < all , a~ , , are values for m discrete attributes are supposed
KDD 98 339 et al . 1995 ; Fayyad gz Irani 1993 ) . An event representing , in propositional form , a single value assignment to an attribute will be called an atom .
A conjunction rule ( Smyth & Goodman 1992 ) r(# ) is a production rule which represents a probabilistic correlation or causality between its premise and conclusion , and is represented by r(p ) = A~ , ~ c ,
At‘ = alAa2A’Aa~ ,
( 1 ) ( 2 ) where at and c are single atoms . In this paper , we consider the problem of finding a set of conjunction rules from a data set .
In learning from examples , generality and accuracy are considered as the most general criteria for evaluating the goodness of a hypothesis . In case of a conjunction rule At‘ 4 c , these two criteria correspond to the point estimated probabilities/3(A~ ) and t3(c[At , ) respectively
( Smyth & Goodman 1992 ) . t~xisting methods for evaluating the generality and the accuracy of a production rule can be classified into two approaches : the single expression approach such as ( K16sgen 1996 ; Smyth & Goodman 1992 ) which assumes a single criterion defined by a combination of two criteria , and the simultaneous approach such as ( Agrawal et al . 1996 ) which specifies threshold for each criterion . a minimum
Besides , several methods have been proposed to evaluate the reliability of generality ( Agrawal et al . 1996 ; Chan 8z Wong 1991 ; Siebes 1994 ) , which estimate the true probability p(Ag ) of the premise . These methods can be employed for a modified version of the simultaneous approach : specify a minimum threshold for p(Ag ) with some confidence level and another minimum threshold for ~(clA~ , ) . Note that a smaller number of rules are discovered in this modified version since the lower bound of the true probability p(Au ) is smaller titan/~(A/, ) .
We take the simultaneous approach due to its generality , and for a more detailed evaluation of a rule , consider both the reliability of its generality and the reliability of its accuracy . We discover the rules v(/z ) which true probabilities p(Ag ) and p(c]A~ , ) are greater than or equal to their respective minimum thresholds Os , 0~ , with a confidence level 1 ~ .

Evaluation Previous Methods In KDD , the Chernoff bound is frequently used in assessing the reliability of a discovered production rule ( Agrawal et al . 1996 ; Siebes 1994 ) . Consider the problem of estimating the true probability p of an atom from a data set . Let the probability obtained by point estimation be/3 , and ln(x ) be the natural logarithm x . Then according to the theorenh the 1 d confidence
340 Suzuki interval for the probability p is given as follows ( Siebes 1994 ) .

This problem , however , can be also resolved by the normal approximations of the binomial distributions . Let a~ satisfy
~Tr a6 exp
( % d~ = 1 ~ .
( 5 )
Then the confidence interval is given by
Note that ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) are for estimating a single probability . Therefore , neither ( 4 ) nor ( 6 ) are quate for our problem since ( 3 ) contains a conditional probability . of the

Since an expression on the left hand side in ( 18 ) or ( 19 ) being a constant represents a line , the maximum and the minimum of each expression occur at the extremes of the ellipse . Let A be an undetermined multiplier , then according to the Lagrange ’s multiplier method , an extremum of an expression f under g = 0 satisfy
Let g be the ellipse in ( 17 ) , and fl and f= be the expression on the left hand side in ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) respectively . Appling ( 20 ) for f = fl and f = f2 , we obtain

Similarly , we can show that ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) also hold 3 i ~(Di ) = 0 . Therefore , we obtain a set of conjunction rules each of which satisfies ( 21 ) and ( 22 ) .
Discovery Algorithm
In our algorithm , a discovery task is viewed as a search problem , in which a node of a search tree represents a conjunction rule r(/z ) . Let tt : 0 represents the state in which the premise of a rule r(tt ) contains no atoms , then we define that tt = 0 holds in a node of depth 1 , and as the depth increases by 1 , an atom is added to the premise .
In rule discovery , we often discover similar rules Au 4 c and A{ 4 c , where A~ . is a specialization of Au . For an easy interpretatmn of the results , a rule Au + c is not outputted if i6(c[A~ ) </5(c[Au ) . such

Application to Data Sets
The proposed method was tested with data sets from several domains , including 21 benchmark data sets ( Merz et al . 1996 ) in the machine learning community . is discretized
We have compared our method with the previous methods , where the parameters were set to M = 3 , 5 0.05 , 9s = 0.1 and 8F = 09 In the experiments , a continuous attribute in advance by ( Fayyad & Irani 1993 ) . Figure 1 shows the ratio of the number of discovered rules between the three approaches and evaluation . A bullet the approach without reliability ( . ) , a times ( x ) and a triangle ( A ) correspond approach , the approach based on the Chernoff bound and the approach based on the normal approximations of the binomial distributions respectively . In the figure , the number of rules discovered a bar chart represents by the approach without reliability evaluation in a logarithmic scale , and data sets , which are shown along the horizontal axe , are sorted with respect to these numbers .
From figure 1 , we note that the proposed approach in many data reduces a considerable number of rules In the sets compared with the previous approaches . "german" data set , for example , it reduces 88 % and 81 % of the rules compared with the approach based on the normal approximations of the binomial distributions and with the approach based on the Chernoff bound respectively . Since 2,352 rules are discovered by
KDD 98 341 the no evaluation approach from this data set , the proposed method is effective in reducing the user ’s effort of verifying the discovered rules . Same conclusion can be obtained from the experiments with the "satellite" data set , in which the proposed method reduces more than 51,128 rules compared with the other methods . The proposed method , since it evaluates more information than the other methods , reduces a larger number of rules or at least the same number of rules . It reduces only a small fraction of rules in the "nursery" and "shuttle" data set , the reason of which is difficult to be explained since it concerns the distribution of the attribute values in the data sets . A simple explanation is that these data sets have a small number of rules with low reliability to be reduced since the numbers of attributes are relatively small ( at most 10 ) and the numbers of examples are large ( at least 12,960 ) . However , such a data set , which has a large number of examples and a small number of attributes tribute values , is considered to be rare in KDD . and at
In the three algorithms presented in the previous experiments , discovery is regarded as a search problem , and its execution time is known to be approximately propositional to the number of searched nodes . Figure 2 shows the ratio of the number of searched nodes between the three approaches and the approach without reliability evaluation . To be fair , we have derived stopping criteria which correspond to theorem 1 for every method , and have employed them in the experiments .
From figure 2 , we note that the proposed approach reduces a considerable number of nodes in many data sets compared with the previous approaches . In the "satellite" data set , for example , it reduces 80 % and 77 % of the nodes compared with the approach based on the normal approximations of the binomial distributions and with the approach based on the Chernoff bound respectively . it than the other methods , evaluates more information reduces a larger number of nodes or at least the same number of nodes . The effectiveness of the approach , however , is difficult plicatedly with the probability distribution of the attribute values in the data set .
The proposed method , since to be analyzed since it relates com
From the above experiments , the proposed approach is superior to or at least as effective as the existing approaches in terms of filtering out less reliable rules and pruning the searched nodes . We can safely conclude that our approach reduces both the user ’s effort and the computational therefore mandatory for the efficient discovery of reliable rules . time , and is
Conclusion
This paper has described an approach based on a stochastic estimation for discovering rules with high The previous approaches , since they have reliability . neglected reliability evaluation or have only evaluated the reliability of generality , had problems of discovering a huge number of unnecessary rules , causing a consid
342 Suzuki erable overload to their users . Our approach remedies this problem by a simultaneous estimation of the confidence region based on the normal approximations of the multinomial distribution . Consequently , our approach filters out rules with low reliability by evaluating both the reliability of generality and the reliability of accuracy . Moreover , we have derived stopping criteria the discovery results . to improve search efficiency without altering results
The proposed approach has been applied to 21 data ( Merz et al . 1996 ) . Exsets from the UCI repository perimental show that our approach reduces both the number of discovered rules and the number of searched nodes compared with the existing approaches . The proposed approach is especially effective in reliable rule discovery in databases with a large number of attributes and attribute values . Moreover , it would be also effective when the computational time is limited due to its use of newly derived stopping criteria .
