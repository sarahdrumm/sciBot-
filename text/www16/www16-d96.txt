ABSTRACT The QWERTY effect postulates that the keyboard layout influences word meanings by linking positivity to the use of the right hand and negativity to the use of the left hand . For example , previous research has established that words with more right hand letters are rated more positively than words with more left hand letters by human subjects in small scale experiments . In this paper , we perform large scale investigations of the QWERTY effect on the web . Using data from eleven web platforms related to products , movies , books , and videos , we conduct observational tests whether a handmeaning relationship can be found in text interpretations by web users . Furthermore , we investigate whether writing text on the web exhibits the QWERTY effect as well , by analyzing the relationship between the text of online reviews and their star ratings in four additional datasets . Overall , we find robust evidence for the QWERTY effect both at the point of text interpretation ( decoding ) and at the point of text creation ( encoding ) . We also find under which conditions the effect might not hold . Our findings have implications for any algorithmic method aiming to evaluate the meaning of words on the web , including for example semantic or sentiment analysis , and show the existence of ” dactilar onomatopoeias ” that shape the dynamics of word meaning associations . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to reveal the extent to which the QWERTY effect exists in large scale human computer interaction on the web .

INTRODUCTION
What were the body organs that you used the last time that you communicated with someone ? If we asked this strange question 200 years ago , the most likely answer would be : ” my vocal cords ” . With the rise of the web and online communication , we are increasingly more likely to get another

With more than 200 Billion emails sent per day [ 39 ] and textual communication being more frequent than voice calls in mobile phone usage [ 37 ] , there is little doubt that the human computer interface , in particular fingers and keyboards , plays an important role in online communication and the web in general .
The QWERTY effect postulates that the keyboard layout influences word meanings by linking positivity to the use of the right hand and negativity to the use of the left hand . In [ 25 ] for example , Jasmin and Casasanto show that the QWERTY effect1 manifests in offline small scale experiments , as human subjects rated those words more positively that were typed with more letters from the right side of the keyboard than words typed with more letters from the left [ 25 , 6 ] . General lateralization effects explain the existence of the QWERTY effect , including the positive connotation of the right [ 7 ] and the positive effect of fluency that righthanded typers can experience when using the right hand more often .
We measure the tendency to use right side letters through the Right Side Ratio ( RSR ) , calculated as the amount of right side letters divided by the sum of right and left side letters in a text . Figure 1A shows the general pattern of hand usage in the QWERTY layout and an example of how the RSR is calculated . Figure 1B shows the RSR for English books of the Google Books corpus [ 28 ] published each available year since 1900 , illustrating a general upwards trend of this ratio that specially speeds up in the early 1990s . The vertical red bar shows the RSR computed for a corpus of English text on the web [ 24 ] , displaying a higher tendency of right side letters on the web as compared to books . What remains unknown from this preliminary analysis is whether the increasing prevalence of words with a higher RSR on the web translates into evidence for the QWERTY effect .
We thus set out to study whether evidence for ( or against ) In other the QWERTY effect can be found on the web . words , we want to test the hypothesis that textual web content with more right side letters is evaluated more positively by users . In addition , we also want to study boundary conditions of the QWERTY effect on the web , ie the extent to which it can be observed , and its limitations .
Building on existing methods used to analyze small scale experimental data [ 6 ] , we perform a large scale confirmatory analysis to test if the QWERTY effect manifests on the web . We test if the QWERTY effect is present when ( i ) decoding text , ie when evaluating items with names or titles ( eg

The ratio increases with time and has a higher value on the web .
IMDB movie titles ) . For that , we gather eleven datasets of online media , recording how content is evaluated via votes , likes , or ratings . Using that data , we explore the existence of a hand meaning relationship through a series of statistical tests , including permutation tests , robust regression , and control for linguistic and contextual factors that could influence the effect . We also test the QWERTY effect when ( ii ) encoding text , ie when online users write text to express certain meaning ( eg Amazon reviews ) . For that , we analyze four additional datasets of online product reviews that are accompanied by a summary of their evaluative meaning as a star rating . On these datasets , we test the existence of a relationship between star ratings of a review and the amounts of right and left side letters of its text .
We find mostly consistent , significant evidence for the existence of the QWERTY effect across 15 web datasets , both on an encoding and decoding level . More specifically , we find that the ratio of right side letters has a normalized coefficient between 1 and 3 % of the standard deviation of average evaluations given by users , and the amount of left hand letters in a review are associated with decreases of up to 17 % of a star per 100 letters ( more details in Section 4 ) . These apparently small effect sizes are characteristic of psycholinguistic studies , where word frequencies usually variate at the 1 % level [ 20 , 27 ] . We analyze the interaction between these effects and linguistic and contextual variables , finding robust evidence of the effect against a range of plausible confounds . Our analysis also reveals some interesting limitations of the QWERTY effect , which can weaken for popular web content or can even be reversed in the language of very particular contexts . The results reported in this paper are limited to English , and our models are only testable when explicit positive and negative ratings are present .
Our contributions are two fold : ( i ) To the best of our knowledge , this is the first large scale attempt to study the existence of the QWERTY effect on the web . ( ii ) in addition to decoding studies which have been performed by previous research in small scale , offline experiments , we are also testing if the QWERTY effect exists when encoding text . Overall , our contribution lies in the execution of a confirmatory study to test the extent of the QWERTY effect on the web , and its conditionants .
2 . RESEARCH BACKGROUND
The QWERTY effect : The QWERTY effect was first reported in secondary analyses of word rating experiments [ 25 ] , testing the relationship between the valence expressed in a word and its difference between the amounts of right and left side letters in the word . The explanation of the effect existing due to the keyboard is specially consistent , as the effect is stronger for words created after the popularization of the keyboard and even for pseudowords without explicit meaning [ 6 ] . Besides this robust evidence in experimental tests , the state of research on this effect is limited in two ways : First , previous research focused on word interpretation ( decoding ) and did not test the existence of the effect when writing text . Second , results so far only show the existence of the effect in a precise controlled scenario , leaving open whether it appears in practice , for example if products with the ” right ” name have an advantage [ 25 ] . We aim at contributing to our knowledge of the QWERTY effect in a way that complements these two limitations , through a large scale observational analysis of the effect on the web that includes both encoding and decoding scenarios .
The fact that we cannot generally perceive the relationship between hand use and meaning suggests that the effect must be very subtle , difficult to measure with limited data , and easy to distort through experimental biases . One of our aims is to test if the effect exists when encoding , which is difficult to measure in the laboratory , since it would require participants to produce large amounts of text . To date , the only observational evidence of the effect during encoding focuses on baby names , testing if there is a bias towards right side letters when naming newborns . Results for this case are mixed , while there is a general increase of right side letter use in US baby names [ 6 ] , a precise test of a correlation between right side letter use and baby name popularity yields negative results [ 40 ] .
Explanations for the QWERTY effect : How can typing influence word meaning ? Two possible mechanisms can be identified in the literature . First , the fluency experienced when using the right hand and its associated pleasantness can drive right hand typers to use right keys when expressing positivity . Since the majority of society is right handed and

Second , the QWERTY effect could be explained by general lateralization : individuals have implicit biases to associate right to good and left to bad , even across cultures [ 7 ] . In fact , lateralization might be biologically grounded , as experiments with newborn chicken show faster learning rates when positive stimuli are located on the right [ 41 ] . Furthermore , smartphone usage is linked to increased finger sensitivity at the neural level [ 19 ] , motivating the explanation that the QWERTY effect could be built on the combination of biological and technological factors .
Communication of emotion : Among the possible ways to measure meaning , our research question deals with evaluation , formalized for example in the semantic differential [ 32 ] , and commonly named ” valence ” in emotion research [ 33 , 35 ] . The valence associated to a word or a text measures the degree of pleasure or displeasure , the degree of positivity or negativity that the word or text means . The communication of emotions is integrated in a wider perspective in the hyperlens model of emotions , and its composed of two components : ( i ) encoding , in which the transmitter turns emotional meaning into signs , and ( ii ) decoding , when the receiver transforms those signs back into meanings [ 26 ] . In this model , encoding and decoding happen in the presence of individual feedback and social and cultural contexts , considering emotions as interpersonal ( social ) phenomena that are embodied and not only present in the mind . The case of the QWERTY effect is specially interesting for the concept of embodied emotions , since it proposes a fundamental change in emotional communication induced by a physical constraint , the keyboard layout , and not by any cognitive phenomenon .
Expression of sentiment on the web : Online humancomputer interaction has an important transformative power in society [ 12 ] , changing our attitudes [ 34 ] , and leaving traces that allow us to understand human behavior like never before [ 21 ] . Through the digital traces of the web we can learn social dynamics of emotions , for example the daily patterns of emotional expression [ 20 ] , the emergence of collective emotions [ 15 ] , or the spreading of emotional messages [ 2 ] . Fundamental properties of language can also be analyzed this way , for example the existence of positive biases across languages [ 16 , 13 ] , the assortativity of subjective expression [ 3 ] , and the community components of language [ 8 , 5 ] . Analyzing the content of online data has promising applications through sentiment analysis , from monitoring reactions to politically relevant events [ 22 ] to financial trading based on emotional expression [ 4 , 17 ] . Thus , understanding how language might be influenced by technology is not only interesting as a fundamental research question , but has implications for the application of online data analysis . 3 . DECODING STUDY
Our aim is to test the QWERTY effect in a wide variety of settings , including possible variations of language style and communication mechanisms .
Datasets .
To test the effect , we need datasets that contain items ( products , movies , videos , etc ) that are rated in an evaluative manner , with both positive and negative feedback that can be aggregated to a valence score . If only positive feed back or views are present , the question would become about popularity rather than about evaluation . In addition , we need items to be named with a character string that is used to refer to them . For example , product names or movie titles fall on this class , while summaries or question formulations do not constitute symbols that could be affected by the QWERTY effect . Since the scope of this research is to try the QWERTY effect as it has been formulated for the English keyboard layout , we will focus on English speaking online communities and filter out non English data in case of its existence . A summary of these datasets is shown on Table 1 .
Product and business ratings : The first class of datasets we include are general product and business ratings from Amazon.com , Yelp.com , Epinions.com and Dooyoocouk We use the deduplicated Amazon dataset from [ 30 , 29 ] , focusing only on products with complete metadata that includes price and sales rank . This way , we count with more than 4 million rated products . For the case of Yelp , we analyze the Yelp challenge dataset2 , filtering out business from non English speaking locations . As a result , we count with the ratings and names for more than 55 thousand businesses . Data on Epinions and Dooyoo was provided as part of social recommender systems research [ 38 ] , including more than 200 thousand and 100 thousand rated products in Epinions and Dooyoo respectively .
Movie and book ratings : The second class of datasets we include is based on reviews of cultural items like movies or books . First , we downloaded the datasets of the Open Movie DataBase [ 14 ] , which is based on data publicly displayed on IMDB.com and RottenTomatoes.com and has been used in previous research on movies [ 18 ] . For IMDB , we count with the average rating provided by users on a 1 to 10 star scale , and with additional information about the movie including year of release and languages for more than 300 thousand movies . The case of Rotten Tomatoes is smaller but includes more than 80 thousand movies rated by the users of the platform ( we discard professional critic data ) . The third movie dataset we include comes from the MovieLens platform and is publicly available for research 3 , including ratings in a 1 to 5 scale for more than 29 thousand movies . We complete this group of datasets with the BookCrossing dataset [ 43 ] that includes ratings on a 1 to 10 scale for almost 150 thousand books .
Video ratings : The third class of data we analyze are video sharing communities , in which users rate videos with up and down votes , or ” likes ” and ” dislikes ” . We start from one of the largest video sharing communities , Youtube , using a dataset of a large scale crawl of Youtube videos [ 1 ] . To filter out non English videos , we applied language detection [ 9 ] and only included videos with a title identified as English . This includes more than 3 million videos in our analysis with contextual data that contains the upload date and the amounts of views and comments of each video . We replicate this dataset with our own crawl of two adult video communities that have a design very similar to Youtube . Using the sitemaps described in the robots.txt file of these sites , we retrieve the title and upvote ratios , as well as some additional data as in Youtube , including views and upload
2http://wwwyelpcom/dataset_challenge 3http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ date . This adds two more video datasets with more than 300 thousand videos each .
Methods .
Variables : Our approach builds on the methods of [ 25 ] , measuring three relevant types of variables for each item that is evaluated by an online community . First , we compute the Right Side Ratio ( RSR ) of the item ’s name as RSR = R/(R + L ) , where R is the amount of instances of right side letters of the QWERTY keyboard and L of left side letters . Second , we estimate the valence V of the evaluation of the item as provided by the community , by averaging the votes assigned to the item . The way we calculate V depends on the community , for example for IMDB movies we compute the average star rating ( as shown in the example of Figure 1A ) , while for videos we take the ratio of likes over the sum of likes and dislikes . Third , we compute a set of controls to include in our analysis , in order to test possible factors that can increase or diminish the QWERTY effect . We distinguish two types of controls : i ) linguistic controls that can be computed for all datasets , including the amount of letters and words in the name and the average letter and word frequency as computed in the Google books dataset [ 28 ] , and ii ) contextual controls that include communitydependent observable variables such as the amount of views of a video , the year of a movie , or the price of a product .
Statistical tests : In our analysis , the valence of an item is the dependent variable that is hypothesized to increase with the RSR . Thus , our first test is based on a regression model
V = a + b ∗ RSR +
( 1 ) in which the QWERTY effect states the alternative hypothesis b > 0 versus the null hypothesis of b = 0 . This way the right side coefficient b measures the tendency of the valence of items to grow with the RSR of their names . On top of this model , we perform a series of statistical tests . First , we perform traditional Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) and test the significance of the estimate ˆb with the standard Student t test . This test has the advantage of being general and simple , but implies a series of assumptions : normality of , sample independence , and homoskedasticity . We provide additional tests that relax these assumptions and add robustness to our statistical analysis . We perform a permutation test [ 23 ] , in which we compute the same esti mate ˆb over 10000 randomized versions of the data where the names of products have been reshuffled . Furthermore , we perform bootstrap tests over the OLS estimate , using 10000 bootstrap samples with replacement [ 10 ] . Estimating ˆb over these samples , we compute a bootstrap confidence interval to further test the hypothesis of a positive right side coefficient . To cope with heteroskedasticity , we apply an MM type robust regressor [ 42 ] , which controls the leverage of outliers and provides residuals closer to normality than OLS . In addition , we compute Spearman ’s correlation between V and RSR on a bootstrap test , further testing if a positive relation between the RSR and V exists when outliers are linearized into ranks .
Controlling for confounds : The effect size suggested by previous findings is very small but very general , motivating the inclusion of linguistic controls to discard possible confounds with frequency or sample size variables [ 6 ] . To test if our findings can be explained due to confounds or sample biases , we perform an additional test with linear controls . The test works as follows : first , we fit a model of the form
V = ci ∗ Xi + Vr
( 2 ) i
Vr = a
+ b where Xi are a set of control variables . Vr is the residualized valence , ie the remaining valence that cannot be explained by the controls and constitutes the error term of the regression . Then we fit the a model ∗ RSR +
( 3 ) in order to test the hypothesis b > 0 . The control variables depend on the dataset under study , for example for the case of Youtube : X = [ Nw , Nl , Aw , Al , Nr , Nv , Nc , t ] . The linguistic controls are the amount of words Nw , the amount of letters Nl , the average word frequency Aw , and the average letter frequency Al . The contextual controls given by Youtube are the amounts of votes Nr , views Nv , and comments Nc , and the timestamp of creation of the video t . The linguistic controls are common for all our tests , and the contextual controls of each dataset are listed on Table 1 . Besides the residualized regression , we leverage the large size of the Amazon and Youtube datasets to test the general trend of the QWERTY effect , as estimated through the right side coefficient . Using each control variable , we stratify the data into deciles according to each variable and make parallel fits

Bottom : Estimates of the right side coefficient ˆb . The figure shows density functions of bootstrap estimates of the QWERTY effect ( red ) and estimates under permutation ( blue ) . Vertical dashed lines show the mean estimates . The hypothesis of the QWERTY effect is generally confirmed , with the exception of the cases of BookCrossing and Redtube . The estimates under permutation are concentrated around 0 and do not reach the mean point estimates . The distributions of ˆb in bootstrap tests are significantly above 0 in the same cases as in the Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) estimate . over each stratum . We then analyze how the right side coefficient as estimated in Equation 1 might depend on each control variable , to explore the generality of the effect and evaluate the conditions that might weaken or strengthen it .
3.1 The QWERTY effect in decoding text
The hypothesis b > 0 was confirmed in 9 out of the 11 datasets in the t test of the OLS estimate , as shown on the regression functions of the top panel of Figure 2 . The results of bootstrap estimates of the right side coefficient and permutation tests are shown in the bottom panel of Figure 2 , illustrating how the effects revealed by the model vanish under permutation . This shows that our methods do not introduce false positives , as permuted datasets clearly show nonsignificant results with means around 0 . All these 9 cases reach the significant conclusions in the bootstrap , permutation and Spearman tests . As reported in Table 2 , these cases reach the maximum level of statistical significance ( p < 0.05 ) reachable in 10000 samples of the bootstrap , permutation , and Spearman tests .
Our additional robustness test includes an MM type estimator that lowers the influence of outliers . All the cases passing the above tests also pass this test , with the exception of Epinions , which shows no significant results when outliers are corrected ( see Table 2 ) . It is worth noting that in some cases , the size estimate of the right side coefficient ˆb was slightly moderated in robust regression , but it never changes sign .
To compare effect sizes , we performed a normalized version of the OLS test , in which we computed the Z score of each variable . In this comparison , the right side coefficient is measured as a ratio of standard deviations , rather than in the natural units of each case . Figure 3 shows the point estimates of this normalized right side coefficient ˆb and their 95 % confidence intervals . The effect size is the largest in Yelp , followed by Dooyoo , and the estimate is very small for the case of Epinions , in line with the non significant robust regression result . It is interesting to point out that one of the adult video communities , Redtube , displays a reversed effect with negative right side coefficient ( all re

With respect to other controls , the right side coefficient ˆb barely changed with price or amount of reviews available , but showed a clear step function with respect to sales rank . The effect was only present for products with high rank number , which means that they were relatively low in the sales list . It is important to note that the estimates for the best selling products are slightly negative , showing that the effect might be reversed for superstar products and some nonlinearities exist with respect to sales . This observation does not contradict the residualized analysis of Table 2 , as the QWERTY effect is still positive in 7 deciles and it holds for the average product when controlling for sales rank .
4 . ENCODING STUDY
Datasets .
We use four datasets of general product reviews for our encoding study , using the text of reviews and their star ratings on a 1 to 5 scale . The summary of the amount of reviews and aggregate rating at the review level are provided in Table 3 . For Amazon , we leverage the size of the dataset to avoid sampling biases . From the more than 80 million reviews present in the dataset , we randomly select at most one review per product and per user , to ensure that extremely active users or extremely popular products do not bias our statistics .

Methods .
We conduct an incremental regression model of the rating of a review V as a function of text properties . We start from a null model that shows if there is a relation between rating and review length V = al + bl ∗ Nl , testing if splitting the length data into R and L provides a better ( adjusted ) estimate when fitting a model with an interaction effect :
V = aRL + bR ∗ R + bL ∗ L + bRL ∗ R ∗ L
( 4 )
This way we cope with the colinearity of R and L . If the QWERTY effect manifests when encoding a review , the estimates should satisfy bR > 0 and bL < 0 , in a way such that their slopes do not change signs easily in the range of possible values of R and L . We test these hypotheses through t tests , and further verify them through permutation and bootstrapping as in the Decoding Study . 4.1 The QWERTY effect in encoding text
Table 4 shows the regression results for all four datasets . For the cases of Amazon , Yelp , and Dooyoo , the model using R and L values outperforms the length model , increasing the adjusted R2 . The estimates of the coefficients in all
Figure 3 : Summary of the right side coefficient ˆb in decoding text . Dots show point estimates of the normalized linear model , error bars show 95 % confidence intervals . The estimate of the right side coefficient is generally positive and significant , with values up to 3 % of the standard deviation of V . gression results had p < 0.001 and negative point estimates , permutation , bootstrap and Spearman one tailed tests gave p = 1 against b > 0 ) . This suggests that the hand meaning relation does not need to manifest in the same way in all contexts . We provide more details on possible reasons for this phenomenon in the discussion .
Controlling for confounds : The details of the models including controls , ie after residualizing valence as a function of other variables , are provided in Table 2 . All residualized estimates are significant and consistent with the rest of results , with the exception of Epinions . Thus , for the other 8 cases , the results of the other tests cannot be explained as linear confounds with other variables , lending robust evidence for the existence of the QWERTY effect .
To dig deeper in the role of linguistic properties of the names in Youtube and Amazon , we report the stratified analyses of the right side coefficient ˆb depending on each control variable . Figure 4A shows the right side coefficient ˆb for deciles varying control variables in Youtube . A first observation yields a simple conclusion , the QWERTY effect is independent of the amounts of words and letters in the title , as well as of their average frequencies . In addition , the effect does not dramatically change with respect to other controls , including the amount of views of a video , the amount of comments , the total amount of likes and dislikes , nor on the date of the video . Thus we find a strong robustness of the effect in Youtube , even when accounting for sample sizes when controlling for the amount of ratings of a video .
The case of Amazon is more interesting , as shown in Figure 4B , the right side coefficient decreases for longer product names . With respect to frequency , the effect becomes negligible for products with letters and words of very low frequency . This analysis shows that the QWERTY effect in Amazon weakens when infrequent or fabricated language is used in product names , as well as with very long names .

For the case of Epinions , the signs of the estimates are in the predicted direction , but the estimates are not significant . This is probably due to the limited size of the Epinions dataset , and only more data or more powerful statistical methods could provide a final answer .
The interaction effect bRL is positive and significant in two cases . This implies a nonlinearity in the role of the amounts of right and left side letters which needs to be explored further . The top panel of Figure 5 shows the surfaces described by the regression results , for the ranges of values of R and L present in the data . All cases present a hyperbolic paraboloid shape , with slightly changing slopes in the ranges of R and L . A visual inspection shows how the nonlinear term bRL does not change our conclusions : The slope on the R axis is always positive and only becomes moderated in the case of Yelp , but it does not turn negative in the range of possible values . Similarly for L , the slope is always negative and it only softens along the R axis , but it does not turn into a positive slope . Thus , we conclude that , even in the presence of colinearities and nonlinear effects , the QWERTY effect is present when encoding text to express evaluative meaning .
The results shown in Table 4 are robust to permutation and bootstrapping tests . The lower panel of Figure 5 shows the density functions of the estimates of bR and bL after permuting the data and in bootstrap samples . Permuted estimates for the first three datasets are centered around 0 and do not reach the mean of bootstrap estimates for three of the datasets , and the their distribution of estimates in the bootstrap samples is significantly far from 0 .
5 . DISCUSSION
In our studies , we find robust evidence for the QWERTY effect both at the point of text interpretation ( decoding ) as well as at the point of text creation ( encoding ) . We explicitly avoided selecting on the dependent variable by including a wide range of datasets in which the effect could be tested . This way , we analyzed 15 datasets ( 11 in the decoding study and 4 in the encoding study ) from 11 different online me dia to obtain cross platform insights . We found robust evidence for the existence of the QWERTY effect when reading texts ( decoding ) in 8 datasets , and we learned that the effect might be reversed under particular conditions . Furthermore , we found significant evidence during writing texts ( encoding ) in three datasets , showing that positive reviews tend to contain more right side letters and negative reviews more left side letters.4
Limitations .
Despite the general pattern of a positive right side coefficient , two cases showed non significant positive effects : Epinions and BookCrossing . One explanation for this could be a lack of statistical power in our strict methods , or the limited size of these two datasets . For the case of BookCrossing , the effect could also be absent due to books existing before widespread keyboard use . Another interesting exception appears in one of the adult video communities , which was subject to possible sampling biases in the listing of the sitemap . That dataset showed a strong cutoff on video dates and might have had unpopular videos removed . If this were true , the negative effect would be consistent with the interaction that we found in Amazon for sales rank : The QWERTY effect weakens or even reverses when popularity or marketing forces are in play . In any case , we must note that we lack a testable conjecture that explains how the QWERTY effect might interact with popularity and under which conditions . The existence of the QWERTY effect in the datasets we have studied however does not imply that it has to exist in every possible context , and its absence in a community that discusses a particular type of content does not constitute a rejection of the effect in general . Future work might investigate the effect in additional web datasets on other types of products or entities , such as beer [ 8 ] or wine [ 31 ] , which were not available to us during the course of our study .
We complemented previous experimental studies with observational tests , and thus our contribution suffers the typical limitations of observational , non obtrusive studies . First , we did not have any degree of control on the conditions of our tests and we could not study if the same content would

Regression estimates and significance levels for the right side coefficient ˆb in Ordinary Least Squares ( OLS ) , robust regression ( MM ) , and residualized estimates using controls . Significance levels of one tailed bootstrap , permutation , and Spearman tests with alternative hypothesis b > 0 , with maximum significance level of p < 0.05 in 10000 samples . With the exception of Epinions , BookCrossing , and Redtube , there is robust evidence that support the existence of a QWERTY effect .
Figure 4 : Stratified analysis of the QWERTY effect in Youtube videos ( A ) and Amazon products ( B ) controlling for linguistic measures ( top ) and contextual properties ( bottom ) . Each dot shows an estimate of the right side coefficient ˆb for each decile divided by the control variable . The right side coefficient ˆb is stable across all variables in Youtube . The right side coefficient in Amazon decreases for products with infrequent words and long names , and disappears for products with very high sales . be evaluated differently depending on its name . Natural experiments are a promising avenue to combine experimental and observational methods , but we ultimately need experiments in which , all things being equal , show a dependence between evaluation and right side letter measurements . Second , besides our illustration of the RSR on books , we did not reach timespans long enough to test the emergence of the QWERTY effect in a longitudinal manner . This point is specially challenging , as we are dealing with a property of language that cannot be simply reset in a group of individuals . Third , our observational methods only test the effect in an aggregated manner , leaving open the question of individual idiographic differences depending on demographic conditions like age or gender , on factors of human computer interaction like handedness or other layouts , and on psychological factors like personality or locus of control .
Our work focused on English speaking online media and filtered out non English content . We must highlight that this contains the assumption that the QWERTY keyboard layout is widely used in those communities , which might not be the case when non native English speakers communicate online . Further research might also consider other languages and keyboard layouts , but this might not be straightforward , as languages coexist in some online media . It is also important to note that the normative nature of language can cancel out minority effects like left handed users or other language keyboards , in line with the findings that the effect can also appear in experiments with left handed users and other layouts [ 6 ] . While we include a wide variety of linguistic and contextual controls , we did not account for more complex effects such as alphabetic ordering effects or finger alternations [ 25 ] . In addition , language is more than just letters , and nonlinear hierarchical interactions should be tested at the level of words and phrases .
While our work tests the existence of the QWERTY effect , we do not evaluate its predictive power . Our regression approach allows us to quantify the strength of the coupling between evaluative content and the amounts of right and left side letters in item names and review texts . As suggested by the subconscious aspect of the effect , the strength of the

Right Side Ratio was very small , in the line of other influential results in psycholinguistics that reveal variations of term frequencies below 1 % [ 20 , 27 ] . A small change in emotional language can also have large implications , for example driving social factors of emotions beyond critical thresholds that produce macroscopic phenomena [ 36 , 2 ] .
Dactilar onomatopoeias .
The QWERTY effect is a special case of onomatopoeia , a symbol class that violates the general arbitrarity of the relationship between signs and meanings [ 11 ] . This kind of relationships are not new and are well documented in linguistics , in general with respect of how words phonetically imitate the sounds or objects they signify . For example , low voice tones are used to refer to large objects ( eg ” huge ” ) and high pitches to small objects ( eg ” tiny ” ) , resembling how large cavities produce lower sounds ( eg contrabass vs violin ) . Since the organs used to articulate words online are our fingers , we can talk about dactilar onomatopoeias that connect hands and fingers with meanings . Pronouncing words with the vocal tract does not have any precise spatial orientation , but using a keyboard to communicate introduces the asymmetry of the keyboard layout in the communication process .
6 . CONCLUSIONS
To the best of our knowledge , this study provides first evidence of the extent of the QWERTY effect on the web . In our datasets we confirm that products with more right side letters and fewer left side letters have higher average ratings , as suggested by [ 25 ] . As an application to marketing , our results support the concept that the ” right ” name might provide certain yet limited advantages . Furthermore , we show that this extends to movie titles and Youtube videos , where the presence of the effect in the ratio of likes was particularly robust . Our exploration of confounds and interactions showed how the effect diminished for Amazon products with infrequent words and very high sales . We also found an interesting exception of an inverse effect that calls for further research to understand how contextual properties can influence hand to meaning associations . Finally , we tested the effect during encoding through the text of product reviews and their star ratings , finding first evidence that positive meanings are written with more right side letters .
Our work has implications for wider research in psychology and computational social science . The existence of the effect is an example of a combination of collective social factors and embodied emotions within the hyperlens model of emotions [ 26 ] . Our results can also be understood as an example of lateralization , not only in the metaphoric sense but also as a psychological phenomenon . With respect to online interaction , the QWERTY effect is one example of social components in the expression of sentiment , in line with assortativity of happiness [ 3 ] and emotion dependent cascading behavior [ 2 ] .
The right and left side letter quantities that we measured are promising with respect to tasks that involve semantic annotation or sentiment analysis . Future sentiment analysis tools might explore whether adding the Right Side Ratio as a variable improves prediction quality . In addition , it will be interesting to explore whether and how the QWERTY effect might interact with popularity and spreading processes , testing if messages with more right side letters are shared more frequently or trigger longer discussions .
