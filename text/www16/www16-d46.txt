Abstract
We study the question of setting and testing reserve prices in single item auctions when the bidders are not identical . At a high level , there are two generalizations of the standard second price auction : in the lazy version we first determine the winner , and then apply reserve prices ; in the eager version we first discard the bidders not meeting their reserves , and then determine the winner among the rest . We show that the two versions have dramatically different properties : lazy reserves are easy to optimize , and A/B test in production , whereas eager reserves always lead to higher welfare , but their optimization is NP complete , and naive A/B testing will lead to incorrect conclusions . Despite their different characteristics , we show that the overall revenue for the two scenarios is always within a factor of 2 of each other , even in the presence of correlated bids . Moreover , we prove that the eager auction dominates the lazy auction on revenue whenever the bidders are independent or symmetric . We complement our theoretical results with simulations on real world data that show that even suboptimally set eager reserve prices are preferred from a revenue standpoint .

Introduction
A key part of auctions is setting the minimum price at which the seller is willing to part with the item . The so called reservation , or , reserve , price is critical to maximizing revenue , as proven by Myerson in his Nobel prize winning work [ Mye81 ] . In the online advertising scenario , setting the reserve price is a non trivial exercise—the auctions are repeated , hence agents may be adapting their behavior to influence the learning [ ARS13 , MM14 , CGM15 ] , only a glimpse into the buyers’ valuations is known [ DRY15 ] , and there is a heterogeneity in the sophistication level of the bidders . On the other hand , as observed by Celis et al . [ CLMN14 ] , many of the auctions have very few bidders ( the median number of bidders is six in their dataset ) , thereby exacerbating the need for good reserve prices to maximize revenue .
The fact that reserve prices are a good idea comes from Myerson ’s seminal work [ Mye81 ] which shows that if the valuations are drawn independently and identically ( iid ) from a distribution satisfying a certain regularity assumption , then the optimal auction takes the form of a second price auction with a reserve price . Myerson ’s result generalizes past the
1 iid setting : if agents are independent but not identical , the optimal auction involves sorting the agents by a function of their bid ( called the virtual value ) and assigning the item to the agent with largest non negative virtual value .
In practice , the optimal auction is complicated to implement , since it involves learning the distributions of valuations in a robust enough manner to allow the computation of virtual values . And even if this computation were feasible , in the spirit of Wilson doctrine [ Wil85 ] , simple detail free mechanisms are often preferred in complex environments in order to mitigate the risks introduced by assumptions of the model . In the spirit of designing simpler auctions for the non iid setting , Hartline and Roughgarden [ HR09 ] show that if players are independent and their distribution obey the monotone hazard rate condition , then there exist a vector of personalized reserve prices that generates revenue which is at least half of the optimal revenue . Both assumptions ( independence and monotone hazard rate ) are necessary for their result .
In this work , we revisit the topic of setting personalized reserve prices in second price auctions from the perspective of a practitioner : How to compute them ? How to make sure they are computed correctly ? How to apply them in an efficient manner ? While asking this question , we avoid ( in most of our results ) making any assumptions about the shape of the bid distributions .
Evaluation . In practice computing a reserve price that behaves well in offline simulations is only the first part of the process . A successful experimental evaluation is key in proving that assumptions made in theory are reasonable , and do not lead to unintended consequences . Testing reserve prices is a separate research challenge in and of itself . We distinguish between short term studies , where the goal is to measure the immediate benefit of the reserve prices , and long term studies that intend to capture the strategic interactions between the bidders and auctioneer . Here we focus on the short term studies , and observe that testing personalized reserve prices , even in this , relatively simple , setting , is non trivial , and can lead to incorrect conclusions .
1.1 Our Contributions
We show that the problem of computing and applying personalized reserve prices is nuanced , and has paradoxical behavior , particularly when testing the efficacy of reserves in an A/B test . Our empirical evaluations show that the paradoxical behavior is not limited to theory , but does occur in practice as well .
We begin by describing two different approaches to applying personalized reserve prices : lazy and eager , and show that while sometimes one approach dominates another on revenue , they are always within a factor of two of each other ( Theorem 3 ) .
We then identify two mildly restrictive settings ( those of symmetric bidders , and independent bidders ) and show that in these situations optimal eager reserve prices always yield more revenue ( Theorems 6 and 7 ) .
Turning to computational issues in setting the optimal lazy and eager reserve prices , we show that a simple nearly linear time algorithm can compute the optimal lazy reserves from
2 previous history , while computing the optimal eager reserves is NP hard ( Propositions 10 and 11 ) .
We show that naive A/B testing of eager reserve prices always leads to a drop in revenue , even when the reserve prices are set correctly! ( Theorem 13 ) We observe that lazy reserves do not suffer from this problem , and behave in an intuitive manner .
Finally , we present an empirical evaluation of our findings on real world data , and show that the performance of the algorithms is much better than the large approximation factors guaranteed by the theory ( Section 7 ) .
2 Preliminaries We consider the standard setting of single item auctions . Let A = {1 , 2 , . . . , n} be the set of agents interested in the item . Each agent i has a value vi for the item , and submits a bid bi to the auctioneer . Given a vector of bids b = ( b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ) , we denote by b(1 ) the highest bid , and b(2 ) the second highest bid . We will denote by r = ( r1 , r2 , . . . , rn ) the vector of personalized reserve prices .
We assume that the valuation of each agent is drawn independently from an unknown distribution with CDF F and PDF f . To ease the exposition we assume that the distributions F are regular , in that the virtual value function φ(v ) = v− 1−F ( v ) is monotone non decreasing . In the case when all of the distributions are identical and known to the seller , F1 = F2 = f ( v )
. . . = Fn , Myerson proved the following characterization of the optimal auction :
1 . Collect bids b1 , b2 , . . . , bn . 2 . Discard all bids that are below φ−1(0 ) . 3 . Allocate the item to the agent with the highest bid , and charge her the maximum of
φ−1(0 ) and b(2 ) .
Note that φ−1(0 ) acts as a reserve price for the auction : this is the minimum bid any agent must submit to win , and also acts as a lower bound on the revenue to the seller .
In this work our focus is on the non identical setting . In this case Myerson proved that the optimal auction is :
1 . Collect bids b1 , b2 , . . . , bn . 2 . For each agent , discard bid bi if it is lower than φ−1 3 . Allocate the item to the agent with the highest virtual value , φi(bi ) , and charge her i ( φj(bj) ) , where j is the agent with the second highest i ( 0 ) and φ−1 the maximum of φ−1 virtual value . i ( 0 ) .
There are two major differences from the identical setting . First , instead of having a universal reserve price φ−1(0 ) , each agent now has a personalized reserve price φ−1 i ( 0 ) . Second , the winner is determined as the agent whose bid has the highest virtual value , not the one who has the highest bid .
3
While the first auction is easily implemented in practice , the latter is much more problematic . First , the virtual value functions depend critically on the value distributions , which themselves are not always known and must be estimated . Second , the auction is counterintuitive to outsiders , as the agent with the highest bid does not always win the item .
2.1 Personalized Reserve Prices
To combat the potential bid inversion that comes with ordering by virtual values , Hartline and Roughgarden [ HR09 ] proposed keeping the personalized reserve prices aspect of the optimal auction , but ordering items by bid instead . They show that with monopoly reserves φ−1 i ( 0 ) , this auction yields a 2 approximation to the revenue of the optimal auction when agents are independent and follow the monotone hazard rate condition .
This natural approach leads to two possible flavors of second price auctions , which were first introduced by Dhangwatnotai et al . [ DRY15 ] . Informally , in the eager regime , we first discard all of the bids that do not meet their personalized reserve prices and then run the second price auction on the remaining bids . In the lazy regime , we always try to allocate the item to the agent with highest bid . If her bid is below the reserve price the good goes unallocated , otherwise the agent is charged the maximum between her reserve price and the second highest bid . We describe these two auctions more formally in Section 3 .
2.2 Estimating Value Distributions
Myerson ’s theoretical analysis requires us to know the cumulative density function F , as well as the PDF , f , to compute the virtual value function φ(· ) . In practice this is a tall order . In the online advertising context , the auctions are repeated , and thus we can observe a number of draws from the distribution . For example , we observe the sequence of bids for agent i : i , b2 b1 i , b3 In this work we focus on the computational complexity of computing optimal personalized reserve prices from the previous bids . In particular we show that the optimization question for eager and lazy auctions has very different profiles , one being solvable in polynomial time , and the other being NP complete . i , . . . , from which we can compute empirical estimates ˆF and ˆf for F and f .
3 Lazy and Eager Auctions
Insisting that advertisers are ranked by bid leads to two flavors of second price auctions . As before , let b = ( b1 , b2 , . . . , bn ) be the bids submitted to the auctioneer , and assume without loss of generality that b1 ≥ b2 ≥ b3 . . . bn . Let r = ( r1 , r2 , . . . , rn ) be the vector of reserve prices , with reserve price ri applying to bidder i .
Following the work of Dhangwatnotai , Roughgarden and Yan [ DRY15 ] , we define second price auctions with lazy and eager reserves .
Lazy Reserves : • If b1 < r1 then there is no winner and the item goes unsold .
4
• if b1 ≥ r1 , allocate the item to bidder 1 and charge her max(r1 , b2 ) . Eager Reserves : • Let S = {i : bi ≥ ri} be the set of bidders who bid above reserve . • Let j be bidder with the highest bid in S ( ties broken by the original ordering ) . • Allocate the item to bidder j and charge her the maximum of her reserve and second highest bid in S : max(rj , maxi∈S−{j} bi ) .
Observe that when the reserve prices are identical , r1 = r2 = . . . = rn , then both of these approaches implement the standard second price auction . We denote by RevL(b ; r ) and RevE(b ; r ) the revenue obtained by running the lazy and eager auctions on the same set of bids and reserve prices . Both versions of the auction are incentive compatible and individually rational , since , i ≥ bi . Moreover , in either whenever player i wins with bid bi , she still wins with all bids b case , the payment of i correspond to her critical bid , ie , the infimum of the bids for which he wins .
3.1 Example
To demonstrate the difference between the two approaches and show why in general the revenues are incomparable , consider the following two examples .
Example 1 ( Eager Dominates Lazy ) . Consider an auction with three bidders A , B , and C , who bid 7 , 5 , and 3 respectively . Suppose the vector of reserve prices is 8 , 1 and 2 . The auction with lazy reserves tries to allocate the item to A since she has the highest bid . However , since her bid is lower than her reserve price , the item goes unallocated , and the seller collects no revenue . The auction with eager reserves first filters out A , allocates the item to B and collects revenue of 3 .
Example 2 ( Lazy Dominates Eager ) . As above let A , B , and C be the three bidders bidding 7 , 5 , and 3 . Suppose the vector of reserve prices is 2 , 6 and 1 . The auction with lazy reserves allocates the item to A since her bid is above her reserve and charges her 5 ( the second highest bid ) . On the other hand , the auction with eager reserves first removes B from consideration ( since his bid is below reserve ) . A still wins the item , but is charged only 3 .
Intuitively , eager reserve prices lead to higher revenue when the highest bid is priced out ; whereas lazy reserve prices lead to higher revenue when the second highest bidder is priced out .
4 Comparing Lazy and Eager Reserve Prices
The second price auctions with eager and lazy reserves are identical when all agents are subject to the same reserve price . If the reserve prices are personalized , however , the outcomes
5 of the auctions can be very different . In terms of welfare , it is easy to see that the auction with eager reserves always dominates the auction with lazy reserves . The auction with lazy reserves allocates the item only if the highest bidder is above her reserve price . In such cases , the auction with eager reserves also allocates the item . This fact alone makes a second price auction with eager reserves more attractive to sellers that care about match rate .
As we saw in examples in Section 3 , in general the revenue gains due to lazy and eager reserve prices are incomparable . In this section we provide a tighter characterization , and identify broad classes where one mechanism dominates another .
We begin with Theorem 3 and prove that for any ( possibly correlated ) bid distribution no auction generates more than twice the revenue of the other , and give two examples to show this bound is asymptotically tight .
Then , in Section 4.2 we show that the revenue of the optimal eager mechanism dominates that of the optimal lazy mechanism whenever either ( i ) the bidders are symmetric ( the joint bid distribution doesn’t change when bidders are permuted ) , or , ( ii ) the bidders’ bids are drawn from independent ( not necessarily identical ) distributions . Theorem 3 . Let D be any distribution over bid vectors b . Also , let RevL(b ; r ) and RevE(b ; r ) denote the revenue of the lazy and eager auctions under bid vectors b and personalized reserves r . Let : r∗ L = arg max r∗ E = arg max r r
Eb∼D[RevL(b , r) ] ,
Eb∼D[RevL(b , r) ] .
Then
Eb∼D[RevL(b , r∗ Eb∼D[RevE(b , r∗
L ) ] ≤ 2 · Eb∼D[RevE(b , r∗ E ) ] ≤ 2 · Eb∼D[RevL(b , r∗
E) ] , L) ] .
Proof . For the first inequality , consider running the eager second price auction with r∗ L . For any bid vector b , if the highest player is below the reserve then : RevL(b , r ) = 0 ≤ RevE(b , r ) . If the highest player is above the reserve and her payment in the lazy auction is her reserve , then both auctions generate the same revenue . The final case is the case where the highest bidder is above the reserve and the payment in the lazy auction is the second highest bid . In this case , the revenue of the eager auction might be lower if the second highest bidder is below her reserve . For that bid vector , however , the revenue of the lazy auction is the second highest bid , which is equal to the revenue of the auction with no reserve prices . Therefore :
RevL(b , r∗
L ) ≤ max[RevE(b , r∗
L ) , RevE(b , 0 ) ]
≤ RevE(b , r∗
L ) + RevE(b , 0 )
Taking expectations over b we obtain the first inequality :
E[RevL(b , r∗
L ) ] ≤ E[RevE(b , r∗
L ) + RevE(b , 0 ) ]
≤ 2 · E[RevE(b , r∗ E ) ]
6
For the second inequality , consider running a lazy second price auction with r∗
E . If for any bid vector b , the highest player is above her reserve , the lazy auction is guaranteed to generate more revenue than the eager auction . If not , then the eager auction generates at most revenue equal to the bid of the second highest bidder ( since revenue is dominated by welfare ) , which is the revenue of the second price auction with no reserves . Therefore :
RevE(b , r∗
E ) ≤ max[RevL(b , r∗
E ) , RevL(b , 0 ) ]
≤ RevL(b , r∗
E ) + RevL(b , 0 )
We obtain the second inequality by again taking expectations over b :
E[RevE(b , r∗
E ) ] ≤ E[RevL(b , r∗
E ) + RevL(b , 0 ) ]
≤ 2 · E[RevL(b , r∗ L ) ]
4.1 Lower Bound Examples
The following examples complement the bounds in Theorem 3 . First , we show an example where revenue from the eager mechanism is almost twice the revenue from the best lazy mechanism .
Example 4 . There is an instance with n bidders with valuations drawn independently from the same distribution , where the best eager mechanism generates 2− o(1 ) times more revenue than the best lazy mechanism .
Proof . Consider n identical bidders , with each bidder choosing to bid bi = n with probability 1/n2 and with probability 1 − 1/n2 bidding bi = 1 . ( Each bid is drawn independently . To break ties , each bid is perturbed by adding a noise term drawn independently from [ 0 , ] for infinitesimally small ) ) . With probability 1 − 1/n + O(n−2 ) , all bidder valuations will be 1 , and with probability 1/n− O(n−2 ) , some bidder will have a valuation of n . Thus , the optimal welfare given these valuations is 2 − O(n−2 ) .
We claim that a lazy pricing mechanism extracts at most 1 revenue . By symmetry each buyer is equally likely to be the winner . Now consider the reserve price for an individual bidder i .
• If ri < 1 + , revenue will be bounded by 1 + unless both bidder i and another bid bid high ( probability of O(n−2) ) , in which case revenue is bounded by n . The expected revenue is then 1 + o(1 ) .
• If ri > 1+ , revenue is only earned if bi = n , and is bounded by n . Since the probability of a high bid is less than n−1 , the expected revenue is bounded by 1 .
7
On the other hand , we claim that an eager mechanism can earn 2 − o(1 ) revenue . This can be done by imposing a high reserve price ri = n for i = 2 , . . . , n ( all buyers except one ) and a low reserve price r1 = 1 on the remaining bidder . With this setup :
• With probability 1/n−o(n−2 ) , one of bidders 2 , . . . , n will submit a high bid , generating revenue n − O(1 ) .
• With the remaining probability , the auction is guaranteed to clear because b1 ≥ r1 = 1 and will generate at least 1 in revenue .
The overall expected revenue is thus 1 n · ( n − o(1 ) ) + ( 1 − 1 n ) · 1 = 2 − o(1 ) .
Next , we show an example where the lazy mechanism generates twice the revenue of the best eager mechanism . This example requires both that bidders are not symmetric , and that their bids are correlated .
Example 5 . There is an instance with two correlated heterogenous bidders where a lazy mechanism generates 2 − o(1 ) times higher revenue than the best eager mechanism .
Proof . Let M be a sufficiently large constant , and consider the following joint distribution of bids of two bidders .
M , bidder 1 bids 0 while bidder 2 bids b2 = M .
• With probability log M • With probability 1− log M distribution F ( b ) = 1 − 1 set to b2 = ( 1 − )b1 for some arbitrarily small .
M , first bidder ’s bid b1 is drawn from a truncated equal revenue b for b ∈ [ 1 , M ) and F ( M ) = 1 and the second bidder ’s bid is
Lazy reserve prices r1 = 0 , r2 = M extract the full surplus as → 0 , achieving expected revenue of

Suppose the eager mechanism imposes reserves of r1 and r2 . With probability log M/M the revenue is r2 . For the remaining case , we condition on whether the second bidder bid above reserve . In the case b2 < r2 , bidder 1 is competing against his reserve price , r1 , generating revenue of at most : r1(1 − F ( r1 ) ) ≥ r1
1 −
1 − 1 r1
= 1 .

If , on the other hand , when b2 ≥ r2 , the total revenue is bounded by : bf ( b)db = log M − log r2 = log(M/r2 )
Putting these together the overall revenue is at most :
M r2
+ log M
M r2 ≤ 1 + r2

M r2
1 − log M M
1 + log log M
M
+ log M − log r2
This function is convex in r2 , thus achieving its maximum at the endpoints of the interval . It obtains its maximum value of ( 1 + o(1 ) ) log M at r2 = 1 .
4.2 Restricted Settings
Above we proved that while the revenue from lazy and eager auctions is always within a factor of two of each other , an unconditional bound is impossible in general . Here we consider two restricted settings , first of symmetric bidders , and then of independent bidders . In both cases we show that eager auctions dominate lazy auctions .
Symmetric Bidders . We say that bidders are symmetric ( sometimes also called exchangeable ) if the bid distribution is invariant under permutations . Formally , for every permutation π : [ n ] → [ n ] let bπ be the vector ( bπ(1 ) , bπ(2 ) , . . . , bπ(n) ) . A distribution is symmetric if the distribution of bπ is the same as the distribution of b . Notice that iid implies symmetry , but symmetry is more general—for example , consider the bid distribution obtained by choosing in each time one buyer at random and letting her bid H and letting every other buyer bid L . The distribution is clearly symmetric , but it is not independent ( since there is always exactly one buyer bidding H ) .
Theorem 6 . If bidders are symmetric the optimal eager mechanism yields at least as much revenue as the optimal lazy mechanism .
Proof . Proposition 10 tells us that the optimal lazy reserve price for bidder i is a function of the joint distribution of winning bids and prices conditioned on bidder i winning . If bidders are symmetric , the optimal lazy reserve prices are the same for all bidders ; r1 = r2 = ··· = rn . If all reserve prices are the same , lazy and eager mechanisms behave identically . ( It is however possible that a different reserve price vector yields higher revenue for the eager mechanism , as in Example 4 . )
Independent Bidders . We show that if each bidder draws her value independently , auctions with eager reserves are always at least as good auctions with lazy reserves .
Theorem 7 . If bidder valuations are drawn independently ( not necessarily from identical distributions ) , the optimal eager mechanism yields at least as much revenue as the optimal lazy mechanism .
9
To prove the theorem we will exhibit a method that , given any vector r of lazy reserve prices , produces a vector rE such that E[RevE(b ; rE ) ] ≥ E[RevL(b ; r) ] . The construction will rely heavily on the independence of the bids . A key concept in the proof is that of trimmed distributions :
Definition 8 ( trim ) . Consider a non negative random variable X distributed according to some distribution D , and a real number r ≥ 0 . We use trim(D ) to denote the distribution of the random variable X = X · 1{X ≥ r} , ie random variable that is equal to X if X ≥ R and is zero if X < r .
In the following proofs , we will
This definition allows us to define the main lemma . abbreviate Eb∼D[Rev(b , r ) ] by Rev(D , r ) . Lemma 9 . Given independent bid distributions Di , D = D1 × . . .Dn and a reserve price vector r , there exists a vector of reserve prices r such that : RevL(D , r ) ≤ RevL(D , r ) i = trim(Di ; r i ) . where D = D
1 × . . . × D n and D
First we show how to use Lemma 9 to prove Theorem 7 : of Theorem 7 . Let r and D be as in Lemma 9 . Notice that for b ∼ D , Pr[0 < bi < ri ] = 0 . Since a bidder is never blocked by the reserve , the revenue in both the eager and lazy auctions is the maximum of the second highest bid and the reserve of the highest bidder . This implies that RevE(D , r ) = RevL(D , r ) . Since D stochastically dominates D , there is a distribution on pairs of vectors ( b , b ) such that the marginals are D and D and b i ≤ bi for all i for every realization of the random variables . Hence , RevE(b ; r ) ] ≤ RevE(b ; r ) . Taking expectations we conclude that
RevE(D , r ) ≤ RevE(D , r ) .
Putting this together with the inequality from Lemma 9 :
RevL(D , r ) ≤ RevL(D , r ) = RevE(D , r ) ≤ RevE(D , r )
Now , all is left to do is to prove Lemma 9 : of Lemma 9 . Assume that the bidders are sorted such that r1 ≥ r2 ≥ . . . ≥ rn . We will define an algorithmic procedure that iterates through bidders 1 to n and at each iteration i , trims the distribution of the i th bidder and possibly increases the reserves of agents j > i . It is useful to think of r and D = D1 × . . . × Dn as variables that are updated in the course of the procedure . The procedure will keep the following invariants : ( i ) RevL(D , r ) cannot decrease ; ( ii ) for all bidders already processed , their distribution is trimmed at their reserve , ie , Pr[0 < bi < ri ] = 0 . ( iii ) the reserve prices will continue to be sorted .
10
Now , we are ready to describe each iteration . When we process bidder i , we perform the following procedure :
Choose x < ri such that :
ED[RevL(b ; r)|bi = x ] ≥ ED[RevL(b ; r)|bi < ri ]
Set Di = trim(Di , ri ) and rj = max(rj , x ) for j > i . j
Revj
L(b ; r ) ] = ED[Revi
L(b , r ) where Revj
First notice that ED[Revi is the revenue obtained from bidder j . is also maintained . It is convenient to write RevL(b , r ) =
Clearly we maintain invariants ( ii ) and ( iii ) . Now , we only need to argue that invariant ( i ) L(b , r ) L(b ; r ) ] since the lazy auction just extracts revenue from i when she is the highest bidder and above her reserve ( and those events are unaffected by trimming ) . Also , in the lazy auction , the reserves on bidders other than the highest bidder do not affect the outcome . L(b ; r)|bi ≥ ri ] . Conditioned on bi > ri the only thing changing in the two scenarios is that the reserve price of j is now r j = max(rj , x ) ; since x < ri , it cannot be binding as bidder i is bidding ( Notice that for bidders j < i , their reserve price was already at least ri , so bi > ri . r j = rj = max(rj , x ) since x < ri < rj . ) L(b ; r)|bi = x ] , since in the first case i must be bidding zero and j is subject to reserve rj = max(rj , x ) , but this reserve can be implemented by having i bid x .
For all other j = i , notice that ED[Revj
L(b ; r)|bi ≥ ri ] = ED[Revj
L(b ; r)|bi < ri ] = ED[Revj
Finally , ED[Revj
Combining all of the expressions , we get :

L(b , r)|bi ≥ ri ] Pr(bi ≥ ri ) L(b , r)|bi = x ] Pr(bi < ri )
Plugging this into the last expression , we get that :
ED[RevL(b , r ) ] ≥ ED[RevL(b , r ) ]
5 Computing Optimal Reserves
In this section we investigate the computational complexity of computing the optimum reserve prices in the eager and lazy settings . We assume that the input to the problem is given as a set of bids submitted to previous auctions . Since the number of auctions run daily is extremely large , it is important for this procedure to be linear , or nearly linear in the size of the input .
We prove that from a computational perspective , lazy and eager auctions are vastly L can be done in linear time . On different . Computing the optimal vector of lazy reserves r∗ the other hand , computing the optimal vector of eager reserves r∗ Proposition 10 . The optimal vector of lazy reserves r∗ time in the size of input logs . Proof . Given bids {bi,t} , for each query t , let wt correspond to the agent that would win if no reserve prices were set . For any given vector of reserves r , either wt wins query t or no agent wins . Let Qi be the queries for which wt = i . Then we can write the revenue for the vector r of reserves as :
L can be computed in nearly linear
E is NP hard .
RevL(b ; r ) =
1{b(1 ) t ≥ ri} · max(ri , b(2 ) t ) t∈Qi i running time O( t b(2 ) t where b(1 ) are respectively the highest and second highest bid for query t . The previous expression shows that for lazy reserves , the problem of computing reserve prices can be decoupled for every i . Also , the optimal reserve price should be of the form b(2 ) for t some t . If not , we can increase it to the next point and the revenue can only increase . or b(1 ) t in constant time .
This observation gives an algorithm for computing the optimal vector of reserves with i |Qi|2 ) . In order to turn it into a nearly linear time algorithm , notice that if we sort the bids appropriately , we can compute the revenue for setting each ri = b(1 ) and t ri = b(2 ) t for t ∈ Qi and annotate each entry of weather it is a highest bid or a second highest bid . If ni = |Qi| , this is an array of 2ni numbers . Sort the array by bids in increasing order , which takes O(ni log ni ) , and call its elements r1 ≤ r2 ≤ . . . r2ni . Assume for simplicity that all elements are distinct . t ≥
Given a certain rj , we can write the revenue associated with it R(rj ) =
In order to do so , construct an array with all the bids b(1 ) t and b(2 )
1{b(1 ) t t ) as rj · kj + sj where sj = rj} · max(rj , b(2 ) t∈Qi t∈Qi b(2 ) t t } . · 1{rj ≤ b(2 )
If we show how to compute ( sj+1 , kj+1 ) from ( sj , kj ) in constant time , we have a nearly linear time algorithm . Doing it is easy . This can be done in two cases :
12
• rj = b(1 ) for some t . Therefore increasing the reserve past b(1 ) unallocated . All other queries are unaffected . Set kj+1 = kj − 1 and sj+1 = sj . t will make query t to be t
• rj = b(2 ) t for some t . Therefore increasing the reserve past b(2 ) t will cause the reserve price to bind for query t , instead of the second highest bid . Update : kj+1 = kj + 1 , sj+1 = sj − rj . vector of reserves in time O(
Since we can reconstruct the revenue for each value in the array , we can choose the optimal i |Qi| · log |Qi| ) . It is not hard to see that this algorithm still works if values of the array are repeated .
Proposition 11 . Computing the optimal vector of eager reserves r given the bids from a set of previous auctions is NP hard .
Proof . We give a reduction to the independent set problem . Let L and H be constants that we will chose later . Given a graph G = ( V , E ) , we map the independent set problem on this graph to the following instance of the reserve price problem with eager reserves : consider |V | agents and |E| + |V | queries . For each edge e = ( u , v ) consider queries where bu = L , bv = L and all other agents bid zero . And for each node u , consider queries with bu = H and all other agents bid zero . We select L and H such that L < H < 2L . Clearly , for the optimal vector of reserves , ri ∈ {L , H} . Also , notice that in the optimal solution , the set of nodes I = {u ∈ V ; ru = H} must form an independent set . Indeed , if there is an edge e = ( u , v ) with ru = rv = H , then there is zero revenue from the queries corresponding to edges e . If we switch either u or v to have reserve L , then we gain L revenue from edge e and lose H − L from node u . Since L > H − L , this is a profitable deviation .
The revenue associated with setting u ∈ I to H and other nodes to L is given by
L · ( |E| + |V | ) + ( H − L ) · |I|
So the optimal vector of reserve prices would give a solution to the maximum independent set problem .
Combining the proof of Theorem 3 and Proposition 10 we get a 2 approximation to the optimal revenue obtained by running an eager second price auction .
T We remark that the algorithm proposed in Proposition 10 is different from the heuristic proposed by Hartline and Roughgarden in [ HR09 ] : their heuristic consists in choosing the t=1 r · 1{bi,t ≥ r} . They vector of monopoly reserve prices rM such that rM observe that while this is a very good choice when the valuations are independent and follow the monotone hazard rate condition , this can be arbitrarily far from the revenue of the optimal auction if either condition is violated . We complement the observation showing that this vector can also be arbitrarily far from the optimal revenue of the second price auction with personalized reserves ( which is a weaker benchmark than the optimal auction ) . Claim 12 . For every constant C , there is a distribution of bids such that Rev(b ; rM ) ≤ Rev(b ; r∗ ) for both the eager and lazy auctions . i = arg maxr≥0

Proof . Consider 2 bidders and consider a distribution on bids that sets b1 = b2 = 2k−1 with 2k probability , for k = 1 , . . . , K − 1 , and b1 = b2 = 2K−1 + with probability 2 probability 1 2K . u = 2K−1 + generating revenue 1 + · 21−K . The optimal The monopoly reserve prices are rM vector of reserves is zero for both eager and lazy reserves : Rev(b ; 0 ) = K + · 21−K .
6 A/B Testing
In the previous sections we described auctions with eager and lazy reserve prices , and compared the differences in welfare , revenue , and computational complexity of the two approaches . The theoretical models are clean and elegant , and allow us to abstractly reason about the benefits of one approach over another ; however they do not capture the messy realities of setting reserve prices in practice .
Before releasing a new model into the wild , a key step is measuring the impact of its change on a small sample of traffic . This too is a non trivial step , and requires a lot of care both in setting up the experiments [ KHS07 ] and effectively measuring long term , as well as , short term impacts [ HOT15 ] ,
One way to test reserve prices is to partition all of the auctions into treatment and control , and then only apply reserves in treatment scenarios . However , such a test gives a biased estimate of the revenue lift—since the effect on an individual buyer is small ( as the test applies only to a small fraction of the auctions ) , the buyer is unlikely to react strategically , for example changing her bidding behavior , or looking for alternative places to buy the impressions .
A different approach is to partition the bidders into treatment and control groups , and only apply reserve prices to the bidders in treatment . It is easy to see that applying reserve prices to only a fraction of the bidders will reduce the overall revenue gains , however since a single buyer is now subject to reserve prices on all of her auctions , she is more likely to update her behavior in response .
It is natural to expect that applying a vector of optimal reserves to a subset of the buyers would yield an improvement in revenue that would allow us to evaluate the impact of applying reserves to all of the buyers . Counterintuitively , we show that even in the simplest
14 possible setting ( iid buyers with regular distributions ) , applying the Myerson reserve price to a subset of the bidders is worse than not applying any reserve prices at all! In other words , as we add bidders to the treatment group , the total revenue decreases , and it is only when all of the bidders are treated that we realize the revenue gains . As we show in Section 7 , this phenomenon is not a purely theoretical construct , but is also not uncommon in practice .
We state the results formally .
Theorem 13 . Assume agents are iid with regular distribution F and let RevE(k ) be the revenue obtained from applying the Myerson reserve price eagerly to k out of n agents and applying no reserve to the remaining agents . Then :
RevE(0 ) ≥ RevE(1 ) ≥ RevE(2 ) ≥ . . . ≥ RevE(n − 1 )
Proof . Since agents are iid we can sample agents according to the following procedure : draw n iid samples from F and take a random assignment from them to agents . This is equivalent to drawing the valuation vi for each agent and then choosing k out of n at random players to apply reserve prices . We will denote by v(t ) the t th largest bid .
We consider two scenarios : ( i ) the highest bidder is above the reserve . In this case , she will be allocated the good . ( ii ) the highest bidder is below the reserve . In this case , the agent to whom we allocate the good is the highest agent for whom no reserve price is applied . ements drawn from {z1 , z2 , . . . , zn} . Notice that for any vector z , the function MaxRt(z1 , z2 , . . . , zn ) is monotone non decreasing in t . Second , observe that if zi are drawn iid , then :
Let MaxRt(z1 , z2 , . . . , zn ) be the expected maximum of a uniformly random subset of t el
E[max{z1 , . . . , zt} ] = MaxRt(z1 , z2 , . . . , zn ) .
For k < n , by the Myerson Lemma :
RevE(k ) = E[φ(v(1 ) ) · 1{v(1 ) ≥ r}]+
E[MaxRn−k(φ(v1 ) , . . . , φ(vn))|v(1 ) < r ] · Pr(v(1 ) < r )
( (cid:63 ) )
We finish by noticing that when vi < r then φ(vi ) < 0 . Therefore the second term above is negative and non increasing in k by the monotonicity of the MaxR operator . For k = n , however , the second term disappears and we recover the optimal auction .
We now show that the auction with lazy reserve prices does not suffer from this kind of paradoxical behavior .
Theorem 14 . Assume agents are iid with regular distribution F and let RevL(k ) be the revenue obtained from lazily applying the Myerson reserve price to k out of n agents and applying no reserve to the remaining agents . Then
RevL(n ) +,1 − k
RevL(0 )
RevL(k ) = k n n
15
Proof . As in the previous theorem , we sample the agents by drawing n iid samples from F and taking a random assignment from them to agents .
In the second price auction with lazy reserves , we will choose the agent with bid v(1 ) and declare her as the winner if v(1 ) is at least the reserve price , which is r with probability k/n and 0 with the remaining probability . By Myerson ’s lemma :
RevL(k ) = E[φ(v(1 ) ) · 1{v(1 ) ≥ r(1)} ] where r(t ) denotes the personalized reserve of agent with the t th highest bid . Therefore :
RevL(k )
=,1 − k =,1 − k n n
E[φ(v(1) ) ] +,1 − k RevL(0 ) +,1 − k
E[φ(v(1 ) ) · 1{v(1 ) ≥ r} ] RevL(n ) n n
To better understand the detrimental effect of eager reserve prices , it ’s useful to write equation ( (cid:63 ) ) in explicit form so that we can evaluate the impact of applying reserves to a subset of buyers for particular distributions :

Pr(v(1 ) ≤ x ) = Pr(vi ≤ x ) = F ( x)n . For the second term , since the agents are iid , the
Proof . For the first term , notice that the distribution of v(1 ) is given by nF ( x)n−1f ( x ) since maximum of n−k randomly chosen agents from among n buyers is identical to the maximum of n − k buyers . By the principle of deferred decisions , we can first sample n − k buyers and then draw their values . Since in the second expression we condition their value to be at most r , we can simply compute the maximum over n − k buyers with density f ( x)/F ( r ) for 0 ≤ x ≤ r . By the same argument as before the density of the maximum is ( n − k ) · f ( x ) . Using n−k−1

6.1 Case study : Uniform distribution

7 Experimental Results
In the previous sections we discussed versions of the second price auction with personalized reserve prices : the eager ( E ) and lazy ( L ) auction , and proved that while the two notions of reserve prices are incomparable , eager reserves dominate lazy reserve , except for non identical and non independent settings , and in all of the settings total revenue of one is always within a factor of two of another . Further , we showed that applying the eager reserve prices to a subset of the bidders is non monotonic , and applying reserves to more bidders may ( in theory ) lead to lower revenues . In this section we validate these findings by simulating the effect of reserve prices on real world data .
Data . We collect bids sent to a large advertising exchange over the course of part of a day , and then restrict our attention to five ad slots with the highest traffic volume . Each of the ad slots has the bids submitted for hundreds of thousands of auctions . We report the results for each of the ad slots individually .

7.1 Non monotonicity
Recall that in Section 6 we considered the standard setting where each bidder i draws an independent bid from bid distribution Fi . In the case of eager reserve prices , applying reserves to only a subset of the bidders leads to a decrease in the overall revenue to the auctioneer . In this section we show that this scenario is not restricted to theory . We consider a set of auctions and compute the optimal lazy reserve price for each bidder . We then apply this reserve price in both lazy and eager fashions to a subset of the bidders and plot the overall revenue . The results are shown in Figure 7 .
We confirm our theoretical findings : while the revenue in the auction with the lazy reserve pricing strategy is monotonically increasing in the number of bidders subject to the reserve , the same cannot be said for the greedy reserve pricing strategy . The overall trend is positive , but it is non monotonic , and at times increasing the number of bidders subject to the optimal reserve price decreases the overall revenue .
7.2 Revenue Gains
Our second set of experiments addresses the question whether eager or lazy reserve prices lead to higher revenues in practice . For the best comparison , we simulate the auctions under both lazy and eager strategies while applying the optimal lazy reserve prices r∗ L ( see Proposition 10 ) and the monopoly reserve prices rM ( see the discussion following the proof of Proposition 11 ) .
We compute the revenue lifts due to personalized reserves under four strategies :
∆L(r∗
L ) = E[RevL(b ; r∗
L ) ] − E[Rev(b ; 0 ) ]

We normalize the lifts by setting the revenue of the lazy reserve auction with optimally L ) = 1 ) , and report multiplicative improvement over this setting . Table 1 shows that the eager auction outperforms the lazy auction in practice both when the optimal lazy reserves are used and when monopoly reserves are used . We also observe that there is no clear winner between using optimal lazy reserves or monopoly reserves in the eager auction . For 3 out of 5 slots , the vector of optimal lazy reserves outperforms the monopoly reserves . In practice one may want to start with any of those two vectors and perform local updates to improve the performance of the eager auction .
Another axis along which it makes sense to compare the eager and lazy auctions is the welfare loss of the allocation , ie , how much welfare is lost due to the application of reserve prices . If WL(b ; r ) and WE(b ; r ) are respectively the welfare of the lazy and eager auctions when reserve price r are applied , we define the quantities :
L ) = E[W(b ; 0 ) ] − E[WL(b ; r∗ ˜∆L(r∗ L ) ] L ) = E[W(b ; 0 ) ] − E[WE(b ; r∗ ˜∆E(r∗ L ) ] ˜∆L(rM ) = E[W(b ; 0 ) ] − E[WL(b ; rM ) ] ˜∆E(rM ) = E[W(b ; 0 ) ] − E[WE(b ; rM ) ] which are the analogues for social welfare of the quantities described in Table 1 .
As expected , Table 2 shows that the welfare loss in the eager auction is larger than the welfare loss in the lazy auction . Similarly to what occurs for revenue , there is no clear winner between the optimal lazy reserves and the monopoly reserves for the eager auction .
8 Conclusion
The results in this work follow two major themes . The first lies in devising methods for testing new strategies , be they reserve prices , bidding agents , or mechanisms , in competitive

The second is in foregoing the assumption that bidders’ value distributions are known and investigating the computational complexity of optimizing from previously observed data . Whether designing new mechanisms in these environments [ CR14 ] , understanding the amount of past data needed [ MR15 ] , or , providing approximation algorithms , as we do in this work , this is a rich and exciting open area .
