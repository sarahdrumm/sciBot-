ABSTRACT Centrality measures allow to measure the relative importance of a node or an edge in a graph wrt other nodes or edges . Several measures of centrality have been developed in the literature to capture different aspects of the informal concept of importance , and algorithms for these different measures have been proposed . In this tutorial , we survey the different definitions of centrality measures and the algorithms to compute them . We start from the most common measures , such as closeness centrality and betweenness centrality , and move to more complex ones such as spanningedge centrality . In our presentation , we begin from exact algorithms and then progress to approximation algorithms , including sampling based ones , and to highly scalable MapReduce algorithms for huge graphs , both for exact computation and for keeping the measures up to date on dynamic graphs where edges are inserted or removed over time . Our goal is to show how advanced algorithmic techniques and scalable systems can be used to obtain efficient algorithms for an important graph mining task , and to encourage research in the area by highlighting open problems and possible directions .

INTRODUCTION
Identifying the “ important ” nodes or edges in a graph is a fundamental task in network analysis , with many applications , from economics and biology to security and sociology . Several measures , known as centrality indices , have been proposed over the years , formalizing the concept of importance in different ways [ 16 ] . Centrality measures rely on graph properties to quantify importance . For example , betweenness centrality , one of the most commonly used centrality indices , counts the fraction of shortest paths going through a node , while the closeness centrality of a node ∗Main contact .

Other centrality measures use eigenvectors , random walks , degrees , or more complex properties . For instance , the PageRank index of a node is a centrality measure , and centrality measures for sets of nodes have also been defined . With the proliferation of huge networks with millions of nodes and billions of edges , the importance of having scalable algorithms for computing centrality indices has become more and more evident , and a number of contributions have been recently proposed , ranging from heuristics that perform extremely well in practice to approximation algorithms offering strong probabilistic guarantees , to scalable algorithms for the MapReduce platform . Moreover , the dynamic nature of many networks , ie , the addition and removal of nodes or edges over time , dictates the need to keep the computed values of centrality up to date as the graph changes . These challenging problems have enjoyed enormous interest from the research community , with many relevant contributions proposed recently to tackle them .
Our tutorial presents , in a unified framework , some of the many measures of centrality , and discusses the algorithms to compute them , both in an exact and in an approximate way , both in memory and in a distributed fashion in MapReduce . The goal of this unified presentation is to ease the comparison between different measures of centrality , the different quality guarantees offered by approximation algorithms , and the different trade offs and scalability behaviors characterizing distributed algorithms . We believe this unity of presentation is beneficial both for newcomers and for experienced researchers in the field , who will be exposes to the material from a coherent point of view .
The graph analyst can now choose among a huge number of centrality indices , from the well established ones originally developed in sociology , to the ones more recently introduced ones that capture other aspects of importance . At the same time , the original algorithms that could handle the relatively small networks for classic social science experiments have been superseded by important algorithmic contributions that exploit modern computational frameworks or obtain fast , high quality approximations . It is our belief that the long history of centrality measures and the ever increasing interest from computer scientists in analyzing larger and richer graphs create the need for an all around organization of both old and new materials , and the desire to satisfy this need inspired us to develop this tutorial .
2 . OUTLINE
The tutorial is structured in three main technical parts , plus a concluding part where we discuss future research directions . All three technical parts will contains both theory and experimental results .
Part I : Definitions and Exact Algorithms .
In this first part , we introduce the different centrality measures , starting from important axioms that a good centrality measure should require . We then discuss the relationship between the different measures , including results highlighting the high correlation between many of them . After having laid these foundations , we move to present the algorithms for the exact computation of centrality measures , both in static and in dynamic graph . We discuss the state of the art by presenting both algorithms with the best worst case time complexity and heuristics that work extremely well in practice by exploiting different properties of real world graphs . Exact computation of centrality measures becomes impractical on web scale networks . Commonly , one of two alternative approaches is taken to speed up the computation : focus on obtaining an approximation of the measure of interest or use parallel and distributed algorithms . In the second part of our tutorial we explore the former approach , while in the third part we deal with the latter .
Part II : Approximation Algorithms .
Most approximation algorithms for centrality measures use various forms of sampling and more or less sophisticated analysis to derive a sample size sufficient to achieve the desired level of approximation with the desired level of confidence . In this part we present a number of these sampling based algorithms , from simple ones using the Hoeffding inequality to more complex ones using VC dimension and Rademacher Averages . For each algorithm , we discuss its merits and drawbacks , and highlight the challenges for the algorithm designer . We also discuss the case of maintaining an approximation up to date in a dynamic graphs , presenting a number of contributions that recently appeared in the literature .
Part III : Highly scalable Algorithms .
In the third part of our tutorial , we discuss parallel and distributed algorithms for the computation of centrality measures in static and dynamic graphs . Specifically we present an approach based on GPUs and one based on processing parallel/distributed data streams , together with experimental results .

INTENDED AUDIENCE
The tutorial is aimed at researchers interested in the theory and the applications of algorithms for graph mining and social network analysis .
