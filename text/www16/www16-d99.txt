ABSTRACT We quantify the extent to which references to papers in scholarly literature use persistent HTTP URIs that leverage the Digital Object Identifier infrastructure . We find a significant number of references that do not , speculate why authors would use brittle URIs when persistent ones are available , and propose an approach to alleviate the problem .

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION
Motivated by a desire to achieve persistence when linking to web resources , various solutions have been introduced aimed at decoupling the identification and location of a web resource by means of HTTP URIs ; a comprehensive overview is available from [ 1 ] . Solutions such as PURL , W3ID , identifiers.org , and DOI make use of a resolver infrastructure to achieve this goal . They use an identifying HTTP URI to persistently identify a web resource , and a locating HTTP URI for the resource ’s current web location . The custodian of a web resource maintains the correspondence between the identifying URI and the locating URI in the resolver ’s look up table as the resource ’s location changes over time . When a client accesses the identifying URI , it is redirected to the locating URI .
This solution is attractive , especially when it is to be expected that the domain where a resource is located may change over time . This is , for example , the case with academic journals that move hands between publishers as acquisitions and mergers take place . The solution comes at a price because it requires operating a resolver infrastructure and maintaining the look up table that powers it . But , as long as the identifying URI is used to link to a resource , the solution achieves its goal of link persistence .
In 2014 , we conducted a large scale study about reference rot1 in web based scholarly communication [ 2 ] . The focus of our study was on links to so called web at large resources found in scholarly articles , that is , links to resources that are themselves not scholarly papers . Our intuition suggested that , in order to filter out links to scholarly articles , we only would have to remove links targeted at the DOI resolver , ie with baseURL dxdoiorg After all , academic publishers started assigning DOIs to papers about two decades ago , and the practice has been the norm across disciplines for many years . However , when eyeballing the result of this DOI based filtering , we were stunned to be left with many links with baseURLs that were clearly associated with academic publishers , for example biomedcentral.com , sciencedirect.com , and linkspringercom To put it differently , we found a significant number of references to papers linked by their locating URI instead of their identifying URI . For these links , the persistence intended by the DOI persistent identifier infrastructure was not achieved . In this poster , we determine how widespread this problem is , we speculate on the origin of the problem , and propose a possible way to address it .
2 . METHODOLOGY
For the aforementioned reference rot study , we collected more than 1.8 million papers published between 1997 and 2012 , in three scholarly corpora : the entire arXiv.org preprint collection , a sizable sample of papers in Elsevier journals , and all papers submitted to PubMed Central . We extracted almost 4 million URI references using advanced regular expression techniques [ 3 ] from all sections of those papers including footnotes , tables , and references . We dismissed 1.7 million URI references because they were to license statements such as creativecommons.org/licenses/ or to miscellaneous resources such as 127001 and wwwexampleorg The data is available via [ 2 ] .
For this poster , we take the remaining , approximate 2.2 million , URI references as a starting point , and use them to determine how commonly scholarly papers are referenced by means of their locating URIs instead of their persistent , DOI based , identifying URIs . We observe that Elsevier papers hardly contain any DOI references , an artefact of the formatting of papers obtained via the CrossRef Text and Data Mining API2 ; DOI references are added on the fly by Elsevier ’s dissemination platform . This observation leads us

• DOI : Scholarly paper referenced by means of an identifying DOI based URI Selecting these references is trivial as they all have dxdoiorg as their baseURL . • shouldBeDOI : Scholarly paper referenced by means of a locating URI In order to select these references , we use a list of hash values of publisher baseURLs provided by CrossRef3 . If the hash of a baseURL of an extracted reference matches a hash in CrossRef ’s list , a reference is added to this category .
• web at large : Web resource referenced – references that do not fall into the DOI nor the shouldBeDOI category .
3 . RESULTS
Following the aforementioned methodology , we end up with 397 , 412 DOI , 505 , 647 shouldBeDOI , and 737 , 847 webat large references . We depict the distribution of these references in function of the publication date of the referencing paper in Figure 1 for arXiv and Figure 2 for PubMed Central . DOI references are blue , shouldBeDOI red , and webat large green . The publication date on the x axis ranges from 2005 to 2012 .
In both figures , each category grows over time , consistent with the continuous growth of paper publications per year and the increased use of HTTP URI references [ 2 ] . In the arXiv corpus , shouldBeDOI grows slowly and steadily whereas DOI makes a sudden jump around 2009 , possibly related to the provision of DOIs in downloadable references for Physics , Mathematics , and Statistics , which constitute the majority of this corpus . From 2009 onwards , DOI outnumbers shouldBeDOI but a significant number of shouldBeDOI references remain , for example , about 20 , 000 in 2012 . The pattern in PubMed Central is quite different . Growth for all categories kicks off in 2008 , consistent with NIH submission mandates4 . But , for all publication years , shouldBeDOI outnumbers DOI , and web at large tops both . An astonishing number of papers are referenced by means of their location

URI instead of their DOI based identifying URI , for example , about 80 , 000 in 2012 .
These results must be interpreted subject to two caveats . First , the list of hash values of publisher baseURLs is an approximation as it represents the current state of location URIs in the CrossRef resolver . As a result , some shouldbeDOI references may have been categorized as web at large because a location URI used years ago is no longer in use today . Second , lacking public information as to when publishers started assigning DOIs to papers , some references may have wrongly been categorized as shouldbeDOI because a publisher did not yet use DOIs prior to a certain publication date . However , given the widespread adoption of DOIs by scholarly publishers in recent years , we feel confident that our analysis is reliable for the depicted timeframe .
4 . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We quantified the widespread use of location URIs instead of DOI based identifying URIs for referencing papers in scholarly literature . We do not know why authors choose brittle links over persistent ones . But , being authors ourselves , we speculate that it has to do with the use of the location URI when bookmarking and creating entries in citation management tools . After all , the paper and associated information is available at the location URI , not the identifying URI . In order to alleviate this problem , we propose the use of a Link5 header field in the HTTP response of the location URI that conveys a link pointing with an appropriate relation type canonical comes to mind to the identifying URI . Bookmarks and citation managers could use this Link information to record the identifying URI and make links that were intended to be persistent actually persistent .
