ABSTRACT
In this paper , we propose a simple framework to characterize the switching behavior between search engines based on click streams . We segment users into a number of categories based on their search engine usage during two adjacent time periods and construct the transition probability matrix across these usage categories . The principal eigenvector of the transposed transition probability matrix represents the limiting probabilities , which are proportions of users in each usage category at steady state . We experiment with this framework using click streams focusing on two search engines : one with a large market share and the other with a small market share . The results offer interesting insights into search engine switching . The limiting probabilities provide empirical evidence that small engines can still retain its fair share of users over time .

1 . INTRODUCTION Web search has become a very competitive field in recent years . With virtually zero switching cost and large revenue , web search engines are trying hard to expand their market share . Our research aims to characterize the web search competition with a set of metrics on user share , user engagement and user preference . We focus on interaction metrics : the main statement is about the probability of users switching from one engine to another over a specific time period . From there , we also paint a picture of the ultimate market share of search engines when the web search competition reaches equilibrium . Although the web search competition is highly non stationary , these numbers offer a distilled view of the current competitive landscape and can be used as an objective to optimize .
We assume that quality of web search results affects people ’s choice of search engines . We identify the queries searched on

ACM 1 59593 051 5/05/0005 . both engines by the segment users who switch from one engine to the other as potentially problematic queries . The initial results have shown that these queries are indeed more problematic than queries searched on both engines by all the users .
2 . Framework We partition click streams into user sequences . First , click streams are divided into individual sessions , each session being assigned a representative timestamp . Each session will then be characterized according to its usage across search engines and be assigned a label . After labeling , we specify two adjacent time periods t and t+1 . We then construct two sequences of labeled sessions ( St , St+1 ) for each user according to the session timestamps where St represents the sequence during time period t ; St+1 represents the sequence during time period t+1 . These user sequences ( St , St+1 ) are the input to our framework .
We estimate the transition probabilities Pij from usage class i to usage class j from time period t to time period t+1 . To define the usage classes , we segment the users by apply clustering procedure to the user sequences on both t and t+1 and find K clusters . The resulting clusters are interpretable and the clusters representing loyalists for that frequently switch between search engines inter and intra search sessions are identified . individual search engines and switchers
Each user will be assigned two cluster memberships Ct = f(St ) and Ct+1 = f(St+1 ) where f is the model generated from the clustering procedure with Ct and Ct+1 ∈ {1 , 2,… , K} . We construct the frequency table of the number of users who transition from class i to class j from t to t+1 . Let Fij denote the number of users who transition from class i to j from t to t+1 . Let P denote the transition probability matrix and each element Pij denote the conditional probability that a user will be in class j during time period t+1 given that she is in class i during time period t . That is ,
P ij ≡
Pr( j at t
+
| 1 i at t
)
Pij can be estimated as follows
^ P
≡ ij
F ij K =∑ 1 j
F ij
P describes the search engine switching behavior , or trend , of the underlying population from time period t to time period t+1 . From P , we can make inferences about how loyal the users are with respect to individual search engines . We can also infer if a particular engine is losing users to another search engine .
We can also forecast the transition probabilities from time t to t+s as Ps . When s approaches infinity and assuming P is aperiodic , Ps
1050 will converge to P* with all the rows equal to the vector of limiting probabilities . Let ΠT = ( π1 , π2 , πK ) denote the vector of limiting probabilities where ∑i πi = 1 . Π is the principal eigenvector of PT since PTΠ = Π with eigenvalue 1 . The limiting probabilities are the ultimate user share at steady state assuming current trends hold .
3 . Preliminary Results The raw data used here is the complete click streams from an ISP . 12 weeks of data is used . The click stream is in the following format :
( USER ID , TIMESTAMP , URL VISITED )
The data is sessionized and the sessions with nonzero usage of either A or B are kept . Each search session is given a label as follows :
A : if only engine A is searched in this session
B : if only engine B is searched in this session
C : if both engine A and B are searched in this session
We select out the users who have at least 5 search sessions in the first six weeks and at least 5 search sessions in the second six weeks for our analysis .
We use the percentage of sessions on A , B and C as the clustering features . The clustering results of K means are shown in Table 1 . Note that the 5th to 7th columns are the centers of the clusters representing the mean percentage of sessions on A , B and C . The last column is our interpretation of each cluster by comparing the cluster centers and examining the members in each cluster . The cluster IDs are sorted by “ %B ” .

Table 1 : Cluster Memberships
The 10 clusters are further grouped into 3 main categories : primeA ( cluster 1 and 2 ) , prime B ( cluster 5 10 ) and switchers ( cluster 3 , 4 ) to make the interpretation easier and construct the transition probability matrix as shown in Table 2 . From Table 2 , we can clearly see that non switchers tend to stay in the same group between the two time periods and engine B has a much more cohesive user base than engine A . The switchers are more likely to switch to other groups and become either prime A or prime B users . User engagement and user preference can be inferred from the transition probability matrix and will be discussed in section 4 .

Table 2 : Transition Probability Matrix
Table 3 summarizes the mean number of sessions consumed during the 12 week period by each cluster of users . An interesting fact is that the off diagonal cells suggest that people who transition from one group to another consume less sessions . It suggests if a search engine can make users search more , the chance of losing users to another search engine will be lower .

4 . Key Metrics User Share . We define user share of A during time t as the share of prime A users during time t . From Table 1 , the user share of A is 3.22 % ( cluster 1,2 ) during the 1st 6 week period whereas the user share of B(cluster 5 10 ) is 9533 %
User Engagement . We define user engagement of A as the probability that users remain in prime A during the second period . From Table 2 , the engagement of A is 78.67 % whereas the engagement of B is 9893 %
User Preference . We define user preference of B to A as the odds ratio of switchers to prime B over switchers to prime A . We construe preferences as a choice made after an evaluation process . We consider that the switchers in the first period as users who are in the process of evaluation . From Table 2 , the preference of B to A is 3.73 , which means switchers are over three times more likely to prefer B to A .
Trends . We define trend of A as the current share of prime A users and the share of prime A users at steady state . From Table 1 , the trend for A is 68 %
5 . Conclusions We present a simple framework to characterize the switching behavior between search engines based on click streams . Our findings indicate that such simple framework can generate insightful competitive metrics . The metrics about user preference and user engagement can be derived from the transition probability matrix . The user share describes the current market share and the limiting probabilities offer a distilled view of the current trend . We also infer that engines with small market share can retain its fair share since the limiting probability is non zero and some users actually prefer small engines to big engines . Finally , user engagement , user preferences , market share and number of search sessions consumed are all positively correlated with one another . It provides empirical evidence that to increase market share , search engines should work to improve user engagement and preference scores .
