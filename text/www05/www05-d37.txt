ABSTRACT We propose a function oriented classification of web images and show new applications using this categorization . We defined nine categories of images taking into account of their functions used in web pages , and classified web images by using Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) in tree structured way . In order to achieve high accuracy of classification , we employed two kinds of features , image based features and text based features , and the two kinds can be used together or separately for the stages of the classification . We also utilized DCT coefficients to classify photo images and illustrations . As a result , accurate classification has been achieved . Finally , we show the page summarization as a new application that is made feasible for the first time by our new categories of WWW images .

1 . INTRODUCTION The number of images utilized in web pages has been increasing drastically . The images on web pages do not only convey the content of the images themselves but also provide important visual structure of the web pages . In most of the web services , however , images are discarded and only text data are analyzed . Although image features were employed in some researches to improve image search accuracy [ 1 ] , main parts of their algorithms were still based on text data analysis . On the other hand , we have proposed web image classification [ 2 , 3 ] based on the function of the images using SVM and demonstrated some new applications such as summarization of web pages and categorization of web pages . In our previous work , the discrimination accuracy of photos and illustrations was guide poor . Therefore , the purpose of this paper is to enhance the accuracy of the classification by introducing frequency analysis using discrete

2 . CATEGORIZATION OF WEB IMAGES 2.1 Categories Based on the Functions We have defined nine function based categories by analyzing a number of web sites . Namely , main titles , section titles , photos , illustrations , icons , list of pages , logos , advertisements , and segmented Images . Examples of some categories are shown in Figure 1 . It has been verified that the images in other web sites can be classified to the categories 2.2 Classification Algorithm For the classification , we employ SVM [ 5 ] and we introduced two kinds of features of the images : image based features and textbased features . Image features consist of image size , the number of pixels , aspect ratio , the number of colors , color histograms of Cr and Cb , and file type . On the other hand , location of the image in the page , length of comments added to the image , existence of a link , existence of the same image in the same page , and so on , were used as text based features . Web images are classified according to the classification tree shown in Figure 2 . One of the two features or both were selected at each stage of the classification tree to achieve better performance by empirical study . However , in our previous work , it has been revealed that photos and illustrations cannot be separated well by these two features . Therefore , we introduced DCT coefficients as new features . We divided the images into 8x8 blocks and calculated the mean of the absolute DCT coefficients . Then , average DCT coefficients matrices for photos and illustrations were obtained and regularized . The differences of the regularized coefficients are illustrated in Figure 3 . ( a ) . The darker the brightness is , the larger the difference is . For efficient computation , we selected the most significant 20 coefficient indices as shown in Figure 3 . ( b ) . 2.3 Experimental Results of Classification 2,500 images randomly selected from 130 company web sites were utilized as a training data set . Then , 1,500 images that were not contained in the training set were evaluated . We classified the images into the nine categories as listed section 2.1 using the SVM with an RBF kernel . The experimental results are shown in Table 1 . In order to evaluate the total performance of the classification , the F measure is also introduced . The F measure is calculated by the following equation :

950 In our previous work [ 2 ] , the average of F measure of all categories was 0339 By employing two kinds of features , new parameters , and regularization of the parameters of features , the average of F measure came to 0712 Particularly , the DCT contributed very well to discriminating between photos and illustrations . By utilizing the DCT , the F measure of photos , and illustrations went up from 0.684 and 0.358 to 0.889 and 0450 3 . SUMMARIZATION OF WEB PAGES New applications have been made possible by using the image classification results based on their roles and functions . In this paper , the web summarization is shown as an example . A section title image is a symbol image of a section and shows the section content . Therefore , web pages can be summarized by using section title images . Figure 4 shows experimental results . When a page has section title images , showing only them and texts around these images will produce a summarization of the page . The most important point here is that our approach is language independent , because it is based on images .
4 . CONCLUSION In this paper , we proposed web image classification based on the roles and functions of the images . By employing both image based features and text based features , pretty accurate performance have been achieved . In addition , we introduced DCT as new features . As a result , much better performance in classification of photo images and illustrations has been achieved as compared to our previous work . Based on the classification results , we have demonstrated language independent summarization of web pages .
