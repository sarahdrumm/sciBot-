ABSTRACT We introduce a new visualization framework for the intercomparison of more than one data set retrieved from Web services . In our framework , we use more than one visualization space simultaneously , each of which visualizes a single data set retrieved from the Web service . For this purpose , we provide a new 3D component for accessing Web services , and provide a 3D space component , in which data set retrieved from the Web service is visualized . Moreover , our framework provides users with various operations applicable to these space components , ie , union , intersection , setdifference , cross product , selection , projection , and joins . Categories and Subject Descriptors : H52 [ User Interfaces ] : Graphical User Interfaces ( GUI ) , Interaction Styles General Terms : Design , Human Factors Keywords : Visualization , Web service , IntelligentBox , WorldBottle

INTRODUCTION
Recently , we can obtain lots of information through various Web services , especially , in the fields of product information and bioinformatics . Web services are software components invoked remotely through an XML interface . In this paper , we define Web services as the enabling technologies satisfying the following three requirements : ( 1 ) Web services are software components made available as services over the Internet . ( 2 ) The interface of these software components are described using the WSDL . ( 3 ) Web services use the SOAP protocol for exchanging messages .
The motivation for this work arises from the following consideration . First , users may need to compare the visualization of more than one data set , which requires their simultaneous visualization instead of their sequential visualization . Second , programmers can use various Web services to access data resources , and they can combine Web services with each other . However , it is difficult for endusers to interactively use and/or combine Web services through graphical user interface .
Such consideration has led us to introduce a new framework . Our framework has the following three functions ; ( 1 ) one for using Web services in a 3D environment , ( 2 ) one for visualizing more than one data set retrieved from Web services in more than one visualization space , and ( 3 ) one for

2 . ACCESS TO WEB SERVICES
We introduce a 3D proxy component for accessing Web services . This component works as a proxy of Web services . We also introduce 3D component mechanisms for creating requests to Web services . Figure 1 shows our architecture for accessing Web services . ( 1)(2 ) For a desired Web service , the user first inputs the URL of its WSDL into the WebServiceProxyBox(WSPBox ) , and selects an operation from the function list in the WSDL . ( 3 ) The WSPBox creates QueryBoxes automatically to create a request to the selected operation . The selected operation may require various parameters that are constructed by various types , ie , string , integer , and a compound type “ struct ” . Each parameter is treated as a slot . If the parameter has a compound type , the QueryBox has a child QueryBox to create a compound type value ( eg para3 in Fig 1 ) . ( 4 ) User adds boxes as user interfaces in order to input values to QueryBoxes ( eg StringBox for para1 ) . User inputs values into the added boxes to create a request . ( 5)(6 ) The WSPBox retrieves information about the created request from the selected Web service . ( 7 ) WSPBox extracts the data set portion from the data retrieved from the Web service . ( 8 ) The extracted data set is visualized by our framework for the virtual reification of database records[2 ] . By introducing user defined visualization components , any types of data sets can be visualized in arbitrary manners .

The WorldBottle displays a relevant information space in its inside , and works as a portal to this visualization space . We introduce mechanisms for combining WSPBoxes and WorldBottles . Data sets created by WSPBoxes are sent to the spaces displayed in WorldBottles through their #I/O Port slots . To connect one Web service to another , we provide a special component called MappingBox . The MappingBox gets a value of an attribute in one record , and sets this value to a parameter of the selected operation .
Consider the following example of Fig 2 and Fig 3 . First , the user inputs a keyword , and obtains a PDB ( Protein Data Bank ) id list from SRS service . The result id list is visualized in space B by sending the data through the #I/O Port of WorldBottle . Next , the user can get 3D structure data of the protein retrieved from GetEntry service for each pdb id . The pdb id in one record in space B is set to the parameter of GetEntry service through a MappingBox . Data sets retrieved from GetEntry service are visualized in space C , D , and E . The user can simultaneously observe more than one protein 3D structure related to the same keyword . Figure 3 shows that the user can easily change representations , among “ Spacefill ” , “ Ball and Stick ” and “ Wire Frame ” , using other WorldBottles . keyword pdb id list

To compare different data sets visualized in different World
Bottles , we provide mechanisms for simultaneously manipulating scenes displayed in more than one WorldBottle , such operations include panning , rotating , zooming , and mechanisms for manipulating objects visualized in each WorldBottle , ie , rotating , translating , scaling . Each manipulation is applied to more than one WorldBottle in parallel . In Figure 3 , the user is simultaneously manipulating scenes and data sets in the WorldBottles C , D , and E , which are children spaces of the space B .
4 . OPERATIONS
Now , we introduce operations applied to each WorldBottle . Operations applied to a WorldBottle are applied to the data sets in this WorldBottle . Using this framework , the user can compare data sets and recognize the differences between data sets . We use database relational operation as operators , ie , union , intersection , set difference , crossproduct , selection , projection , and joins . To use relational operation as operators , each space is treated as a database view . Every operation to spaces is treated as a view modification . Figure 4 shows that the operation to select a data set with the condition “ σchainID= “ A ” ( R1 ) ” allows us to create a new view R2 . Figure 5 shows that the space R1 can be dropped into R2 to make the view R2 modified to a new view R3 which is the union of view R1 and R2 .

5 . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
Our framework provides basic mechanisms for the intercomparison of more than one data set retrieved from various Web services . Moreover , we can easily create integrated 3D visualization systems for Web services and Databases , using our framework . We are considering some improvement to our framework , ie , other types of operators applicable to representations in order to compare data set more effectively , and mechanisms for carrying out operations on a set of spaces all at once , and more effective interaction techniques for all operations .
