ABSTRACT How to effectively allocate system resource to meet the Service Level Agreement ( SLA ) of Web servers is a challenging problem . In this paper , we propose an improved scheme for autonomous timing performance control in Web servers under highly dynamic traffic loads . We devise a novel delay regulation technique called Queue Length Model Based Feedback Control utilizing server internal state information to reduce response time variance in presence of bursty traffic . Both simulation and experimental studies using synthesized workloads and real world Web traces demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach .

One major problem web hosting companies face is how to meet the Service Level Agreements ( SLAs ) with their clients without excessively over provisioning resources . SLAs are usually expressed in the form of the average response time guarantee , above which is not acceptable to the clients . It is of great theoretical and practical interests to provide delay service guarantees to clients in Web server systems . To control the average response time in Web servers , a Queueing Model Based Feedback Control architecture is proposed in [ 1 ] . However , we observe that the performance of Queueing Model Based Feedback Control deteriorates in presence of bursty Web traffic . In particular , clients may experience large variances in response time . In this paper we devise a new control approach , Queue Length Model Based Feedback Control to achieve better timing control performance . It utilizes server internal state information of queue length to better handle the transient behaviors caused by rapidly changing traffic loads . As a result , response time ’s variance is greatly reduced while its mean still

In Section 2 , we identify the problem of previous Queueing Model Based Feedback Control . In Section 3 , the new timing control approach ie , Queue Length Model Based Feedback Control is proposed . In Section 4 , we evaluate the performance of the proposed control approach through simulation and experimental studies using both synthetic and trace based workloads . Finally , we conclude the paper in Section 5 . traffic can be modeled using
2 . PROBLEMS WITH QUEUEING MODEL BASED FEEDBACK CONTROL Studies reveal that the Web traffic is bursty and exhibits selfsimilar properties [ 2 ] . It has been shown the burstiness of Web request the Pareto On/Off distribution . To evaluate the performance of different control approaches , we developed a Web server simulation package using the network simulator ns 2 . In the simulation , there are three adjustable parameters to control the “ burstiness ” of the Pareto On/Off traffic . The Burst_Time corresponds to the mean length of On period of the traffic . The Idle_Time corresponds to the mean length of the Off period and Interval is the interarrival time during On periods .

Figure 1 shows the delay experienced by a single client connection with Burst_Time=1 , Idle_Time =10 and Interval=0.1 under the original Queueing Model Based Feedback Control . The reference delay is set to Dref =2 . Each point in the upper figure is an average of response times experienced by 1000 requests . The corresponding mean and variance of the response time are 2.0041 and 1.2034 respectively . The bottom figure shows the request arrival versus the time line . We can see the traffic is indeed very busty and has interleaved On/Off periods . From Figure 1 , we observe that using the previous approach , the delay fluctuates a lot around the reference value although the long time average mean delay is close to Dref . This is because the online estimation of the request rate λ is a time average of the instantaneous request rate ( on the order of 500 requests in our implementation ) . For bursty traffic , the instantaneous request rate is larger than the long term average rate λ during On periods . However , the feed forward predictor ’s output rate is based on λ and thus is lower than the instantaneous request rate . Therefore , the request queue will build up and clients will experience longer response time . On the other hand , during periods with sporadic requests , the instantaneous request rate is smaller than λ , which leads to smaller response time . This observation motivates us to consider the use of server internal state information in the controller design to suppress large delay variations .
3 . QUEUE LENGTH MODEL BASED FEEDBACK CONTROL To reduce the response time variance under bursty traffic , we propose using server internal queue length measurements to predict service rate allocation μq . The procedure of the Queue Length Model Based Predictor is as follows : Step 1 : At each control invocation , we measure the current queue length lcurrent and update the request rate estimate λ . Step 2 : Based on results from queueing theory , a targeted queue length ltargeted is computed . For example , if M/M/1 model is used to model the server ’s internal queue , we have

K is a constant control gain , in practice , we can set K=1/Dref The proposed Queue Length Model Based Feedback Control regulator is shown in Figure 2 .

4 . EFFECT OF QUEUE LENGTH MODEL BASED FEEDBACK CONTROL We first implemented the Queue Length Model Based Feedback Control in our simulation package . To verify the design of the proposed controller , we experiment with the same Pareto On/Off traffic ( with parameters Burst_Time = 1 , Idle_Time = 10 and Interval = 0.1 ) as in Section 2 . Figure 3 demonstrates the controlled server performance using the new Queue Length Model Based Feedback Control . The variance of the client response time is 0.0051 as compared with 1.2034 using the previous Queueing Model Based Feedback Control approach . In addition , the average response time of both approaches are very close to Dref = 2 . We see using the new controller , even with this extremely bursty traffic , good delay regulation can be achieved .

We also implemented Queue Length Model Based Feedback Control on Apache web server 207 with Linux kernel 2420 We tested the new approach under both synthetic and trace based workloads [ 3 ] . Due to space limit , we have to omit the results here ; interested readers are referred to [ 3 ] .
5 . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS We proposed a new Web server timing control scheme called Queue Length Model Based Feedback Control . Compared with previous approaches , the new scheme can significantly reduce response time variance under a wide range of workload conditions including bursty traffic . This is achieved by utilizing the server internal queue length measurements . Extensive simulation study shows that the new scheme can provide smooth performance control and better track SLA specifications in Web server systems . 6 . REFERENCES [ 1 ] L . Sha , X . Liu , Y .
