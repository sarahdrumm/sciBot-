ABSTRACT We propose a set of optimization techniques , collectively called Wireless SOAP ( WSOAP ) , to compress SOAP messages The Name Space transmitted across a wireless Equivalency technique rests on the observation that exact recovery of compressed messages is not required at the receiver ; an equivalent form suffices . The WSDL Aware Encoding technique obtains further savings by utilizing knowledge of the underlying WSDL by means of an offline protocol we define . We summarize the design , implementation and performance of our Wireless SOAP prototype , and show that Wireless SOAP can reduce message sizes by 3x 12x compared to SOAP .

1 . INTRODUCTION Mobile wireless clients suffer from limited bandwidth , energy , computing and storage resources , which makes the use of XML , with its verbose and redundant nature , as well as XML based protocols , problematic [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 7 ] . Some examples of XML inefficiencies are text serialization of numbers , end tags , and namespaces . Several optimizations have been proposed that apply to XML in general , eg [ 10 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 13 ] and [ 2 ] . SOAP as a protocol built on top of XML suffers from the same issues , and adds a few on its own . For example , studies show that using SOAP uses 3x 10x more bandwidth than Java RMI [ 12 ] , [ 8 ] . Techniques for compressing SOAP messages have thus been proposed in the literature . We propose a set of optimization techniques , collectively called Wireless SOAP ( WSOAP ) , which rests on two observations . The first is that while prior techniques attempt to encode or compress SOAP messages to allow recovery in exact form , this is not required , and recovery in an equivalent form suffices ; we call this approach Name Space Equivalency ( NPE ) . The second is that if the sender and receiver are aware of the underlying WSDL , substantial additional bandwidth savings can be

We develop a simple synchronization protocol for use between the mobile device and gateway ; typically it would need to be executed only once , and offline . We call this WSDL Aware Encoding ( WAE ) . We have designed , implemented and evaluated WSOAP ; our experiments indicate that WSOAP can deliver significant bandwidth reduction compared to generic SOAP . Note that secondary benefits , such as reduced message loss and communication energy , can also accrue . We have also compared WSOAP to a generic off the shelf text compression algorithm , namely Jzlib [ 14 ] , as well as existing SOAP optimization approaches such as plain WBXML [ 13 ] and Differential Encoding [ 12 ] . WSOAP differs from these approaches as follows . Observe that generic text compression is oblivious to inherent structure in an XML document , and is typically compute intensive [ 6 ] , a drawback for mobile devices . On the other hand the Wireless Application Protocol ( WAP ) Binary XML ( WBXML ) specification standardized by W3C [ 13 ] provides binary encoding of a generic XML document designed for compact transmission with no loss of semantic information ; however WBXML is oblivious to SOAP message structure . Other XML aware compression algorithms proposed in the research literature [ 4 ] [ 10 ] typically use static , nonadaptive techniques and are guaranteed to be exact , unlike the NPE approach we take in WSOAP . The Differential Encoding [ 12 ] is oriented specifically towards technique ( DiffEnc ) compressing SOAP messages by guessing the message structure at both the source and the sink , creating a skeleton based on that , and sending only the differences between the skeleton and the actual message . DiffEnc fundamentally assumes the skeleton is the same at both the service provider and consumer ; absent a synchronization technique it can easily be fooled by differences in SOAP packaging by different SOAP processors . In addition , the use of XPATH expressions and its obliviousness to recurring elements in a SOAP message make this approach inefficient . 2 . WIRELESS SOAP ENCODING The basic principles in WSOAP are to ( 1 ) Provide static encoding based on SOAP schema ; ( 2 ) Leverage WSDL service description to create adaptive encoding for Web Service interfaces ; ( 3 ) Require functional message equivalence rather than exact reproduction ; ( 4 ) Limit computational cost by favoring codification and lookup over computation wherever possible ; and ( 5 ) Codify using a binary packaging scheme . For the purposes of discussion we assume that the mobile device connects via a wireless link to a mobile gateway , which in turn connects via a wired network to the Web Service , as shown in Figure 1 . WOAP operates over the wireless link only .

For example , within a document , defeats the purpose of XML namespaces . NPE , in contrast , exploits the fact that within any given document , the choice of a specific prefix string to denote association with a namespace is arbitrary . tags <soap:Envelope> and <s0:Envelope> are equivalent as long as the prefixes soap and s0 are associated with same namespace . WAE . If the gateway and the mobile client both have access to the WSDL for each Web Service interface used by the client application , the WSDL can be analyzed to create the requisite coding tables . We propose a protocol for synchronizing the WSDL coding tables in the gateway with the client . See Fig 2 . 3 . EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS Our experiments used the following freely available software : for Jzlib [ 14 ] ; for WBXML , we used KXML [ 9 ] ; for DiffEnc , we used diffxml [ 3 ] . All implementations were written in pure Java , running under JRE 142 with Windows XP SP1 on a Pentium ( M ) 2.79 GHz machine with 496 MB RAM . For workload , since there is no common accepted SOAP benchmark available , we chose two example messages , a cricket score service [ 1 ] and a stock quote service . See Table 1 for results . We see that WSOAP can reduce message size by 3x 12x compared to SOAP . It outperforms DiffEnc and WBXML by large factors ; in some cases DiffEnc in fact results in message size explosion . However , WSOAP only outperforms Jzlib for messages that consist largely of structured XML . For messages
