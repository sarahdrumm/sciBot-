ABSTRACT In this paper , we describe XHTML Meta Data Profiles ( XMDP ) which use XHTML to define a simple profile format which is both human and machine readable . XMDP can be used to extend XHTML by defining new relationships , meta data properties/values , and class name semantics . XMDP has already been used to extend semantic XHTML to represent social networks , document licensing , voting , and tagging . link

1 . INTRODUCTION As more people adopt XHTML+CSS for authoring documents , web logs etc , they push the limits of XHTML[1 ] . Simultaneously web developers are rediscovering the potential of the extensible “ rel ” attribute from HTML4[2 ] and are looking for ways to formalize those extensions in a manner that is readable by both humans and machines . XHTML provides numerous semantic elements for marking up documents , several extensible meta data mechanisms , and hints for how to formalize such extensions using a profile . XMDP [ 3 ] is such a profile format , built from semantic XHTML elements and designed in accordance with those hints . An XMDP profile is a dictionary of property names and values , designed for both automatic reading/processing and easy human authoring/viewing with text editors and web browsers .
2 . PROFILE FORMAT XMDP uses XHTML definition list elements <dl> , <dt> , and <dd> to define a dictionary of property names , each of which can optionally similarly define a dictionary of values . XMDP profiles can be embedded into any ( X)HTML/XML document , or published standalone as an XHTML document . For ease of

ACM 1 59593 051 5/05/0005 recognition , an XMDP profile begins with a <dl> element with a class name of “ profile ” . This example profile defines two properties , the first with two possible values , and the second with a more open ended set of values : <dl class="profile"> <dt id='property1'>property1</dt> <dd><dl> <dt id='value1'>value1</dt> <dd>definition of value1</dd> <dt id='value2'>value2</dt> <dd>definition of value2</dd> </dl></dd> <dt id='property2'>property2</dt> <dd>space of dates</dd> </dl> Each unique property and value is also has an ‘id’ attribute to enable precision referencing within a profile using a hyperlink fragment identifier , e.g http://exampleorg/profile#property1 separated set

3 . SAMPLE PROFILE FOR HTML4 The various <meta> properties used informatively in HTML4 could be normatively defined with the an XMDP document : <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC " //W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://wwww3org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1strictdtd"> <html xmlns="http://wwww3org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en" lang="en"> <head><title>sample HTML profile</title></head> <body> <dl class="profile"> <dt id='author'>author</dt> <dd>Person who wrote ( at least part of ) the document.</dd> <dt id='keywords'>keywords</dt> <dd>Comma and/or space separated list of the keywords or keyphrases of the document.</dd> <dt id='copyright'>copyright</dt> <dd>Name ( or names ) of the copyright holder(s ) for this document , and/or a complete statement of copyright.</dd> <dt id='date'>date</dt> <dd>Last updated date of the document , in ISO8601 date format.</dd> <dt id='identifier'>identifier</dt> <dd>Normative URI for the document.</dd> <dt id='rel'>rel</dt> <dd><dl> <dt id='script'>script</dt>
994 <dd>A reference to a client side script . When used with the LINK element , the script is evaluated as the document loads and may modify the contents of the document dynamically.</dd> </dl></dd> </dl> </body></html> 4 . EXTENDING CURRENT PROPERTIES XMDP can both define new meta properties , and extend current properties and attributes , such as the ‘class’ attribute , or the ‘rel’ attribute for hyperlinks . The above example demonstrates how to define a new ‘rel’ value by listing the attribute as a property in the profile , along with new values , eg ‘script’ .
5 . REFERENCING AND USING PROFILES 5.1 Referencing an XMDP profile XHTML documents all have a <head> element which has an optional ‘profile’ attribute . Documents which use properties and values from an XMDP profile should refer to that profile using that ‘profile’ attribute : <head profile= "http://example.org/profile">
5.2 Multiple XMDP profiles The ‘profile’ attribute “ specifies the location of one or more meta data profiles , separated by white space ” according to HTML4 . Thus a document which uses properties and values from multiple XMDP profiles should list those profile URLs , separated by whitespace , in the ‘profile’ attribute : <head profile="http://example.org/profile http://moreexamplecom/profile2 "> If the same property or value is defined in multiple profiles , the first of those profiles listed in the ‘profile’ attribute is used for the definition of such a property or value .
6 . CURRENT XMDP USES Here are a few examples of XMDP used to extend XHTML : •
Social networks . The XHTML Friends Network ( XFN ) [ 4 ] is a set of ‘rel’ values which enable social tagging of hyperlinks , enabling a decentralized social network to be represented using the Web . See the XFN 1.1 profile [ 5 ] written using XMDP and the recent poster on XFN[10 ] . Licenses . More and more documents on the Web are made available under one or more specific licenses . Hyperlinking to licenses using rel="license" [ 6 ] , makes them obvious to both human and machine readers .
• to
• Votes . Many search engines interpret a hyperlink to a resource as at least a mild endorsement of that resource . By the parliamentary defining ‘rel’ values analogous for/against/abstain , VoteLinks to explicitly indicate their endorsement of lack thereof . Tags . Recent web sites have enabled their users to collectively annotate or “ tag ” the uploaded content with arbitrary user selected keywords . Technorati has recently enabled[8 ] any user to “ tag ” web pages , blog posts , and other media simply by hyperlinking to the author ’s tagspace of choice with rel="tag"[9 ] .

7 . POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS There are many future possibilities for XMDP . In particular , two potential enhancements should be considered . First , modular XMDP profile documents could include one another to provide a union of properties and values . One could add hyperlinks to the XMDP format , specifically within the <dt> elements for properties . If a <dt> contained nothing but an <a href> with ‘rel’ value of “ profile ” , then the linked profile would be incorporated into the current profile as if its property definitions had been in place of that <dt> element . <dl class="profile"> <dt><a rel="profile" href="http://example.org/include">include</a > </dt> </dl> Second , it is possible ( however unlikely ) that an author may want to use properties or values with the same name but from two different XMDP profiles . XMDP could add a lightweight namespacing mechanism , e.g use the <link> element to link to the profile document with rel="profile" , and use the ‘title’ attribute to specify an attribute value Qname prefix . <link rel="profile" title="n" href="http://example.org/include" /> Where attribute values might then look like nproperty1
8 . CONCLUSIONS Thanks to its author centric ease of use , and construction from semantic XHTML , XMDP offers a valuable mechanism by which XHTML meta data can be formally extended and defined . It is our hope that tools will evolve to explore the potential .
