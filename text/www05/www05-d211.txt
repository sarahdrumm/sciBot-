ABSTRACT It has been a few years since the semantic Web was initiated by W3C , but its status has not been quantitatively measured . It is crucial to understand the status at this early stage , for researchers , developers and administrators to gain insight into what will come in this field . The objective of our work is to quantitatively measure and present the status of the semantic Web . We conduct a longitudinal study on the semantic Web pages to track trends in the use of semantic markup languages . This paper presents early results of this study with two historical data sets from October 2003 and October 2004 . Our results show that while it is very early stage of semantic Web adoption , its growth outpaces that of the entire Web for the period . Also , RDF ( Resource Description Framework ) has dominated among semantic markup languages , taking about 98 % of all semantic pages on the Web . It has been used in a variety of metadata annotation applications . This study shows that the most popular application is RSS ( RDF Site Summary ) for syndicating news and blogs , which takes more than 60 % of all semantic Web pages . It also shows that the use of OWL ( Web Ontology Language ) which was recommended by W3C in early 2004 has been increased 900 % for the period .

1 . INTRODUCTION It has been a few years since the Semantic Web was initiated by W3C [ 1 ] . It has been a collaborative effort led by W3C with participation from a large number of researchers and industrial partners . It provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application , enterprise , and community boundaries . For the past few years , we have seen significant progress in the current components of that framework , which are the RDF Core Model , the RDF Schema language and the Web Ontology language ( OWL ) . ( These languages all build on the foundation of URIs , XML , and XML namespaces . ) We also have seen significant amount of research work going on for building

Furthermore , we have seen significant amount of interest from industry for the applications of the semantic Web technology in various areas including business information and process integration , life sciences , information search , and autonomic computing . The Gartner group recently reported that Semantic Web ( with related technologies such as ontologies , metadata management , and taxonomies ) is one of the top strategic technologies for 2005 [ 2 ] . The objective of this paper is to quantitatively measure and present the status of the Semantic Web . For this purpose , the questions we aim to answer include : Who is using the semantic markup languages ? Which semantic markup languages are used , and how frequently ? What applications of semantic Web are there ? What subjects of ontology are described in the languages ? What features of the languages are used , and how frequently ? How the status is changing over time ? We understand there are alternative ways to find answers to these questions . It is important to understand the status of the semantic Web at this early stage of the initiative , for researchers , developers , and administrators to gain insight into what will come in this field , and make an informed decision on where to go with their work . In our study , we attempt to find the answers by measuring the actual use of semantic Web languages on the Web . We directly collect data on actual semantic pages on the Web , instead of depending on an indirect survey . A detail description of our analysis method and a full study report can be found in [ 4 ] .
2 . HIGH LEVEL OBSERVATIONS We conducted a longitudinal study on the semantic pages on the Web to track trends in the use of semantic markup languages . This paper presents early results on our study with two historical data sets from October 2003 and October 2004 . The input to this analysis is a set of links of all Web pages whose extension is .rdf , .daml , or .owl , indicating that the content were written in one of those semantic markup languages . The first observation is that the number of Web pages written in semantic markup languages is very small . However , the number is growing rapidly overall , and significantly in some areas . As of October 2003 , the number of semantic Web pages is 14,812 from some 7,000 servers . This number is out of over 5 billion links on some 30 million servers discovered by IBM WebFountain . The percentage of the semantic Web pages is less than 00003 % However , the growth of semantic Web pages outpaces that of the entire Web . As of October 2004 , the number of semantic Web pages becomes 46,601 , which is more than 300 % growth . At the time , there are 7.5 billion links on some 77 million servers on the Web detected by IBM WebFountain . Figure 1 graphically shows the total number of semantic Web pages for the period .

RDF are mostly metadata annotation of various resources , the counterparts of DAML and OWL are more semantically rich ontologies , which are formal description of classes in a domain , their properties , and their relationships with other classes . Figure 2 displays the RDF pages segmented by application . The RSS pages take more than 60 % of the entire semantic pages in 2004 . Its portion is actually decreased somewhat from 70 % in 2003 . However , it is still the dominating application . On the other hand , the number of pages involved in the FOAF projects grew more than 800 % to 1,503 in 2004 from 161 in 2003 . In 2004 , FOAF takes about 3 % of the entire semantic pages . The portion of other applications of RDF ( eg , library catalogs , directories , syndication of news and blogs , and personal collections of music , photos , and events ) also grew more than 300 % for the period .

3 . LANGUAGE ANALYSIS Figure 1 also shows the classification of semantic Web pages by language . It is apparent that the great majority of semantic Web pages are written in RDF . As of October 2003 , the number of semantic pages written in RDF is 14,240 out of the total 14,812 . It is about 96 % . As of October 2004 , the number changes to 45,606 out of 46,601 , which is almost 98 % . The increase of RDF pages is about 220 % for the period . Compared to RDF , the numbers of semantic Web pages written in DAML and OWL are almost negligible . However , when closely examined , they show strong dynamics for the period , especially for OWL . As of October 2003 , only 31 pages written in OWL were found in the entire Web . As of October 2004 , the number became to 310 , which is about 900 % growth over a year period . DAML pages grew from 541 to 686 for the period , which is about 27 % increase . Combined , semantic pages written in DAML and OWL increased about 74 % . It is a significant number , although it is modest when compared to that of RDF .
4 . APPLICATION ANALYSIS The RDF specifications provide a lightweight ontology system to support the exchange of knowledge on the Web . RDF integrates a variety of applications from library catalogs and directories to syndication of news and content to personal collections of music , photos and events . This study discovered that a single RDF application which dominates among others is RSS ( Really Simple Syndication or RDF Site Summary 10 ) It is a lightweight multipurpose extensible metadata description and syndication format proposed in August 2000 to the RDF Interest Group . RSS began catching on a couple of years ago , when Web logs or blogs , started using it to allow readers to know they had posted something new . Soon traditional publishers dove in . During the past year , The Wall Street Journal , National Public Radio , and Reuters Group among others have added RSS feeds [ 3 ] . RSS 1.0 uses RDF , but the current version RSS 2.0 is not based on RDF . Another popular application of RDF discovered in this study is the Friend of a Friend ( FOAF ) project , which is about creating a Web of machine readable homepages describing people , links between them and things they create and do . While applications of s e g a P f o r e b m u N
