ABSTRACT In this paper we measure correlation between link analysis characteristics for Web pages such as in and out degree , PageRank and RBS with those obtained from real Web traffic analysis . Measurements made on real data from the Polish Web show that PageRank is observably but not strongly correlated with actual visits made by Web users to Web pages and that our RBS algorithm[2 ] is more correlated with traffic data than PageRank in some cases .

INTRODUCTION
Link analysis of the Web graph 1 proved to be a powerful tool for supporting Web searching . On the other side , Web traffic data may be treated as a measure of merit of Web documents and is of great interest to advertising companies . We measure correlation between link analysis characteristics and actual number of visits and unique users who visited Web documents . Such measurements may be regarded as a method of evaluation or comparison of ranking algorithms , or tuning their parameters . On the other hand , discovering link analysis characteristic which is highly correlated with actual Web traffic would be of great interest for researchers and commercial subjects .
2 . DATA AND PREPROCESSING
We have collected 7 disjoint Polish Web subgraphs from January 2005 , about 3 millions nodes each , constituting the majority of the current Polish Web . We also collected the

All this data was kindly permitted to the author by 3 Polish Internet companies 2 . All multiple , intra document and intra domain links were originally removed , which made the graphs extremely sparse ( step 0 ) . Further preprocessing and data unification was done by the author and concerned : removal of isolated nodes ( step 1 ) , url aggregation over the query part ( since the queries were originally removed on the traffic data side)(step 2 ) , removal of non http protocol ( since all graph side data was httptype ) aggregating urls over the “ fragment ” part ( starting with the # symbol ) ( step 3 ) , graph nodes renumbering , etc . Finally , the intersection of traffic and graph urls made the experimental data sets even smaller ( step 4 ) ( see table 1 ) . The resulting 7 data sets , g1 , , g7 , were much smaller Web subgraphs but were fully equipped with the traffic data . Next , for each of them we computed 4 vectors representing in degree , out degree , visits and users values for each page , respectively . We computed , visualized and inspected value distributions for all these 28 vectors . The distributions and values ranges on graph and traffic sides turned out to be quite different and all heavy tailed . Thus , for further experiments , we decided to use robust Spearman(s ) rank order correlation measure ( and Kendalls(k ) Tau , were possible3 ) besides linear correlation(c ) coefficient . Users and visits vectors for each fixed graph turned out to be highly mutually correlated : 0.92 ( s ) , 0.79(k ) , 0.5(c ) , but because of their different distributions , they represented different information .

We can see some interesting patterns in the table . Correlation is not strong , but definitely positive4 . Generally , indegree is more correlated with traffic data than out degree . Moreover , in degree seems to be slightly more correlated with number of users than number of visits . This interesting result can be interpreted as pages having more inlinks are more likely to be discovered by Web users . On the other hand , out degree seems to be slightly more correlated with visits rather than users . Both these positive correlations might be interpreted as users may prefer pages with more out links as being better hubs . The observed values , however , are not high enough to infer such conclusions with certainty . Note that linear coefficient is much less stable than more robust spearman and kendalls tau measures .
Next series of experiments was devoted to compare PageRank and RBS [ 2 ] wrt correlation with the traffic data . PageRank , having one parameter 0 < d < 1 , called damping factor[1 ] , is based on a simple model of random surfer [ 1 ] . RBS extends this model by including back steps made by surfers5 . RBS has an additional parameter 0 < b < 1 , d+b ≤ 1 , called back , representing probability of back step . When back is set to 0 , RBS is identical to PageRank.The author thinks that it is very interesting to experimentally check how precisely these two algorithms model the behavior of the real surfers of the Web . For each of the 7 graphs , about 60 different6 RBS score vectors were generated , each for different parameters values7 . For each such a score vector of each graph its spearman and linear coefficient correlation with corresponding visits and users vector ( in the same graph ) was computed . Due to space limitations , here we report only the maximal observed correlation values ( table 3 ) .
In general , PageRank is observably correlated with traf

Surprisingly , damping values giving the best correlation are often much higher than 0.15 the value reportedly ( eg [ 1 ] ) used in practice . In most cases , maximum correlation was observed for back=0 , ( iewhen RBS= PageRank ) . However , in 8 cases8 maximum was achieved for non zero value of back parameter , what means that RBS can better than PageRank model real Web traffic .
The author suspects that RBS will give even better results on denser graphs ( eg without intra domain links removal ) . The methodology presented in this paper may be used for evaluating , comparing or tuning other ranking algorithms . The author also thinks that applying more subtle techniques may reveal more traffic prediction power in link analysis if even very coarse , global measures described here resulted in quite promising results .
