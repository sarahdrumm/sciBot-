ABSTRACT In this paper , we propose a web browsing support system , called WPM , which provides marking and anchoring functions on ordinary web browsers . WPM users can mark words and phrases on web pages by using their browsers without any extra plug ins like similar systems , and can anchor words to refer them later . WPM makes it possible to carry out marking to the existing Web page so that marking carried out to paper . By changing character decoration partially , the text is indicated by emphasis and improve readability . WPM is implemented using proxy agent . This system can be used in everyday browsing , without a user being conscious of a system by using a proxy .

INTRODUCTION
In the real world , people often highlight important or/and interesting text with a marker pen on paper . We call this act marking . By marking , it becomes possible to find the important portion of a document immediately , and readability of a document and reusability improve . If marking can be similarly used in a Web page , it will be thought that it leads to the increase in efficiency of Web browsing . ( cid:633 )
We developed a system which realizes marking on the web page called Web Page Marker(WPM ) . This system indicates

There are Google Toolbar[1 ] and a Mozilla Firefox[2 ] as an existing tool with a similar function . Google Toolbar has the function which indicates the word used for reference by highlight . Firefox is a Web browser with an emphasis display function in the reference in a page . Since WPM is not the function or plug in of a browser , there is no necessity of preparing plug in and special software . Moreover , since marking can be carried out in operation by the mouse , the input by the keyboard is unnecessary .
2 . WPM : WEB PAGE MARKER
WPM is a system which makes it possible to carry out marking to the existing Web page by operation on a web browser . By choosing a text with a mouse , the font of the selected portion , a background color , a character color , character size , etc . are changed . Since operation of this system is performed by operation similar to carrying out marking to paper , it is intelligible for a user . Whole character size and a whole font can be changed by the function of a browser . On the other hand , the arbitrary parts which the user chose can be changed in WPM . Moreover , WPM has an anchor creation function to the page which carried out marking . By enabling creation of an anchor in arbitrary parts , the ease of reading is improved and revisit is supported .
IMPLEMENTATION
3 . 3.1 Excution Example
Figure 1 shows an example of marking using WPM . First , the user selects the target text “ World Wide Web ” , by mouse dragging in the Web browser(Figure 1 (a) ) . Next , he/she clicks the right mouse button to carry on marking(Figure 1(b) ) . When the user does marking to some particular text , the same text else where on the same page is automatically marked . The user can grasp visually where of a page the word which carried out marking is contained . A portion to see only by marking a page scroll can be specified without reading the text of a Web page by carrying out marking on an interested keyword or the text .
1012 Figure 1 : Excution Example of WPM
First , the selected text on the browser is acquired by Java Script . Second , the marking mechanism searches for the text from HTML file by pattern matching . On the Web browser , marking to the selected text is immediately carried out by this processing . By the function described as “ onClick ” , a click of the text by which marking was carried out calls the processing of which marking is canceled . The above processing can perform execution/release of marking easily .
Marking reflection to other pages By using JavaScript and DOM , marking is realizable as mentioned above . However , the changed contents will be lost by reload/unload of a page in JavaScript . Since information is saved , this system performs the following processing . When marking is carried out , information for marking(selected text , character decoration ) is stored in a database . When load a Web page , proxy agent outputs JavaScript objects . Processing the outputted objects at the time of “ onLoad ” , the past marking is reflected in a page .
This processing is used also for an anchor creation function . Creation of an anchor is performed by the same operation as marking . This function adds anchor(A ) tag which specified the name attribute to be the part which the user selected . In usual , in order to access with an anchor , the anchor tag must be beforehand created by the author of a page . In WPM , the user can create an anchor in arbitrary parts by embedding an anchor tag in the part which carried out marking . 4 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper , we proposed a system which enables user to marking on Web page like marking on papers . Advantages of wpm can be described as follows ; ( 1)In arbitrary Web pages , marking is made possible , ( 2)It can use from the usual web browser and there is no necessity that a user prepares plug in and special software .

Figure 2 : Architecture of WPM
3.2 Architecture of WPM
Figure 2 shows the system architecture of WPM , which is based on proxy agent and marking mechanism implemented by JavaScript . The proxy agent is implemented using MiLog[3 ] , which is an multi agent development environment that is familiar with WWW .
The proxy agent analyses the HTTP header sent from the Web browser to get the URL . The agent then downloads the HTML files for the URL . Next , proxy agent adds marking mechanism to the HEAD tag of each HTML file . By this processing , a marking mechanism can be called from on a Web browser . When a text is chosen on a browser , the marking mechanism will change the character decoration on a browser . The information used for marking is stored in the database which the proxy agent has . 3.3 Implementation Marking processing on the Web browser WPM realizes marking by inserting the tag which specified the style attribute . ( cid:633 ) An exsample of tag for marking is as follows : <span style="background color:FFC000" name = "wpm" onClick = "clearMarking();"> selected text
</span>
