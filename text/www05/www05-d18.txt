ABSTRACT PageRank is defined as the stationary state of a Markov chain obtained by perturbing the transition matrix of a web graph with a damping factor ff that spreads part of the rank . The choice of ff is eminently empirical , but most applications use ff D 0:85 ; nonetheless , the selection of ff is critical , and some believe that link farms may use this choice adversarially . Recent results [ 1 ] prove that the PageRank of a page is a rational function of ff , and that this function can be approximated quite efficiently : this fact can be used to define a new form of ranking , TotalRank , that averages PageRanks over all possible ff ’s . We show how this rank can be computed efficiently , and provide some preliminary experimental results on its quality and comparisons with PageRank .

INTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATIONS PageRank [ 5 ] is one of the most important ranking techniques used in today ’s search engines : it is simple , robust , reliable and it can be computed in a quite efficient manner . PageRank is defined formally as the stationary distribution of a stochastic process whose states are the nodes of a web graph ( aka web pages ) . The process itself is obtained by combining ( a row normalised version of ) the adjacency matrix of the web graph with a trivial uniform process that is needed to make the combination irreducible and aperiodic , so that the stationary distribution is well defined . The combination depends on a damping factor ff 2 T0 ; 1/ .
Let r.ff/ denote the PageRank vector for a given ff ; r.0/ is actually a uniform vector1 , whereas limff!1 r.ff/ tends to concentrate all the rank in few pages , sometimes called “ rank sinks ” .
In [ 5 ] , Brin and Page suggested using r.0:85/ , and indeed this choice has remained by far the most common ; there are empirical evidences that this value gives good ranks , and some a posteriori reasons for choosing a damping factor around :80 . Nonetheless , some authors recently observed that studying how the PageRank of a given page changes with ff can be used to detect link spam [ 6 ] ; in principle , this observation may be exploited to use a specific value of ff adversarially to build link farms . 1For sake of simplicity , in this abstract we assume that the preference vector is uniform ; all results carry over to the more general case .

A way to avoid this danger would be averaging the PageRank value over all possible ff ’s : this new form of ranking , that we call TotalRank , is made possible by recent results [ 1 ] that show how PageRank can be approximated as a function . This abstract introduces TotalRank and presents some preliminary results about its quality and some comparisons with PageRank .
2 . DEFINITION AND ALGORITHM
In the following , let r.ff/ denote the PageRank vector as a function of ff . Recall that r.ff/ is a rational vector function of ff with no singularities in T0 ; 1/ , so the following definition makes sense :
T D R 1
DEFINITION 1 . The TotalRank vector T is defined as follows : 0 r.ff/dff ( where the integral is interpreted componentwise ) . In other words , the TotalRank of a page is the area behind the PageRank curve for that page , as ff ranges on T0 ; 1/ . To explain how TotalRank can be efficiently computed , recall that the simplest algorithm to approximate PageRank is based on the Power Method [ 5 ] ( and , indeed , most known algorithms to compute PageRank are just variants of the Power Method ) ; let Rk ( for k D 0 ; 1 ; : : : ) be the k th approximation computed by the Power Method for some ( fixed but arbitrary ) value ff0 of ff , and set R,1 D 0 by convention .

( [1] ) . The Maclaurin expansion of PageRank is 0 for all k D kD0 ck ffk where ck D .Rk , Rk,1/=ffk

This result allows one to compute TotalRank using essentially the same classical Power Method algorithm commonly employed for PageRank , with an extra vector to accumulate total ranks ; an implementation is distributed under the Gnu Public License at the website http://lawdsiunimiit
3 . COMPARISONS WITH PAGERANK
In this section , we want to provide quantitative comparisons between TotalRank and PageRank based on experimental results . Experiments have been performed on three different datasets : a snapshot of the Italian web .it ( 41 Mpages ) , a partial snapshot of the British web .uk ( 18 Mpages ) and the public 2001 crawl performed by the WebBase crawler ( 118 Mpages ) ; all data are publicly available from http://lawdsiunimiit : graphs are
898 compressed in the WebGraph format [ 2 ] , and the first two datasets where gathered using UbiCrawler .
Comparing quantitatively different ranking techniques is a difficult task , and its results are open to interpretations : establishing that two rankings are different is not sufficient per se to determine which one is better . We are going to provide some measures that should convince the reader that TotalRank and PageRank provide quite different rankings ; then , we show some hints that TotalRank gives results of good quality , and probably better than those obtained with standard PageRank ( ie , PageRank with ff D 0:85 ) . Comparison using Kendall ’s . As a first comparative evaluation , we computed PageRank for different values of ff and compared the resulting ranks with the ones obtained by TotalRank on the same graph ; the comparison was performed using Kendall ’s [ 4 ] , a nonparametric correlation index that measures similarity between two rankings . Figure 1 shows the results obtained for our datasets : as the reader can see , TotalRank is maximally similar with PageRank when ff is about 0:7 , but even in that case never exceeds 0:97 .

Comparing the top k fraction . One objection to the usage of Kendall ’s as a measure of ( dis)similarity is that it weights in the same way all nodes ; alternative proposals advocate limiting the comparison to the “ most important ” pages . This idea can be implemented in different ways [ 3 ] ; one possible measure ( called intersection metric ) is computed as follows : let At and Bt be the set of the top t pages according to the rankings we want to compare , and let ffi0.t / D jAt 4Bt j=.2t / where 4 denotes the symmetric set difference ; let also ffi.k/ be the average of all ffi0.t / when t k . Note that ffi.k/ D 0 if the top k lists coincide , whereas ffi.k/ D 1 if they are completely disjoint . Figure 2 shows the results obtained comparing TotalRank with standard PageRank : as you can see , the dissimilarity tends to increase up to 20 % in the first few thousandths of pages , and then it goes down to zero , as it should . Number of homepages . Table 1 presents the number of homepages ( URLs whose file portion is either empty or index|home.* ) that are ranked among the top k by TotalRank and standard PageRank ; the reader may observe that TotalRank finds in all cases a larger number of homepages . Since usually homepages are more important than internal pages , these data indicate that the rankings obtained have high quality . Top movers . Table 2 shows the 10 pages that moved further up or down in TotalRank order with respect to standard PageRank order . Observe , for example , that http://tukidstucowscom/ is advanced to position 99 ( it was ranked 281th according to PageRank ) , as well as the homepage of the University of Melbourne ( advanced
