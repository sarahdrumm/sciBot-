ABSTRACT Association search is to search for certain instances in semantic web and then make inferences from and about the instances we have found . In this paper , we propose the problem of association search and our preliminary solution for it using Bayesian network . We first minutely define its categorization . We then define tasks in association search . In terms of Bayesian network , we take ontology taxonomy as network structure in Bayesian network . We use the query log of instances to estimate the network parameters . After the Bayesian network is constructed , we give the solution for association search in the network . the association search and

Semantic Search[1 ] searches the objects instead of texts . The search results are instances in the knowledge base . Swoogle[2 ] searches the knowledge base using keywords , the results are URIs of entities in knowledge base including concepts , properties and instances . This kind of search can be viewed as variation of the traditional search in the semantic web . The associations among instances may be direct or indirect . The direct association means that two instances are directed connected with a property . The indirect association means that two instances are connected by a set of instances and properties . Such associations are very helpful for users to understand the search results , especially on semantic web . Consider the domain of computer science department which contains the concept “ Professor ” , “ lab ” , “ project ” and “ Student ” . A search with two keywords may return the instance “ Jack ” which belongs to the concept “ Professor ” and the instance “ Jerry ” which

Actually it ’s just what current semantic web search systems do . After these two instances are retrieved , users may want their associations . If fortunately , they have direct associations like the following triple : Jack hasStudent Jerry Most of existent semantic search systems success in finding the associations between them . But the association is often not directed . Current semantic search systems will give no associations between the two instances in this situation . Looking into the ontology , we may find actually there are two indirect associations : 1 )
Jack isInProject “ search engine ” ; Jerry isInProject “ search engine ” . Jack and Jerry can be associated via “ search engine ” . Jack inSameLabWith Mike ; Mike hasStudent Eric ; Eric isMemberOf “ football team ” ; Jerry isMemberOf “ football team ” . Jack and Jerry can be associated via the instances Mike , Eric and “ football team ” .

2 . Problem Statement Now we formally define the association search problem that we are solving . We first give the definition of knowledge base in our scenario . A knowledge base can be viewed as a three tupel :
KB =
PCI ,(
,
) where C denotes the set of concepts ; P denotes the set of property ; I denotes the instance set of all concepts . Specially , let ci ∈ denote a concept , ii ∈ I denote an instance of concept
Pp ∈ denote a property and
C ic .
We now define the Association Search on the semantic web . Definition 1 . Given a knowledge base KB and a user ’s query q is represented by a set of keyword q={ki} , the task of association search is to : ( 1 ) Search for instances Iq related to q . Let Iki={iki} denote the set ik as one of of instances that whose URIs contain the keyword their sub strings . We have

If instance i contains both ki and kj , then we define the association between ki and kj as Null Association ( also denoted as AØ=(i , null , i ) ) for the given instance i ;
992 If instances iki and ikj are related by a property p , then we the association between ki and kj as Direct define Association ( also denoted as AD= ( iki , p , ikj ) ) for the given instances iki and ikj ;
If instances iki and ikj do not have any direct relation , then our target is to find the Indirect Association between iki and ikj ( denoted as a set AΦ={(iki , pa , ij ) , {(ii , pm , ij)} , ( ij , pb , ikj)} ) , which constructs a relation path from iki to ikj via Intermediate Association AI={(ii , pi , ij)} .
( 3 ) Rank all possible associations for the query q . Given all possible associations ( including Null Association , Direct Association , Indirect Association ) , represent them to the user by a ranked list according to their “ relevance ” to the query . It has been carefully studied that the average number of keywords used in web search is 2.35 [ 3 ] . Thus , to facilitate the illustration , we focus on the scenario of two keywords in association search in the rest of the paper . Generalizing our approach to multiple keywords is straightforward . 3 . Our Approach Here we present our approach for association search . Concerning the query with two keywords , ie q={k1 , k2} , we concentrate on how to do an association search . Association search needs to aware the graph structure of the domain knowledge . Bayesian network is a compact graphical representation of joint probability distributions . It permits the explicit encoding of conditional independencies in a natural manner . Thus , Intuition shows that Bayesian network can be useful for association search . A Bayesian network consists of two components – the graph structure and the parameters [ 4 ] . In our case , ontology on the semantic web naturally provides the graph structure for Bayesian network . Hence , our focus is the parameter estimation and inference on it . We first present how to model our problem by Bayesian network , and then simply describe the parameter estimation , finally illustrate how the association search is realized in Bayesian network . 3.1 Bayesian Network based Association Search Model In terms of Bayesian networks , given two instances 1i and 2i association from 1i to 2i If the probability is zero , it means that there is no association from 1i to 2i . If the value of the probability is not zero , it means that there are one or more associations from 1i to 2i 3.2 Association Search in Bayesian Network After the Bayesian network of the domain is constructed , the association search can be performed . The association search includes the following aspects : searching the instances by keywords , association finding between instances and calculating association scores . The traditional web search technology is used to perform the instance search . An instance is processed as a document . The search takes the keywords {k1 , k2} and searches for I1={ik1} ( containing k1 ) and I2={ik2} ( containing k2 ) in the knowledge base . Instead of returning a document list , it returns the instance list . The association finding includes two steps . Given two instances ik1 and ik2 , if they are the same instance , which means there is a can be defined as p(i1|i2 ) .
, the two

Null Association between them , we quantify the relevance by P(ik1 ) . Otherwise , we quantify its relevance by P(ik2|ik1 ) . P(ik2|ik1 ) can be rewritten as : iP ( k

For direct association , computing its score is straightforward . For indirect association with the intermediate association AI={(ii , pi , ij)} , we can compute P(ik2,ik1 ) by : Λ iP (

We plan to represent the search results by visualized path ( corresponding to association ) using JUNG ( http://jungsourceforgenet ) , a graph render engine . One of versions at http://kegcstsinghuaeducn/project/pswmphtm 4 . Conclusion Semantic search is becoming one of the most crucial challenges on semantic web . The inherence of semantic web determines that to directly adapt the traditional search to semantic web is not so reasonable . In this paper , we propose the problem of association search on semantic web for the first time . We think that association search should be one important kind of semantic search . We give a complete definition of association search from three aspects . We also present our preliminary solution for the problem by using Bayesian network . Specially , we describe how we construct the Bayesian network structure by ontology , how we learn the parameters in the Bayesian model and how we use the network to infer the association .
