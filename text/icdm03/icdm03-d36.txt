SVM based
Support vector machine ( SVM ) has appeared as a powerful tool for forecasting forex market and demonstrated better performance over other methods , eg , neural network or ARIMA based model . forecasting model necessitates the selection of appropriate kernel function and values of free parameters : regularization parameter and ε– insensitive loss function . In this paper , we investigate the effect of different kernel functions , namely , linear , polynomial , radial basis and spline on prediction error measured by several widely used performance metrics . The effect of regularization parameter is also studied . The prediction of six different foreign currency exchange rates against Australian dollar has been performed and analyzed . Some interesting results are presented .
1 . Introduction
Exchange rate prediction is one of the challenging applications of modern time series forecasting and very important for the success of many businesses and financial institutions . The rates are inherently noisy , non stationary and deterministically chaotic [ 12 ] . One general assumption is made in such cases is that the historical data incorporate all those behaviour . As a result , the historical data is the major input to the prediction process . There are several forecasting techniques available ; those are developed mainly based on different assumptions , mathematical foundations and specific model parameters . However , for better result , it is important to find the appropriate technique for a given forecasting task . For more than two decades , Box and Jenkins’ AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average ( ARIMA ) technique [ 1 ] has been widely used for time series forecasting . However , ARIMA is a general univariate model and it is developed based on the assumption that the time series being forecasted are linear and stationary [ 2 ] . In recent years , Neural Networks has found useful applications in financial time series analysis and forecasting [ 9 ] , [ 11 14 ] . In several applications , Tang and Fishwich [ 9 ] , Jhee and Lee [ 5 ] , Wang and Leu [ 11 ] , Hill et al . [ 4 ] , Kamruzzaman and Sarker [ 6 ] and many other researchers have shown that ANNs perform better than ARIMA models , specifically , for more irregular series and for multiple period ahead forecasting . Zhang and Hu [ 14 ] analysed backpropagation neural networks' ability to forecast an exchange rate . Recently , Yao et al . [ 12 ] evaluated the capability of a backpropagation neural network model as forecasting tool of Singapore forex market . Medeiros [ 8 ] proposed neuro coeficient smooth transition autoregression to model and forecast monthly exchange rate time series . Zimmermann et al . [ 13 ] developed a neural network modelling to analyse the decisions and interaction of multiple agents to capture the price dynamics of multiple forex market . In [ 6 ] , Kamruzzaman and Sarker investigated three into using based forecasting models

However , there are several disadvantages for NN based model : ( i ) dependency on a large number of parameters , e.g , network size , learning parameters and initial weight chosen , ( ii ) possibility of being trapped in a very slow convergence , and ( iii ) over fitting on training data resulting in poor generalization ability . local minima resulting and
Recent research has been directed to Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) which has emerged as a new and powerful technique for learning from data and in particular for solving classification regression problems with better performance [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 10 ] . Study in [ 7 ] with Australian forex data showed better forecasting of exchange rate by SVM based model compared to NN based model . The main advantage of SVM is its ability to minimize structural risk as opposed to empirical risk minimization as employed by the NN system . This paper reports a further investigation of the study in [ 6 7 ] . One aim of this paper is to investigate the effect of various kernel functions on predicting forex market . Forecasting performance is evaluated in term of five commonly and upward/downward trend of the market . The effect of selecting free parameters of SVMs on prediction error is also investigated . 2 . Support Vector Machine Regression Model used metrics measuring accuracy
SVMs originate from Vapnik ’s statistical learning theory [ 10 ] , and their major advantage over NN is that they formulate the regression problem as a quadratic optimization problem . SVMs perform by nonlinearly mapping the input data into a high dimensional feature space by means of a kernel function and then do the linear regression in the transformed space . The whole process results in nonlinear regression in the low dimensional space .

In SVM regression , Vapnik proposed the use of ε insensitive loss function where error below is not penalized , ε being known a priori .

The first term describes the ε insensitive loss function and the second term is a measure of function flatness . The constant C>0 is a regularized constant determining the tradeoff between the training error and model flatness .

3 . Forecasting Model and Evaluation
In recent forecasting methodologies .
Technical and fundamental analyses are the two major times , financial technical analysis has drawn particular academic interest due to the increasing evidence that markets are less efficient than was originally thought . In this study , we used time delay moving average as technical data . The advantage of moving average is its tendency to smooth out some of the irregularity that exits between market days [ 12 ] . We used moving average values of past weeks to build SVM model to predict following week ’s rate . The indicators are MA5 ( moving average on 5 days ) , MA10 , MA20 , MA60 , MA120 and Xi , last week's closing rate . Exchange rate for the period i+1 is predicted . These six indicators are used as inputs to construct support vectors .
Forecasting performance of the above model is evaluated against six widely used statistical metrics [ 7 ] , namely , Normalized Mean Square Error ( NMSE ) , Mean Absolute Error ( MAE ) , Directional Symmetry ( DS ) , Correct Up trend ( CU ) and Correct Down trend ( CD ) . NMSE and MAE measure the deviation between actual and forecasted value . Smaller values of these metrics indicate higher accuracy in forecasting . DS measures correctness in predicted directions . CU and CD measure the correctness of predicted upward trend and downward trend , respectively . Higher values of DS , CU and CD indicate correctness in trend prediction . A detail formulation of these metrics are presented in [ 6 ] .
4 . Experimental Results and Analysis
In this study , we experimented with foreign currency exchange rate of US dollar , British Pound , Japanese Yen , Singapore dollar , New Zealand dollar and Swiss Franc against Australian dollar from January 1991 to July 2002 . The available data was divided in training and test set . In total 565 weekly data was considered of which first 500 weekly data was used as training set and the remaining 56 weekly data as test set to evaluate the model . Since no analytical method is available to determine the most suitable kernel for a particular data set , kernel type is arbitrarily chosen by the user . We experimented with four different kernel functions , namely , linear , polynomial , radial basis and spline , on the same data set to investigate the effect of kernel type . Other aim of this study is to investigate the variation of performance with respect to regularization parameter C . In this experiment C was varied from a very small value ( 0.1 ) to very large value ( 105 ) and ε was arbitrarily chosen to be 10 3 . In the first set of our experiment , NSME , MAE , DS , CU and CD were calculated using the forecast obtained by SVM and the available historical ( /test ) data over 35 weeks and 65 weeks , for each of six different currency rates against Australian dollars , using four different kernel functions ( linear , polynomial , radial Basis , and spline ) . Figure 1(a)~(e ) illustrates these performance metrics over 35 weeks and Figure 2(a)~(e ) illustrates those over 65 weeks . As found in Fig 1 & 2 , no single kernel function dominates all currency prediction . This outcome encourages us to analyze each currency independently .
First of all , we consider JPY which is the most fluctuating currency . The actual exchange rate of JPY is much lower at the end compared to the beginning of the period with many sharp jumps and drops in between . Based on NSME and MAE , Spline kernel seems performing better though polynomial kernel looks also promising for NSME only . A plot of historical data shows that the actual end of period rates of other currencies are also lower , but not as low as JPY compared to their start rates . The gap between the start rates of USD and GBP is higher than their gap between the end rates . However the change in rates for both USD and GBP looks like slow but random fluctuation with no sharp up and down . Based on the predicted error , the linear kernel is the best for USD . On the other hand , the performances of linear and polynomial kernels are very close for GBP . The actual start rates of NZD and SGD are very close , and the CHF rate is lower than these two . The end rates of SGD and CHF are somewhat close , but the NZD rate is much higher than these two currencies . Interestingly , the rates of these three currencies are almost same for 30 40 weeks at the middle of the time horizon . These three rates favor polynomial kernel based on the predicted error . That means , the polynomial kernel can be recognized as the suitable kernel in predicting exchange rate for all currencies except US dollar in this experiment . This trend in predicted error over 35 weeks ( Fig 1(a)~(b ) ) is very much consistent with the same over 65 week prediction ( Fig 2(a)~(b) ) .
Figure 1(c)~(e ) show that , in term of trend prediction , linear kernel is not clearly superior in any of the cases . With respect to directional change , Fig 1(c ) shows that radial basis kernel yields best result for JPY , NZD and CHF whereas polynomial kernel produces better result for USD and SGD . The maximum difference in term of correct directional changes produced by radial basis and polynomial kernel is about 28 % Fig 1(d)~(e ) show that radial basis and polynomial kernels performs equally in case of three currencies in term of CU and four currencies in term of CD . Similar trend is also observed for 65 weeks prediction as illustrated in Fig 2(c)~(d ) . From the directional accuracy point of view , it appears that radial basis or polynomial would be a better choice of kernel function .
Based on all the performance metrics , there is no single winner for kernel function . This can not be a convincing conclusion for practitioners . Ideally , a SVM that minimizes the prediction errors while maximizing the coverage of directional matching would be the most attractive method . However , in practice , it may happen one of the following : 1 ) The minimum possible prediction errors but lower coverage of directional matching than one or more kernel functions , 2 ) The maximum possible directional accuracy but higher prediction errors than one or more kernel functions .
In addition , it could be more complicated when one prediction error is minimum and the other is not . Similar situation can be thought for the directional indicators too . The directional indicators check only the matching of trends in each every time unit/week irrespective of their deviations . Suppose the actual trend in a given week is upward and the forecast trend is also upward with a deviational error E1 . As per the deviational indicators , this is a 100 % coverage/ success for the given week . Now suppose the forecast trend is downward with a deviational error E2 . That means there is no success ( 0 % ) in terms of deviational indicators . If E2 < E1 , the predicted error indicators would favour the later case . However , from the practical point of view , the forecast in the first case is still showing gain whereas the second case is showing loss . This is not a good situation for short term forecasting . In the long term forecasting , if the predicted error is minimum and the directional indicators are accurate for most time units , then the forecast can be accepted . In our case study , the coverage of DS , CU and CD is more than 80 % for most cases and no one is less than 73 % .
Although the polynomial kernel performs better than the other three kernels for most currencies considered in this study , we believe the kernel function should be chosen based on the pattern of individual currency rate . In other words , no single kernel is suitable for forecasting all currency rates .
Figure 3 ( a)~(c ) illustrates prediction error of Japanese Yen vs regularization error C with linear kernel . Fig 3(a ) shows that NMSE drops from 0.06 to 0.035 when C is increased from 0.5 to 50 . For any value larger than 50 , NMSE remains the similar behaviour in Fig 3(b ) . Fig 3(c ) shows that DS varies from the same . MAE exhibits
75.4 % to 83.0 % when C is increased from 0.5 to 7.0 , later DS remains 81.54 % as C increases further . Similar behaviour is observed for other kernels also . This indicates little impact on variation of prediction error with respect to regularization parameter . 5 . Conclusions
This paper investigates the performance of support vector machine for Australian forex forecasting in terms of kernel type and sensitivity of free parameters selection . In reducing total prediction error ( MNSE and AME ) polynomial kernel produced the best result while in predicting trend ( DS , CU and CD ) radial basis and polynomial kernel produced equally good results . In general radial basis and polynomial kernel appeared to be a better choice in forecasting forex market in this study . However , kernel function should be chosen based on the behavior of the pattern of historical rates of individual currency . Over a wide range of values for regularization parameter C , support vectors remain exactly the same and hence do not affect the performance at all , however , showed some sensitivity over a small range of value . Further improvement in performance may be achieved by selecting complex or mixed kernel function and is currently under investigation . 6 . References
