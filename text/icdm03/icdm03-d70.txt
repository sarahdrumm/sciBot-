Abstract
We note that a set of statistically “ unusual ” proteinprofile pairs in experimentally determined database of protein protein interactions can typify protein protein interactions , and propose a novel method called PICUPP that sifts such protein profile pairs using a statistical simulation . It is demonstrated that unusual Pfam and InterPro profile pairs can be extracted from the DIP database using a bootstrapping approach . We particularly illustrate that such protein profile pairs can be used for predicting putative pairs of interacting proteins . Their prediction accuracies are around 86 % and 90 % when InterPro and Pfam profiles are used , respectively at 75 % confidence level .
1 . Introduction
Protein protein identification of its physiological replication/transcription , interactions are fundamental to cellular processes . They are responsible for phenomena like DNA regulation of metabolic pathways , immunologic recognition , signal transduction , etc . The interacting proteins is therefore an important prerequisite step in understanding function . From a computational standpoint , the problem is how we can predict that two proteins interact from their structures or sequence information . Various computational methods using genomic context alone have recently been designed to address this problem ( see reviews in [ 1 , 2] ) . They are based on gene fusion events [ 3 , 4 ] , conservation of gene order or co occurrence of genes in potential operons [ 5 , 6 ] , and presence/absence of genes in different species [ 7 ] . All these methods attempt to identify functionally associated genes ( for example , involvement in the same biochemical pathway or similar gene regulation ) . However , they provide only a small coverage of direct physical interactions [ 8 ] , which is more inherent to experimental approaches .
In parallel to genomic context based developments , a number of computational methods that attempt to “ learn ” from experimental data of interacting proteins have been reported in the literature [ 9 , 10 ] . Sprinzak and Margalit [ 10 ] tried to learn what typifies interacting protein pairs by analyzing over representation of from sequence signature pairs derived available experimental data of interacting proteins . Bock and Gough [ 9 ] attempted to learn correlations between biochemical patterns of sequence pairs derived from experimentally verified positive set and artificially manufactured “ negative ” set ( a set of putative “ noninteracting ” protein pairs ) . for an important biologically
Protein Interaction Classification by Unlikely Profile Pair ( PICUPP ) our proposed method extracts protein interaction indicators from positive proteinprotein interaction data ( no negative instances ) . It particularly seeks to identify correlated protein profile pairs as indicators of protein protein interactions . A profile describes a protein domain or family that may perform functions . Here “ correlated ” indicates that co occurrence of the two given profiles accounts interaction . We particularly choose to use unusual protein profile pairs , which are derived from statistical simulation using interacting protein pairs , as such correlated pairs . A pair of profiles is then identified as a correlated pair , if its occurrence(s ) in the data is statistically unusual relative to its occurrence generated by random ( independent ) protein pairings . Whenever the context is clear , we will use correlated and unusual interchangeably henceforth . The proposed approach is investigated with various protein profiles : Pfam domains [ 11 ] , InterPro signatures [ 12 ] and Blocks motifs [ 13 ] using the Database of Interacting Protein ( DIP ) [ 14 ] of June 16 , 2002 .
2 . Methods
A protein sequence is typically associated with multiple profiles . Thus each interacting protein pair may contribute to a number of profile pairs . A set of protein pairs creates a table , where each cell denoted by a row and column contains the frequency count of a profile pair . Note is different from an ordinary contingency table , because each protein pair would not contribute to exactly one cell of the table . Therefore significance analysis would not standard contingency table theory with a closed form solution [ 15 ] . Because of the non standard setting of multiple cell contributions we evaluate significance by simulation . follow that it

Figure 1 : Example count distributions of unusual ( a ) and usual ( b ) Pfam profile pairs . In each case , white bars and black bars represent dr and dp distributions , respectively . X and Y axes represent count and its frequency .
The frequency counts in a profile pair table are random variables that are generated by the simulation . For each protein pair ( prk , prl ) in D , a set of profile pairs is identified by all pair wise combinations of profiles between prk and prl . For example , let proteins prk and prl be associated with profiles ( s1 , s2 ) and ( s3 , s4 ) , respectively . Then , any combination ( si , sj)∈ ( s1 , s2 ) × ( s3 , s4 ) , where × denotes Cartesian product operator , is identified as a profile pair . Since a meaningful evaluation of a random variable can only be made through its distribution , we bootstrap the table cell distributions by resampling the protein pair data D and computing many from bootstrapped samples of the same protein interaction data and the other from bootstrapped samples of the random protein pairings . This provides two count samples for each cell of the table : an interacting pairs sample , cp , and a random pairs sample , cr . We denote the corresponding empirical count distribution as dp and dr , respectively . The amount of overlap between dp and dr determines the usualness of the pair compared to what is expected at random . That is , PICUPP finds a profile pair ( a cell in the table ) to be unusual ( or , correlated ) if its frequency distribution constructed from interacting protein pair samples is significantly different from what instances of tables : one

In each figure , the sensitivities at confidence levels of 0.7 and 0.8 are shown to both positive ( P ) and randomly coupled ( R ) interactions . random protein from constructed is pairings . Computationally , PICUPP only keeps track of the dp and dr distributions for non zero counts . Technically , the confidence score , or the degree of correlation of a profile pair ( si , sj ) is computed from its two count distributions dp and dr as :

Given a set of identified unusual proteinprofile pairs , PICUPP determines a possible interaction between a pair of proteins ( prk , prl ) , if any of its profile pair is unusual . An example of unusual and usual profile pair distribution is shown in Figure 1 .
3 . Results
PICUPP is modeled by comparing statistics of the given protein interaction pairs with those expected by random pairing of proteins . Therefore , it is expected to be sensitive to the positive protein interactions while being insensitive to those random protein couples . In this section , we report the sensitivity of PICUPP when InterPro and Pfam profiles are used over protein interactions in DIP database . We also discuss how different sizes of bootstrap samples and different confidence levels affect the overall performance . for cases with
DIP database contains a rich set of protein interactions from several species . From approximately 17,000 total protein interactions , we selected proteins that have Swiss Prot annotations . As a result , the 7,655 and 6,652 protein interactions are left available for the experiment InterPro and Pfam , respectively . Figure 2 illustrates sensitivity to positive and randomly coupled interactions at the confidence levels of 0.7 and 0.8 with the different bootstrapped sample sizes . In both cases with ( a ) InterPro and ( b ) Pfam profiles , PICUPP shows high sensitivity to positive interactions , whereas low to randomly coupled protein pairs . With confidence of 80 % , the sensitivity of PICUPP to positive interactions is around 82 % ( InterPro ) and 75 % ( Pfam ) from the simulation of size 1,000 . On the other hand , it is around 17 % ( InterPro ) and 13 % ( Pfam ) to randomly coupled protein pairs . The result illustrates that PICUPP effectively identifies proteinprotein interactions .
We also measured the performance of PICUPP when it is applied to a list of interacting protein pairs that is left out during the training stage . For this , we excluded all interactions of Yeast from DIP database and trained PICUPP . Then the sensitivity ( or , accuracy ) of PICUPP to the interacting protein pairs in Yeast was measured . Likewise , the sensitivity to protein pairs in E coli was

Figure 3 (a ) and ( b ) shows the sensitivity ( coverage ) of PICUPP to Yeast protein pairs in case of InterPro and Pfam , respectively . Similarly Figures 3 (c ) and ( d ) show the coverage of E coli protein pairs . As clearly illustrated in the Figures , PICUPP was able to differentiate interacting protein pairs from randomly coupled pairs in Yeast around 57 % at confidence level of 70 % . However , it is around 20 % for interacting pairs in E coli at the same confidence level , which indicate the unusual profile pairs that typify interaction in E coli were not found by the process and may be different from what are observed in the remaining data . This can be understood by the fact that DIP database is largely biased toward Eukaryotes . Although the bacterium Escherichia coli ( E coli ) is the most dominant noneukaryote proteome in DIP database , it only accounts for 1.3 % of the proteins therein [ 9 ] .
4 . Discussion
Approximately 108 pairs of Pfam domains are identified unusual at a confidence level of 98 % . A caseby case investigation discovered many well established Pfam Pfam associations among these interactions . The SH3 domain is perhaps the best characterized member of protein interaction modules . It plays a vital role in a wide variety of biological processes . It increases the local subcellular concentration or altering the localization of components of signaling pathways , and mediates the assembly of large multiprotein complexes [ 16 ] . The SH3 is found to be correlated with Actin in our analysis . In fact it has been verified that this domain is often closely associated with Actin ( in cytoskeletal proteins , such as fodrin and yeast actincytoskeletal proteins , such as fodrin and yeast actin binding protein ABP 1 [ 17] ) .
G protein beta WD 40 repeat ( G
) , another well
, known interaction module , is one of the three subunits ( , and gamma ) of the guanine nucleotide binding proteins ( G proteins ) which act as intermediaries in the transduction of signals generated by transmembrane receptors . The subunit binds to and hydrolyzes GTP ; the and gamma subunits seem to be required for the replacement of GDP by GTP as well as for membrane anchoring and receptor recognition . We found that this domain is highly coupled with Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein ( sm protein ) in our analysis . This finding is consistent with previous research results [ 18 ] . Both the sm proteins and Gpossibly mediate regulated protein protein interactions essential for the functions of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins ( snRNPs ) . Additional well known Pfam pairs found in our prediction include actin and Cofilin/tropomyosin type actin binding protein [ 19 ] , Protein kinase domain and Fibroblast growth factor [ 20 ] , and EF hand and Myosin head ( motor domain ) [ 21 ] .
5 . Conclusion pairs protein profile
A statistical approach to identify correlated proteinprofile pairs that account for protein interactions is presented with experimental validation . We demonstrate that the proposed approach , PICUPP , effectively maximizes statistical confidences given to correlated protein profile pairs by applying a bootstrapping approach to an incomplete data . We show that a set of inferred unusual from experimentally determined protein interactions can indeed epitomize putative protein protein interactions . Such unusual protein profile pairs reveal interacting domains and uncover relationships between highly correlated/uncorrelated domains for protein interactions . PICUPP needs to be further refined in several ways . First , its performance highly depends on the quality of the experimental data . Unfortunately genome scale experimental methods , such as protein arrays and twohybrid system , have many limitations intrinsic to the experimental design . Another limitation , and even more restrictive , is the binary nature of some of those experimental approaches , which potentially excludes many of the cellular machines that are multi protein complexes . Moreover , transient ( short living ) protein complexes probably comprising a significant fraction of all regulatory interactions in the cell may need additional relationships between stabilization for detection by these experimental methods . Thus , expanding the training set with various types of annotated protein interactions will potentially address this problem . Second , an accurate understanding of interactions between protein profiles and how these interactions affect interactions between proteins is very limited . A possible solution may involve moving away from somewhat “ ad hoc ” utilization of protein profiles to more systematic approaches leading to a comprehensive understanding of interacting protein profiles and interacting proteins .
