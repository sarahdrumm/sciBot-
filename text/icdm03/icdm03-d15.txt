Abstract
We explore in this paper the efficient clustering of item data . Different from those of the traditional data , the features of item data are known to be of high dimensionality and sparsity . In view of the features of item data , we devise in this paper a novel measurement , called the associationtaxonomy similarity , and utilize this measurement to perform the clustering . With this association taxonomy similarity measurement , we develop an efficient clustering algorithm , called algorithm AT ( standing for AssociationTaxonomy ) , for item data . Two validation indexes based on association and taxonomy properties are also devised to assess the quality of clustering for item data . As validated by the real dataset , it is shown by our experimental results that algorithm AT devised in this paper significantly outperforms the prior works in the clustering quality as measured by the validation indexes , indicating the usefulness of association taxonomy similarity in item data clustering .
1 Introduction
Data clustering is an important technique for exploratory data analysis . Data clustering is an application dependent issue and certain applications may call for their own specific requirements . Different from those of the traditional data , the features of market basket data are known to be of high dimensionality and sparsity . There are several clustering technologies which addressed the issue of clustering market basket data [ 2][3][4][5 ] .
Explicitly , the support of item ( cid:108 ) is defined as the percentage of transactions which contain ( cid:108 ) . Note that in mining association rules , a large item is basically an item with frequent occurrence in transactions . Thus , item ( cid:108 ) is called a large item if the support of item ( cid:108 ) is larger than the pre given minimum support threshold . In market basket data , the taxonomy of items defines the generalization relationships for the concepts in different abstraction levels .

In this paper , we devise the techniques of clustering item data sets for fulfilling both the guidance and recommendation purposes which is shown in Figure 1 . By using the taxonomy of items , it is shown in Figure 1(a ) that shelf space is intuitively organized to guide customers to find the items according to the corresponding categories . In addition , it is shown in Figure 1(b ) that association rules of items are used for item recommendation in the electronic commerce environments . In view of the features of item data , it is shown in Figure 1(c ) that we devise in this paper a novel measurement , called the association taxonomy similarity , and utilize this measurement to perform the clustering for shelf space organization . With this association taxonomy similarity measurement , we develop an efficient clustering algorithm , called algorithm AT ( standing for Association Taxonomy ) , for item data in the following .
2 Preliminaries

( cid:87 ) ( cid:76)( ) = where ( cid:87 ) ( (cid:108 ) , ( cid:108 ) ) is the taxonomy value of item ( cid:108 ) and item ( cid:108 ) . Explicitly , ( cid:87 ) ( (cid:108 ) , ( cid:108 ) ) = 1 , if ( cid:108 ) and ( cid:108 ) are in the same category under the cluster level ( cid:79)(cid:121 ) , and ( cid:87 ) ( (cid:108 ) , ( cid:108 ) ) = 0 , otherwise . In this paper , the cluster level ( cid:79)(cid:121 ) is defined as the level where the number of categories is equal to the number of clusters .
3 Design of Algorithm AT ( Association Tax onomy )
In this paper , we devise algorithm AT for clustering item data . The similarity measurement of AT will be described in Section 31 Section 3.2 describes the procedure of AT .
3.1 Similarity Measurement
The similarity measurement employed by algorithm AT is called association taxonomy similarity which consists of the association similarity and the taxonomy similarity . As described before , the set of association itemsets is denoted by ( cid:79 ) = {(cid:76)1 , ( cid:76)2 , , ( cid:76)} . For each association itemset , the association relationships of items can be represented as a complete graph ( cid:76 ) = { ( cid:72)} , consisting of a set of vertices and a set of edges ( cid:72 ) . In each complete graph , each vertex represents an item in the association itemset and each edge represents the association between two items . In mining association rules , an association rule ( cid:108 ) ( cid:36 ) ( cid:108 ) holds in transaction database ( cid:71 ) with confidence ( (cid:108 ) ( cid:36 ) ( cid:108 ) ) if ( (cid:108 ) ( cid:36 ) ( cid:108 ) ) of transactions in D that contain ( cid:108 ) also contain ( cid:108 ) . In this paper , we use co confidence as the measurement of the association between two items . Here the co confidence between ( cid:108 ) and ( cid:108 ) is defined as :
( (cid:108 ) ( cid:108 ) ) =
=
1 2 1 2
( ((cid:108 ) ( cid:36 ) ( cid:108 ) ) + ( (cid:108 ) ( cid:36 ) ( cid:108) ) ) ( ( cid:86)(cid:120)((cid:108)(cid:108 ) ) ( cid:86)(cid:120)((cid:108 ) )
+ ( cid:86)(cid:120)((cid:108)(cid:108 ) ) ( cid:86)(cid:120)((cid:108 ) )
) where ( cid:86)(cid:120)((cid:108 ) ) is the support of item ( cid:108 ) . The co confidence ( (cid:108 ) , ( cid:108 ) ) represents the association between item ( cid:108 ) and item ( cid:108 ) .
Each association itemset is viewed as a cluster of items ( ie , = ( cid:76) ) . For notational simplicity , the union cluster of and is denoted as . The set of overlapped items in is denoted as and the set of nonoverlapped items in is denoted as . In addition , ( cid:72 ) denotes the set of edges in , ( cid:72 ) denotes the set of edges connecting the overlapped items in , ( cid:72 ) de notes the set of edges connecting the overlapped items and non overlapped items in , and ( cid:72 ) denotes the set of a set of items {(cid:108)1 , ( cid:108)2 , , ( cid:108)} . In mining association rules [ 1 ] , the minimum support ( cid:86)(cid:120 ) is given to identify the large itemsets . In addition , the support of an itemset in database ( cid:71 ) is defined as the number of transactions which contain this itemset in database ( cid:71 ) . An itemset is called a large itemset if its support is larger than or equal to the minimum support ( cid:86)(cid:120 ) . In this paper , an association itemset is defined as a large itemset that contains at least two items and is not contained by any other large itemset . The set of association itemsets is denoted by ( cid:79 ) = {(cid:76)1 , ( cid:76)2 , , ( cid:76)} . Items in the transactions can be generalized to multiple concept levels of the taxonomy and represented as a taxonomy tree . In the taxonomy tree , the leaf nodes are called the item nodes and the internal nodes are called the category nodes .
In view of the features of item data , the items are categorized into three kinds of items which are association items ( represented as ( cid:76) ) , single large items ( represented as ( cid:76)(cid:86) ) , and rare items ( represented as ( cid:76)(cid:85) ) . An association item is an item which appears in at least one association itemset . A single large item is a large item but not an association item . In essence , a single large item can be viewed as a large 1item which is not contained by any large 2 itemset . A rare item is not a large item ( ie , not frequently purchased ) . Explicitly , the rare item is an item whose support is smaller than the minimum support .
In this paper , a clustering =(cid:63 ) 1 , 2 , , ( cid:65 ) is a partition of items into clusters , where ( cid:109 ) is a cluster consisting of a set of items . Note that purchasing relationships ( ie , association ) and taxonomy relationships are important for the shelf space organization . In this paper , the objective of clustering item data is to cluster the items with high association relationships and high taxonomy relationships together .
In view of the features of item data , we propose association index and taxonomy index , which are defined below , to assess the qualities of the clustering results .
Definition 1 : ( Association Index ) The association index of the clustering is defined as :
X
X

| |
( cid:76)( ) = where ( (cid:108 ) ( cid:108 ) ) is the association value of item ( cid:108 ) and item ( cid:108 ) . Explicitly , ( (cid:108 ) ( cid:108 ) ) = 1 , if ( cid:108 ) and ( cid:108 ) are in the same association itemset based on the minimum support ( cid:86)(cid:120 ) , and ( (cid:108 ) , ( cid:108 ) ) = 0 , otherwise .
Definition 2 : ( Taxonomy Index ) The taxonomy index of the clustering is defined as :
Proceedings of the Third IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM’03 ) 0 7695 1978 4/03 $ 17.00 © 2003 IEEE edges connecting the non overlapped items in . Similarly , the association similarity between overlapped items of and is defined as :
X
( (cid:108 ) , ( cid:108 ) )
( cid:108 )
( cid:108 )
|(cid:72 )
| + |(cid:72 )
|
( cid:86)( , ) = where ( (cid:108 ) , ) is the set of items which is in the same category with item ( cid:108 ) in level in . As a result , the taxonomy similarity of non overlapped items of and is defined as :
X
X
( cid:61 )
( cid:87 ) ( cid:86)( , ) =
( cid:108 )
( cid:87)((cid:108 ) , ) +
( cid:108 ) | || + |
|
( cid:87)((cid:108 ) , ) | ||
( cid:61 )
Moreover , the association similarity between overlapped items and non overlapped items of and is defined as :
X
( cid:86)( , ) =
( (cid:108 ) , ( cid:108 ) )
( cid:108 )
( cid:108 )
|(cid:72 )
| + |(cid:72 )
|
( cid:61 )
| is a normalization factor for considering Note that |(cid:72 ) the effect of the edges of non overlapped items in decreasing the similarity between two clusters . Explicitly , the existence of non overlapped items represents the dissimilarity between two clusters . Thus , an edge between the nonoverlapped items increases the association dissimilarity between two clusters .
Definition 3 : ( Association Similarity ) The association similarity between and is defined as : ( cid:86)( , ) = ffi(cid:86)( , )+ffi(cid:86)( , ) where ffi is the weight of the association similarity between overlapped items and ffi is the weight of the association similarity between overlapped items and nonoverlapped items .
In view of the factor of the taxonomy similarity , the similarity for different properties are thus conducted . The taxonomy similarity of overlapped item ( cid:108 ) to union cluster is defined as :
( cid:87)((cid:108 ) , ) =
( cid:79)(cid:121)X
|((cid:108 ) , )|
=1 where ( cid:79)(cid:121 ) is the number of levels in the taxonomy tree and ( (cid:108 ) , ) is the set of items which is in the same category with item ( cid:108 ) in level in . Similarly , the taxonomy similarity of overlapped items of and is defined as :
X
( cid:87)((cid:108 ) , ) | ( || fi 1 ) ( cid:61 )
( cid:108 ) |
( cid:87 ) ( cid:86)( , ) =
Moreover , let ( cid:108 ) be an item in and ( cid:108 ) is not overlapped with any item in . The taxonomy similarity of nonoverlapped item ( cid:108 ) in cluster to cluster is defined as :
( cid:87)((cid:108 ) , ) =
( cid:79)(cid:121)X
|((cid:108 ) , )|
=1

Definition 4 : ( Taxonomy Similarity ) The taxonomy similarity between and is defined as : ( cid:87 ) ( cid:86)( , ) = ffl(cid:87 ) ( cid:86)( , )+ffl((cid:87 ) ( cid:86)( , )fi 1 ( cid:79)(cid:121 )
) where ffl is the weight of the taxonomy similarity of overlapped items and ffl is the weight of the taxonomy similarity of non overlapped items . If each item in and each item in only have the root node as the same category , is totally dissimilar to according to the taxonomy tree and ( cid:87 ) ( cid:86)( , ) should be zero . Hence , because there are no overlapped item between and , the constant ( cid:79)(cid:121 ) is subtracted in the non overlapped part for normalization purpose .

Definition 5 : ( Association Taxonomy Similarity ) The association taxonomy similarity between and is denoted as ( cid:86)(cid:76 ) ( , ) defined as : ( cid:86)(cid:76 ) ( , ) = ( cid:86)( , ) + ( cid:87 ) ( cid:87 ) ( cid:86)( , ) where is the weight of the association similarity and ( cid:87 ) is the weight of the taxonomy similarity . The determination of values of and ( cid:87 ) is in fact applicationdependent .
3.2 Procedure of Algorithm AT
Algorithm AT is designed to consist of three phases : the segmentation phase , the association taxonomy phase , and the pure taxonomy phase . Note that the association items consist of the elements in association itemsets . The overall procedure of algorithm AT is outlined as follows . Procedure of Algorithm AT ( Association Taxonomy ) ( 1 ) The Segmentation Phase : Step 1 . Identify the set of association itemsets , the set of single large items , and the set of rare items . ( 2 ) The Association Taxonomy Phase : Step 2 . For each pair in the set of the association itemsets , calculate the corresponding association taxonomy similarity . Step 3 . Merge the pair which has the largest associationtaxonomy similarity as a new cluster . Step 4 . Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 until the dendrogram is constructed . ( 3 ) The Pure Taxonomy Phase :

Step 5 . Identify clusters in the dendrogram . Step 6 . For each single large item , allocate it to the cluster with the largest taxonomy similarity . Step 7 . For each rare item , allocate it to the cluster with the largest taxonomy similarity . Step 8 . Repeat Step 6 and Step 7 until no item is moved between clusters .
The advantageous features of algorithm AT are twofold . The first one is on employing the association taxonomy similarity to effectively improve the quality of clustering association items . The second one is to allocate the single large items and rare items into clusters by calculating the taxonomy similarity . As such , these items can be efficiently and effectively allocated into the clusters . Note that the numbers of single large items and rare items are usually large as compared to the number of association itemsets . If we take each single large item ( or each rare item ) as a cluster and put them into the procedure from Step 2 to Step 4 , the execution time will be prohibitive . In addition , lack of large association similarity with other clusters , these clusters with only one single large item ( or one rare item ) would never be merged until most of the association itemsets are merged . These problems are avoided in algorithm AT .
4 Experimental Studies
To assess the efficiency of AT , we conducted experiments to compare AT with the k modes algorithm [ 3 ] and the ROCK algorithm [ 2 ] . For the lack of space , we merely use the real market basket data from a large bookstore company for performance study and the analytical comparison from synthetic data will be conducted in our future extesion . In this real data set , there are |(cid:71)| = 100(cid:78 ) transactions , |(cid:76)| = 58909 items , and ( cid:79)(cid:121 ) = 3 levels . In addition , the number of the taxonomy level in this real data set is 3 . In the real data , the items with the same category are usually purchased together . Thus , the association relationships and taxonomy relationships are related to each other .
Figure 2 shows the relative quality of clustering results of AT , ROCK , and k modes in real data set where the database size |(cid:71)| varies from 20K to 100K . When we vary |(cid:71)| from 20K to 100K in ROCK , the numbers of clusters are , respectively , 576 , 524 , 468 , 413 , and 519 . With associationtaxonomy similarity measurement , AT significantly outperforms other algorithms as validated by ( cid:76)( ) in Figure 2(a ) and by ( cid:87 ) ( cid:76)( ) in Figure 2(b ) . In this real data set , because the items with high taxonomy relationships are usually purchased together while the items with low taxonomy relationships are not , AT has higher taxonomy index than association index , ie , ( cid:76)( ) ( cid:65 ) ( cid:76)( ) .
5 Conclusion
In this paper , with the association taxonomy similarity measurement proposed , we developed algorithm AT for item data . Two validation indexes based on association and
