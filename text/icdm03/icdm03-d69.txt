Abstract
The success of prediction models for business purposes should not be measured by their accuracy only . Their evaluation should also take into account the higher importance of precise prediction for “ valuable ” customers . We illustrate this idea through the example of churn modeling in telecommunications , where it is obviously much more important to identify potential churn among valuable customers . We discuss , both theoretically and empirically , the optimal use of “ customer value ” data in the model training , model evaluation and scoring stages . Our main conclusion is that a non trivial approach of using “ decayed ” valueweights for training is usually preferable to the two obvious approaches of either using non decayed customer values as weights or ignoring them .
1 . Introduction
Successful analysis and modeling of data can contribute greatly to the success of businesses . A key ingredient in fulfilling this promise is to integrate an understanding of the true goals , processes and criteria for success of the business into the data analysis process . In previous papers we have tackled the problems of correct consideration of business goals in model evaluation [ 11 ] and of calculating and utilizing customer lifetime value [ 12 ] . In this paper we present another key issue in successful modeling for business purposes : consideration and inclusion of customer value information in all phases of the data analysis process : insight discovery , predictive modeling , model evaluation and scoring . As a concrete example , consider the problem of churn analysis in wireless telephony . The prediction task is clearly a binary one , namely to predict whether or not a customer will disconnect and switch to a competitor . However the loss incurred by incorrect prediction depends on the individual customer value : wrongly predicting the behavior of a low value customer should not worry the telecommunication company at all , while making a mistake on a premium customer can lead to grave consequences . Calculating a customer ’s current value is usually a straight forward calculation based on the customer ’s current or information : usage , price plan , payments , collection efforts , call center contacts , etc . An recent example for the customer value can be ‘The financial value of a customer to the organization’ . This value can be calculated from ‘received payments’ minus the ‘cost of supplying products and services’ to the customer .
Let us assume , therefore , that we know how to calculate customer value from available data . In this case , although the customer value is a known quantity , it still plays an important role in evaluating the performance of prediction models for unknown quantities such as a churn indicator . The key statistical question is what is the correct use of these customer values in the modeling stage , to create models that are most useful for the “ weighted ” loss . We tackle this problem theoretically in section 3 and experimentally in section 6 . We consider the two naive extreme approaches : 1 .
Ignore customer values in the modeling stage ie treat the problem as a “ standard ” modeling problem the
2 . Optimize customer value weighted loss on training data We show that these are both generally sub optimal and that an intermediate approach of using decayed customer value weights for training is usually preferable to both .
Additional stages in the modeling and scoring process results where customer values should be considered are :
Presenting knowledge discovery ( eg patterns ) to a user . We advocate presenting both the customer value weighted and non weighted results to complement each other . An example can be seen in section 5 .
Model evaluation . Model evaluation on unseen ( “ test ” ) data should clearly take into account the specific way in which “ future ” loss is defined . Thus it should use the customer values to weigh the loss in the same way as the business would . See section 4 .
Scoring for prediction . This is the “ deployment ” stage of the model . The way in which the scoring process should use the customer values depends on the way in which the resulting scores are to be used . For example , if the scores are going to be used for choosing a segment to run a retention campaign on , then the individual customer churn scores should be multiplied by customer values and then sorted to find the optimal campaign population . In section 6 we give a detailed example of the use of customer value in the various data analysis stages within the Amdocs CRM Analytics module . It illustrates the is importance and usefulness of correctly using customer value . Our formulation of the learning problem can be interpreted as a cost sensitive learning task where the costs differ by instance rather than by class . [ 14 ] mentions it as one of the under researched types of cost sensitive learning . Several authors have presented and discussed similar problems in this context . For example , [ 8 ] attribute costs to fraud cases in telecommunication , while [ 2 ] considers donation amounts as “ customer values ” in a donation solicitation direct marketing campaign . Our discussion adds to previous work in two main points : Rather than concentrating on the specific stages , we track the use of customer value throughout the knowledge discovery process in a churn analysis system . In the modeling stage , we present our novel approach of using “ decayed ” customer values as weights in model training . This approach theoretically and empirically .
2 . The role of customer value justified both
When building prediction models , we usually have in mind a “ loss function ” which describes the measure of accuracy we are going to apply to our prediction model . In the churn analysis example this loss function may consider the cost of losing a customer because the model did not classify him/her as a “ churner ” ( ie a “ false negative ” ) ; and the cost of making a needless retention effort on a “ loyal ” customer because the model classified her/him as a “ churner ” ( ie a “ false positive ” ) . Denote the former cost by c1 and the latter cost by c2 . A naive modeling effort would target finding a model , which minimizes the loss when applied to future , unseen data , ie minimize P over the population distribution . A more sophisticated view would consider customer value as a relevant quantity loss . In particular , a reasonable modeling goal would be to minimize expected customer value weighted loss , ie look for a model , which minimizes : IVE ( [{ where V is a random variable describing the customer ’s value , and I is the indicator function . in determining negative ) false false negative ) positive ) false false positive )

More generally , we could consider having a “ nonweighted ” loss function L , which depends on the observed responses and the predicted ones , where our real goal would be to minimize the customer value weighted expected loss , ie we want to find a model f(x ) that minimizes E [ V L(Y , f(X) ) ]

3 . The use of customer values in modeling
We now concentrate on investigating the correct use of customer values ( or more generally observation importance weights ) when building prediction models , from a theoretical perspective . The general framework is : We have data ( xi , yi)i=1n and we also have observation value information ( vi)i=1n . These data come from a joint distribution on ( X,Y,V ) . Our goal is to build a model , which minimizes some expected loss L , weighted by observation value , ie we want our model f to minimize EXYV V L ( Y , f(X) ) . specifically , we
The main question we want to answer , is how should we use the training observation values vi in order to build “ good ” models . More consider minimizing a weighted loss function on our training data of the following form : n xfyLv∑ ( ( 2 ) i 1 = Taking p=1 amounts to weighting the empirical loss by the customer values , while taking p=0 means we are ignoring the values completely in building our model . We could certainly consider other families of transformations for the power transformation used here , but for clarity and brevity we limit this discussion to this family only . As candidates for f we will consider the family of linear models in our predictors f(x ) = β’x . Our results will have broader implications than for what is usually called “ linear models ” only , since many “ non linear ” modeling techniques can be described as linear models in some alternative predictor space : kernel support vector machines [ 4 ] , boosting [ 13 ] and logistic regression are a few examples . the customer values , other
We will start by analyzing linear regression , ie the loss is squared error loss . For that case we can derive rigorous results about the effects of weighting on the prediction error of our model . The results and insights we gain from this analysis will serve us as intuition for understanding and interpreting the experimental results we get for less “ mathematically friendly ” situations .

Note that although this estimator is the same as the standard “ weighted least squares ” estimator ( eg [ 15] ) , the underlying statistical theory is different , as in our case increased weight does not correspond to decreased variance . This affects our results in theorems 1 and 2 below , which do not hold for weighted least squares .
Let us now add a couple of additional assumptions for the purpose of our statistical analysis : 1 . Our true model is of the form Y = f(x ) + ε , where f(x)=E(Y|x ) is the best “ oracle ” prediction at this x , and ε has mean 0 and variance σ2 .
2 . We are interested only in the predictions at the given “ training ” set of xi and vi values . In other words , the only randomness we are considering is in the distribution of the response . This is an extension of the “ fixed x ” assumption usually made to facilitate easier analysis of linear models . This extension is somewhat problematic as the stochasticity of the customer value plays an important role in our discussion . However the insights we gain from our results will remain valid even when we allow random customer values ( see discussion below ) . The key to our analysis will be the decomposition of the expected squared error loss into three components : irreducible error , squared bias and variance . For a derivation of this decomposition , see for example [ 4 ] . In our case , we apply this decomposition to the weighted squared error loss in the “ fixed x and v ” case to get ( denote by the prediction xtp )

The first term is the “ irreducible ” error , which an ideal prediction would incur because of the inherent variability in the response . The second term is the value weighted squared bias , sometimes referred to as approximation error . The third term is the variance of the prediction , or estimation error , since : )(ˆ( xfE The main idea behind this decomposition is that the two “ reducible ” additive components usually trade off as a function of model complexity . Making the model more complex ( for example , adding dimensions to the x predictor vector ) decreases the bias by giving our model more flexibility to represent the “ real ” function f , but increases the variance since we are estimating a more complex model .

In our current context it turns out that the “ decay ” parameter p also serves to trade off bias and variance . Setting p=1 , ie using the non decayed customer values in training , minimizes the value weighted bias . Setting p=0 and ignoring the customer values in training , minimizes the variance . These two concepts are captured in the following theorems , whose proofs can be found in [ 9 ] . Theorem 1 : The variance of the fit is minimized when p=0 : ∀ This theorem shows that the variance term in ( 3 ) is uniformly minimized by ignoring the customer values completely . In other words , ignoring the values makes “ most efficient ” use of the training sample to estimate the coefficient vector β . Theorem 2 : The average value weighted squared bias is minimized when p=1 : ( x i This theorem shows that the bias term in ( 3 ) is minimized by using the non decayed customer values . In other words , using the values makes “ most representative ” use of the training sample to estimate the coefficient vector β . Combining theorems 1 and 2 gives us some intuition about the bias variance tradeoff involved in customervalue weighted analysis . We see that the variance is uniformly minimized when we take p=0 , while the xfv ( i i xfv ( i i

) if average value weighted bias is minimized when we take p=1 . The optimal power p* will thus be determined by the balance between these two effects . In general , if the reducible error is dominated by variance ( in particular if the model is unbiased ) , we can expect to get p*≅ 0 , while if the bias effect is much bigger ( in particular if we have a large training sample and not many parameters ) then we can expect to get p*≅1 .
It is important to note , though , that the bias results were based on the notion that the values remain the same on the ``future'' copy of the data . This assumption strongly biases our results towards favoring value weighting . For example , imagine that in reality the customer values of unseen customers are all iid from some V distribution , independent of the values of ( X,Y ) . In that case , theorem 2 is completely irrelevant ( since we cannot infer any useful information from the training customer value ) and we can easily show that we can do no better than the solution with p=0 in terms of value weighted prediction error . However , the unseen customer values are correlated with the training set values ( as would generally be the case in real life data ) , theorem 2 still has merit as an indicator that use of the training set values is likely to decrease future value weighted bias .
32 Interpretation and discussion
If our loss is not squared error loss , in particular if the prediction task at hand is a classification task , then the terms “ bias ” and “ variance ” don’t have a clear mathematical definition . However the conceptual ideas of “ approximation error ” and “ estimation error ” still describe the sources of error in our model . Approximation error tells us how good of a model our method could build if it had infinite data , while “ estimation error ” indicates how far from this best model are we can expect to be in our finite sample case . And it stands to reason that the trade off we observed in the squared error loss case would still be in effect :
Using customer values as observation weights in the modeling stage improves “ approximation ” because it gives us a more reliable description of what our “ future ” loss looks like . Ignoring customer values in the modeling stage improves “ estimation ” because it gives us more “ effective ” observations to estimate the model with . This intuition is confirmed empirically in [ 9 ] , as well as in experiments we made with logistic regression presented in section 6 .

Thus , the observation importance weights still need to be accounted for explicitly in the evaluation stage . to overcome intuitive way
In many cases the situation is not as straight forward as the formulation we have described so far . In particular , the “ true ” loss may not have the form ( 1 ) , and may not even be clearly defined when we build the model . This takes us back to the issue of correct “ business oriented ” evaluation of prediction models , with the added complication that we also need to take customer value into account . The this complication is to use the same evaluation measure one would choose for the problem if all customer values were equal , and then modify it to take customer values into account and perform “ value weighted ” evaluation . For example , consider using evaluation measures related to the lift or the ROC curve ( see [ 11 ] for definition of the methods and discussion of their equivalence and [ 7 ] for a discussion of the desirable properties of the ROC ) . These measures require calculating scores for all test set observations , sorting them and calculating ratios of coverage of “ responders ” and “ non responders ” at a predetermined cutoff point . If we want to calculate these measures with regard to a customer value weighted objective , we should re calibrate the “ scores ” by multiplying them by individual customer values . In the example of churn analysis , the value lift at percentile x would then correspond to : percentage of churn customer value in the top x % of sorted list / percentage of total customer value in the top x % of the sorted list .
We discuss this model evaluation approach in more detail in section 5.3 , and give an illustrated example in section 6 . In the model deployment ( or scoring ) stage , when the model we have built is actually used for supporting and guiding business or marketing decisions , we should similarly consider customer value in any scoring process . In particular , customer propensity scores should be multiplied by customer value to give “ expected value loss ” scores . Such value weighted scores should also guide selection of campaign populations .

Segmentation and Analysis session the business problems of Amdocs’ customers in the telecommunication industry . Among the solutions are Churn and retention analysis , Fraud detection [ 5 ] , [ 10 ] , Lifetime Value modeling [ 12 ] , Bad Debt analysis , Product analysis and more . For the purpose of churn management and analysis , we use the CRM Analytics module , which allows the users to perform all stages of the churn management process within one system . Customer value considerations come into play in many different stages of its workflow : Rule Discovery Modeling Model Evaluation
Scoring We will now describe the main system components and the way in which customer value features in each one of them . The Knowledge Discovery process starts with data collection , cleaning , pre processing and transforming to get a “ flat file ” which is the input to the analysis process . In our context we need to make sure that customer value variables are included in the input data , in particular that a “ customer value ” calculated field has been added to the flat file . Analytics offers a flexible value calculation interface , based on the information in the customer data mart .
51 Rule discovery , segmentation and analysis
The first analytic step in Analytics is rule discovery . The algorithms used are decision tree and rule induction . Its output is a collection of rules ( aka patterns ) describing customer segments with strong tendency towards churn or loyalty . These rules are presented to the analyst , who can view and interpret them , modify them and add new rules that represent business knowledge not captured by the automated discovery . Figure 1 gives an example of a rule as viewed in the application . It contains the conditions defining the segment – in this case : at least 2 call center contacts and specific handsets ( which are old and unsophisticated ) . It also displays various graphic and numeric illustrations of its statistics . For example , the “ coverage ” field tells us what population size this segment covers it covers 252 customers in the sample , which are 8.4 % of the total customer sample . The expected hit denotes the estimated churn probability , which is 722 % All of these statistics ignore customer value , ie are based on counting customers regardless of their value .
However to give the analyst a reliable picture of the monetary impact of this segment ’s churn behavior it seems interesting to give a view of the segment ’s statistics calculated “ by value ” rather than “ by number ” . Figure 2 shows the same segment as figure 1 but using the “ by value ” view instead of the “ by number ” view . Consider the “ coverage ” field in figure 2 . It tells us that the combined “ customer value ” of all customers in this segment is 215,499.53 , which is actually 5.7 % of the total customer value in our customer sample . We see that this segment covers 8.4 % of the customer population but only 5.7 % of the total customer value . Also of interest is the difference in the “ accuracy ” field between the two panels . It tells us that 72.2 % of the customers in this segment are churners , but that these represent 62.5 % of the total customer value for all customers in the segment . To summarize our conclusions about this segment of customers that have unsophisticated handsets and have contacted the call center at least twice in the past month from this dual view : Their average customer value is 50 % less than that of the general population than
Within this segment , the non churn customers tend to have higher customer value the churners ( incidentally , that difference is about 50 % as well – an easy calculation based on the numbers given above ) . This example illustrates the merit in combining a standard customer based view and customer value based view , which together allow us to understand the churn behavior of our customers and how it relates to revenue movement . The final output of the analysis stage is a set of useful and accurate segments that are used as inputs to the actual model building stage .
52 Model building
The main modeling tool in Analytics is logistic regression , which takes as input both the original variables and binary “ features ” representing the rules generated in the analysis stage . As we discussed in section 3 , the main statistical focus of this paper is how to correctly transform the customer values into observation weights in the model training stage .
To understand how logistic regression can be modified to take observation weights , consider the
( 4 ) generic formulation ( 2 ) . Since logistic regression seeks to maximize the binomial log likelihood of the data , we can formulate is as a “ loss minimization ” problem using minus binomial log likelihood as our loss . The weighted criterion analogy to ( 2 ) for logistic regression would thus be to minimize : n ∑ )ˆ p log( i

1( −+ yw [ i log(
) ] y

1 = vw p = i i
ˆ , p i

ˆ( 1 ( β− tp ) x i
)
, and β is the where vector of coefficients which we aim to estimate . Not surprisingly , this formulation is equivalent to having wi identical copies of observation i in our training data , which also gives us an idea how we could estimate β using methods that are essentially identical to those used for non weighted data ( see [ 6 ] for a discussion of these methods ) . It should be emphasized that the output of logistic regression with this “ weighted ” criterion is still a model , which assigns a churn probability to each customer . All we have changed is the way in which these probabilities are estimated . tends , in general ,
The logistic regression component in Analytics uses the weighting rule w = v½ for building prediction models . This “ rule of thumb ” is a result of extensive experiments on various data sets and represents a “ bias variance ” compromise , which to perform reasonably . An alternative approach could have been to make the power p a user selected tuning parameter , which is problematic due to the difficulty in interpreting this parameter . Another alternative would be to add p as another parameter to the model optimization process , which is difficult computationally and presents additional technical difficulties .
53 Model evaluation and scoring
The typical use of a churn prediction model is not for classification but rather for two quite different tasks :
Selection of populations for pro active retention campaigns . This entails selecting a small part of the total population ( typically a few percents ) to make a concerted retention effort on . The selection criterion can be by population segment or it may just ask for a list of customers who represent the most “ value at risk ” on whom the retention effort is most warranted ( we will concentrate on the second option ) .
Maintenance of an individual “ churn propensity ” score for all customers , but the important and valuable customers . These scores may or may not correspond to actual probabilities ( in many cases they are just in the form of qualitative “ levels ” of risk ) , although getting good probability estimates is certainly advantageous in any case . in particular
For the first task a “ lift at x % ” measure would be appropriate if the desired cutoff point is known in advance , otherwise a global lift measure like “ area under lift curve ” may be warranted . For the second task , it seems like a likelihood measure may actually be the most appropriate one , although misclassification rate and the total area under the lift curve may be a reasonable surrogates . Model evaluation in Analytics uses the lift measure , displaying numerically the model ’s lift at a large number of cutoff points , displaying the resulting lift curve and the curve . Customer value considerations are integrated into the evaluation as described in section 4 . The test set scores are calculated as a product of propensity to churn given by the model and the ( known ) customer values : Scorei = vi * pi ( 5 ) They are then sorted in descending order and the “ valuelift ” at x % is calculated as : ∑ the area under

Where Ix is the set of test set observations whose scores are in the top x % of scores The model evaluation component in Analytics allows both standard lift evaluation of the model and value lift evaluation . As we observed in the analysis stage , the different views can give distinctly different results in this stage too .
Figure 3 shows a pair of lift curves , for the same model on the same test data . One is a regular lift curve and the other is a value lift curve . The two curves are very different and represent the essential difference in the two evaluation methods . See also the case study in section 6 .
Figure 3 . Regular lift ( on bottom ) and value lift ( on top )
A similar two views approach is taken by the application in the scoring component , which is used for prediction once the model is deployed . Customer churn propensities are estimated using the model and “ value propensity ” scores are calculated from them as in ( 5 ) ( recall that the customer value is a function of the predictors and is therefore known even for real prediction tasks ) . The business user can ask for the propensity scores , the value propensity scores or both , and can utilize either one in selecting populations for retention campaigns or other campaigns .
6 . Case study
We now describe a case study of churn analysis performed with customer value considerations on real data , using the Amdocs CRM Analytics . The data source is a telecommunication service provider and the data consists of around 400 predictors . The data was split to a training sample set containing 1500 churn observations and 1500 loyal observations and to a test sample set containing 750 churn observations and 750 loyal observations . The customer value formula was defined in Analytics , using several fields available in the data .
The first stage was to perform knowledge discovery by running the rule discovery mechanism described in section 51 Figure 1 ( in that section ) displays one of the rules automatically discovered by the application . The total number of rules discovered was 21 . The next stage was to construct logistic regression models using a combination of binary variables representing these 21 rules and 50 of the original variables as predictors .
Following our approach of using decayed customer values as observation weights for modeling , we proceeded to build several weighted logistic regression models for this data The value transformations we used were : 1 . Non decayed weights : using the training customer values vi as weights for the logistic regression
2 . Square root decay : using vi
0.5 as weights for the logistic regression training . This is the default approach of Analytics , as discussed in section 5.2
0.25 as
3 . Strong decay : using the quadruple roots vi
4 . weights for logistic regression training . Ignoring customer values completely in the modeling stage ( ie each observation has “ weight ” 1 ) . The same training data set , as described above , was used for building all models . The models were evaluated on the leave out test sample from the same population . The evaluation measure used was the lift , and we calculated its value at a range of cutoff points . We calculated both the value lift as described in section 5.3 and the standard , non value weighted lift . Table 1 and figure 4 show the results for the value lift evaluation and table 2 and figure 5 show the results for the standard lift evaluation .

Figure 4 . Value lift results
We observe that for the value lift calculations , the model using non decayed values is best for very low cutoff points , but for the vast majority of cutoff points considered , the two decayed models ( models 2,3 above ) seem to do significantly better than the two extreme models . In the two tables we can also see 95 % confidence intervals for the various value lift values at the various cutoff points , calculated using the hyper geometric approximation described in [ 11 ] . We see that the decayed models seem to do significantly better than the two extreme ones in many cutoff points . For the standard lift calculations our results in section 3 would lead us to expect the non weighted model ( model 4 ) to be the best modeling approach . The actual differences we observe in table 2 and figure 5 are less striking than those for the value weighted evaluation . We observe that the strongly decayed model and the non weighted model ( models 3,4 ) generally perform best , although the differences for much of the range are not very big . The non decayed model 1 , which is supposed to be least appropriate for this evaluation , does give significantly worse lift than models 3,4 for the higher cutoff points considered , as we can observe in table 2 .

Figure 5 . Standard lift results lift results by observing
We can emphasize the difference between the valuethese lift and standard comparison points : 1 . The model built using non weighted data ( model 4 ) is not better than either of the two decayed models for practically every cutoff point considered in the value lift evaluation ( Table 1 ) . For the standard lift evaluation model 4 is at the very least competitive , sometimes better than both model 2 and model 3 .
2 . Comparing model 1 and model 4 ’s performance for the two evaluations show us that on the value lift evaluation they behave quite similarly and tend to do worse that the decayed models . However on the standard lift evaluation , model 1 is clearly much less appropriate than model 4 . This is what we would expect theoretically , and this is what we observe in practice . Looking at our results , it seems a bigger test set may have been useful in better differentiating the various models . While the differences in their performance may be a few percents only , consider that these models are to be deployed on customer databases containing millions of customers , among them tens of thousands of churners each month . Simple ROI calculations show that a difference of 3 % in value lift can easily correspond to

$50k difference monthly in the profitability of retention campaigns , considering both the effect of missing valuable churners and wasting retention efforts on nonvaluable ones or on customers who do not intend to churn .
We feel that this case study confirms the main points of our exposition : 1 . Decay of training customer values is beneficial for value weighted prediction
2 . Value weighted presentation and evaluation of results is important for building better prediction models for business purposes
7 . Summary
In this paper we have tackled the practical use of customer values throughout the data analysis process , in particular for churn analysis in telecommunications . We have illustrated that in the modeling stage it is beneficial to choose a transformation of the training data customer values as weights for learning , and discussed the correct use of customer values in evaluation , scoring and insight discovery . We have shown how these concepts are applied in practice in the Amdocs CRM Analytics and illustrated their performance on real life churn data . There are many additional interesting and relevant questions that come up when considering data with observation importance weights , such as : What
( or algorithms ) for building value weighted prediction models ? are good modeling approaches
How can we adjust “ standard ” modeling tools to take value into consideration ( this problem has been widely addressed in the machine learning literature ) What can we do when customer values are not certain but we have approximate values ? What can we do when they are known only “ in the future ” ?
