ABSTRACT “ Inside information ” comes in many forms : knowledge of a corporate takeover , a terrorist attack , unexpectedly poor earnings , the FDA ’s acceptance of a new drug , etc . Anyone who knows some piece of soon to break news possesses inside information . Historically , insider trading has been detected after the news is public , but this is often too late : fraud has been perpetrated , innocent investors have been disadvantaged , or terrorist acts have been carried out . This paper explores early detection of insider trading – detection before the news breaks . Data mining holds great promise for this emerging application , but the problem also poses significant challenges . We present the specific problem of insider trading in option markets , compare decision tree , logistic regression , and neural net results to results from an expert model , and discuss insights that knowledge discovery techniques shed upon this problem .

1 . INTRODUCTION Financial markets allow people to profit from knowledge they have without giving that knowledge away or even letting others know they have it . This fact makes financial markets tempting vehicles for illicitly profiting from “ inside information ” – information that affects a company ’s value but is not yet available to the public . Examples of inside information include advance knowledge of : ( cid:131 ) A company being up/downgraded in a research report .
( cid:131 ) Unexpectedly good or poor earnings ( cid:131 ) Revisions to earnings projections ( cid:131 ) Settlement of a lawsuit ( cid:131 ) FDA accepting or rejecting a new drug ( cid:131 ) SEC announcing an investigation of a company ’s accounting practices
( cid:131 ) USDA announcing first US case of Mad Cow disease ( cid:131 ) Terrorist attacks affecting a specific industry/company ( cid:131 ) Mergers and acquisitions
A person doesn’t have to be a corporate executive to have inside information . Family members , in laws , and friends often hear corporate secrets . Psychologists have heard of pending mergers from their patients . Janitors have taken sensitive material from trash cans . Lawyers have overheard important news from colleagues . Terrorists have had advance knowledge of attacks . When people trade on inside information , they leave faint traces of this in trading data . Trading volumes are often unusually high . Price movements are unusual . Trading in options is unusually distributed among various contract types . This is especially true in “ thinly traded ” securities ( ones that usually have low trading volumes ) because a small amount of insider trading has a larger impact on the overall trading . This is as opposed to heavily traded stocks where signals of insider trading are likely to be drowned out by the noise of normal trading . Our work focuses on option trading because options are thinly traded compared to stocks . Most systems that find insider trading look for it after the news is public . The news is the “ trigger ” that begins the search for unusual trading that preceded the news . The SONAR system at NASD [ 3 ] is an excellent example of such a system . This approach works very well for most regulatory purposes where the goal is to prosecute those who have committed insider trading . For other goals such as preventing terrorist attacks or preventing being taken advantage of by a trader with inside information , a method is needed that detects problems before the news breaks . This paper explores early detection of insider trading – detection before the news breaks . There are several uses of a system that could provide leads of where insider trading is occurring . Such leads could be used in conjunction with other intelligence to give an early warning of planned terrorist attacks . Brokerage firms could take steps to protect themselves against a sudden swing in a security ’s price . Corporations could know if sensitive information is being leaked and avoid brand name tarnishing that is associated with insider trading . Even if the exact timing or nature of news cannot be known with high certainty , leads can keep people from being caught totally off guard . Data mining technology is a good fit for this problem because it is able to automatically pick up faint signals from noisy data . It is able to discover correlations that experts may not have been aware of . Data mining has also proven useful at finding trends in human behavior , and markets are the synthesis of the behaviors of many individuals ( some with inside information , most without ) . Although early detection has several important uses , and data mining is a good fit for the problem , there are several challenges to solving the problem :
( cid:131 ) The important information about insider trading is very spread out . Between 20 and 120 different types of option contracts trade on any given day for every underlying company , and the relevant information is spread over these . The important information is also often spread across multiple trading days .
( cid:131 ) In addition to structured trading data , much important information is also buried in unstructured text . It is crucial to weed out trading anomalies that are a reaction to news as opposed to those that are predictors of news . This involves determining if news is “ market moving ” news or just an unimportant press release or tangential news .
( cid:131 ) There are relational interactions among companies . News about one company may cause abnormal trading in another . An earnings announcement by Microsoft may cause trading anomalies in Intel options . The acquisition of one bank may cause abnormal trading for other banks .
The problem affords opportunities for combinations of feature construction , text mining , and learning from relational data . The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 describes options and option markets explaining why traders with inside information often use options . Section 3 describes the symptoms of insider trading in options and also gives two case studies . Section 4 presents the original data and describes steps taken to transform data from the option “ series level ” to the “ company level ” which was more conducive to learning . Section 5 describes experiments comparing a model manually built from expert knowledge to learned models . Also described are experiments with unsupervised algorithms to extract unknown relationships . Sections 6 and 7 discuss related work and future work .
2 . OPTIONS A “ call ” is an option to buy a specific stock at a specific price on or before a specific date . For example , an investor may buy an option to buy Microsoft stock ( MSFT ) at $30 on or before March 20 , 2004 . The stock is called the “ underlying stock ” ( MSFT ) . The price is called the “ strike price ” ( $30 ) . The date is called the “ expiration ” date ( March 20 , 2004 ) because the investor ’s option to buy expires on that date . If the market price of MSFT is above $30 on March 20 , then the owner of the option will choose to “ exercise ” their option , buy the stock at $30 , and possibly turn around and immediately sell the stock at the higher market price . When the price of MSFT is above the strike price , the option is said to be “ in the money . ” When the price of MSFT is below the strike price , the option is “ out of the money . ” Options that are inthe money on the expiration date are exercised . Options that are out of the money on the expiration date simply expire worthless and are not exercised . Because it is an option , the owner is not obligated to buy the stock at the exercise price . An investor would buy a call when they expect the underlying stock to go up . A “ put ” is an option to sell a specific stock at a specific price on or before a specific date . So a put is complementary to a call . A put is in the money when the price of the underlying stock is below the exercise price . An investor would buy a put when they expect the underlying stock to go down . For any given underlying stock there will be many different options trading on any given day . There will be both puts and calls . For both there will be multiple different strike prices , some in the money and some out of the money . For all of these , there will be multiple expiration dates – some less than a month away , some up to 2 years away . Options with the same strike price , same expiration date , and same type or “ class ” ( call or put ) are said to be in the same “ series . ” An underlying stock often has between 20 and 120 series of options trading on a given day . Options amplify an investor ’s gains ( and losses ) and this makes them appealing to people with inside information . For example , consider someone who knows that XYZ Corp is going to be acquired in the next couple of weeks , and their stock price is likely to jump from $50 to $55 . If they simply buy XYZ stock at $50 , they make a 10 % profit when it jumps to $55 . But if they buy a call ( with a strike price of $50 ) for $1 , that call will be worth at least $5 after the jump . The trader has made a 400 % profit instead of a 10 % profit . The risk is that the acquisition doesn’t happen as soon as expected , and the stock stays at $50 . In this case the option expires worthless , and the option trader has a 100 % loss as opposed to the stock trader who breaks even . But if the person is fairly confident of their information , there is much to be gained from buying calls . There are several factors that determine the price of an option . The most obvious is how far in or out of the money the option is . A call that is $2 in the money is going to be worth more than a similar call ( same underlying , same expiration ) that is $3 out of the money . A second factor is the time remaining until expiration . The more time until expiration , the more an option will cost because there is more time for the price of the underlying to move around . When a person buys a call , they are paying to be able to keep their options open on whether or not they will buy at a specific price . The longer they are allowed to keep their options open , the more they will have to pay . People with inside information are likely to favor options with near term expiration dates because the news they know about is likely to happen soon , and near term options maximize their percent return because they are less expensive . A third factor is the “ volatility ” of the underlying stock . Volatility has to do with how much the stock price moves around and how rapidly it moves . Options on a volatile stock will cost more than on a non volatile stock because it is more likely the underlying price will end up in the money . Other less important factors include the current interest rates and whether or not the stock will issue a dividend before the exercise date . The exact relationship among these factors is described by the Black Scholes equations
[ 4 ] , and common practice is to plug them into a Black Scholes calculator which returns a price . Of these factors , most can be measured exactly with the exception of volatility because it is the future volatility that matters – the volatility between now and the expiration date . In lieu of knowing future volatility , recent historical volatility is often used as an estimate . Because volatility is the only factor that cannot be measured exactly , it often becomes a catch all input for other factors that cannot be explicitly entered into Black Scholes . For example , supply and demand for options affect price , uncertainty about a pending court case affects price , etc . For this reason , an important concept is an option ’s “ implied volatility . ” That is the volatility that is implied by the price . This is calculated by taking the option ’s real , market price and reverse engineering the volatility that would have been input to get that price . “ Implied volatility ” measures how “ pricy ” an option is and can be used to compare options with different underlying stocks , strike prices , and expiration dates . 3 . SYMPTOMS OF INSIDER TRADING When inside information is leaked , rumors start to swirl , and people trade on those rumors . This trading is known to manifest itself in certain ways in trading data . The first half of this section presents several “ symptoms ” of insider trading that one can observe in option trading data . Most of these are taken from McMillian [ 5 ] which presents a mostly manual method of looking for insider trading . The second half of the section presents two case studies of abnormal trading that preceded material news ( “ material news ” being news that greatly affected a company ’s stock price ) . l e m u o V n o i t p O

Calls Puts
Figure 1 . Example rise in option trading volume
The primary symptom is a jump in the volume of options traded . If there is a jump in the volume of calls traded , this would indicate good news ( anticipating stock price increase ) ; puts would indicate bad news ( anticipating decrease ) . The volume of options with near term expiration dates ( within the next couple of months ) is particularly important because inside knowledge is usually about events that will occur in the next couple of months , and near term options give a higher percent return . Figure 1 shows an example rise in call volume . Historically , call volume has been around 1000 contracts per day ( a contract is an option for 100 shares ) . Suddenly around July 12 , the volume of calls rises to 4000 and then to above 8000 .
A related symptom is that there is an imbalance in the volume of calls to the volume of puts . This is because inside information is usually directional – the stock price will rise or fall . A lot more calls than puts would indicate good news ; more puts than calls would indicate bad news . If the volume of both rise together , this does not indicate a direction . It may mean there is big news coming , but there is disagreement among traders as to whether it will be good news or bad news . This often happens before scheduled earnings releases – traders know there will be news , but some think it will be good and others think it will be bad . In the example in Figure 1 , the volume of puts increases some , but there are still four times as many calls traded . Some stocks may trade a high volume of calls one day and then trade a high volume of puts a few days later and then calls again the next day . This lack of direction would indicate that the volume is probably not driven by people with inside knowledge . Another symptom is that implied volatility often increases . Recall that implied volatility is a measure of how “ pricy ” an option is . If insiders are buying a lot of options , demand will outpace supply resulting in an increase in the relative expensiveness of the options . This will be reflected in a rising implied volatility . Implied volatility can also be an indicator of uncertainty . Abnormal trading makes traders wonder what is up and increases their uncertainty of the stock ’s future movements . l e m u o V n o i t p O

Figure 2 . Volume distributed over prices and expirations
There are other reasons than inside information that cause option volume to increase . A mutual fund may have a large position in XYZ stock and sell calls because they think XYZ is near the top of its trading range . This is called writing covered calls . A trader may create a “ spread ” by buying a lot of calls at one strike price and selling an equal number of calls at a different strike price . These false positives can sometimes be weeded out by looking at the distribution of volume among the various series ( strike prices and expiration dates ) . Inside information often leads to volume distributed over multiple strike prices and expiration dates as in Figure 2 . This is because some inside traders will prefer slightly in the money options while some will prefer out of the money for higher returns . Some will prefer options with more time until expiration while some will prefer shorter expirations for higher returns .
Figure 4 plots the call and put volume in the days leading up to the news . Call and put volume were generally below 1000 contracts per day with a few exceptions in mid August . On both Sept 17 and 18 , there was unusually high put volume ( over 4000 contracts ) and even on Sept 12 put volume was at 2000 . Meanwhile call volume remained relatively normal . Option volume after Sept 18 is not shown because the news caused volume to jump off the scale . Also shown in Figure 4 is the stock price so the drop between Sept 18 and 19 can be seen .

Figure 3 . Volume concentrated in one price and expiration
Figure 3 shows a volume distribution pattern more indicative of covered call writing . Real volume distributions are rarely this clean and crisp , but odd volume distributions with gaps , round number of contracts , or near identical peaks can sometimes indicate other reasons for option volume . Some symptoms may also be evident in the market for the underlying stock . There may be increased volume , but the increases may be small compared to normal trading volume . There may also be an abnormal increase or decrease in the stock price . If there are rumors about bad news , enough people may sell or short the stock to drive the price down some . The following two subsections give case studies of two companies that released unscheduled news , and the news was preceded by abnormal trading patterns . The first case study for EDS involves high put volume followed by bad earnings news and a price drop . The second case study for Pharmacia involves high call volume followed by an acquisition announcement and a price jump . 3.1 Case Study #1 On Sept 18 , 2002 EDS stock closed at $3646 After the market closed , EDS announced that it “ expects its Q3 revenues and earnings to be lower than previous company guidance . ” On the following morning , EDS opened at $21.90 and fell to $17.20 by the end of the day ( down 53% ) . A person who bought puts with a strike price of $35 expiring in Sept on Sept 18 for $0.40 could have sold them the 19th for $17.70 , a 43 fold increase . r P k c o t S

Figure 7 . EDS option volume distribution on Sept 18
Regarding stock price and volume , the price of EDS stock dropped 4.5 % on the 17th and 3.4 % on the 18th indicating selling pressure on those two days . Additionally , the stock volume was about 20 % above normal on the 17th and 18th . In summary , in the days before a large drop in EDS stock price due to the release of negative news , the following trading patterns were observed : put volume jumped over four fold while call volume remained fairly normal , implied volatility rose , put volume was distributed over several series , and stock volume was high while stock prices fell . 3.2 Case Study #2 On Friday , July 12 , 2002 Pharmacia stock ( PHA ) closed at $3259 Over the weekend , there was an announcement that Pfizer was acquiring Pharmacia . On Monday , July 15 , PHA opened sharply higher and closed at $39.25 , a rise of over 20 % . A person who bought July/$35 calls on July 12 for $0.55 could have sold them the 15th for $4.10 , a 650 % increase .

Figure 11 . PHA stock volume
Regarding stock price and volume , Figure 11 shows that volume of the PHA stock rose to double the normal volume in the three days preceding the acquisition . Stock price dropped July 10 but rose modestly both the 11th and 12th .
In summary , in the days leading up to a Pharmacia acquisition announcement and a 20 % rise in the stock price , the following trading patterns were observed : call volume jumped over five fold while put volume rose only modestly , implied volatility rose , call volume was distributed over several series , and stock volume doubled while stock prices rose modestly . 4 . DATA SOURCES & PREPARATION One of the primary challenges of applying data mining techniques to early detection of insider trading is that the important information is very spread out . It is spread over multiple trading days . On any given trading day , the information is spread over multiple different option series ( call/put , strike price , expiration date ) . It is often spread over multiple news articles . The raw data is about individual series on individual trading dates . But people do not have inside information about a series , they have information about an underlying company . And inside information is not confined to single dates ; rather it starts small on one date and spreads as time passes . Much of the problem solving work goes into transforming the problem from the “ series level ” to the “ company level ” and from looking at individual trade dates to looking at trade dates in the context of their recent history . The first subsection explains the raw data and how much of it is at the “ series level . ” The second subsection explains the transformation to the “ company level ” and how important concepts such as “ near term put/call imbalance ” and “ ‘good’ distribution among strike prices and expiration dates ” are represented . The third subsection addresses how information from text was integrated with trade data , and the fourth subsection tells how a labeled dataset was created . 4.1 Raw Data Raw data came from three sources : option trading , stock trading , and news . Stock and option data were available on all US companies for which options are trades ( about 2160 companies ) . News covered these companies plus others . The date range for which all three data sources were available covered a six month time period from March 11 , 2003 to Sept 17 , 2003 . Option data consisted of a daily summary for each option series . So there is an entry each day for each stock ’s combination of call/put , strike price , and expiration date . There were between 110,000 and 130,000 rows of data per day or about 50 to 60 series per stock on average . The available data fields were : option symbol , underlying stock symbol , trade date , class ( call or put ) , strike price , year and month of expiration , volume ( number of contracts traded ) , closing bid price ( price at which buyers will buy ) , closing ask price ( price at which sellers will sell ) , and open interest . Stock data consisted of daily summaries for each company . The available fields were : stock symbol , company name , trade date , opening price , high price , low price , closing price , and volume ( number of shares traded ) . News was available from several sources . Press releases came from Business Wire and PR Newswire . News stories came from Dow Jones , Reuters , and the Associated Press . Each news story consisted of a title and body in ASCII and a list of stock symbols mentioned in the story . There were often multiple stock symbols per article . 20 % of press releases contained multiple stock symbols . 68 % of news stories contained multiple stock symbols .
4.2 “ Series Level ” to “ Company Level ” Our goal was to create “ mid level ” features that could be used for discovery by data mining algorithms . This is as opposed to “ highlevel ” features that completely solve the problem and “ low level ” features such as were in the raw data . The desired features should measure some aspect of how a company ’s trading deviates from its own normal behavior [ 2 ] . Not every anomaly is interesting , though . When data mining algorithms are applied to these , the goal is to find trends in the anomalies . 27 features were constructed from the equity and option data that measured the five high level symptoms discussed in Section 3 . 421 High Option Volume High volume indicates interest in a particular company , and 12 features were included to measure this concept . These were actually six features calculated once for calls and once for puts . The call measurements are kept separate from the puts to preserve directionality . The first was near term call ( put ) volume . This was calculated simply by summing across all the call ( put ) series for each company on each trading date . This gives an absolute measurement of interest in the company . If only 50 calls trade , this may not be interesting even if it is abnormally high for that company . It shows whether the trading was in round amounts ( eg exactly 500 contracts may indicate one large trade ) or in nonround ( eg 537 contracts may indicate multiple smaller trades ) . Two features that measure relative volume were how many times average the volume was and how many standard deviations above average the volume was ( z Score ) . The average and standard deviation of near term call ( put ) volume were calculated over the previous 20 trading days ( because there are approximately 20 trading days in a month ) . These measure whether trading volume is high relative to recent history . A separate way of measuring interest in a company is to look at the change in open interest . “ Open interest ” is the number of contracts that are outstanding for a particular series . If traders are opening new positions , then a high volume will result in a rise in open interest . But traders may simply be closing old positions and opening new ones . While this might result in a high volume , it does not necessarily indicate an abnormally high interest in the company . One feature was percent change in call ( put ) open interest from the previous day . A second feature divided today ’s percent change in open interest by the average change over the last 20 trading days . The last pair of features measured the number of days in the last five days that call ( put ) volume had exceeded two times the twenty day moving average . 422 Call Put Imbalance An imbalance between the volume of puts and calls indicates directionality . More calls than puts indicates optimism . More puts than calls indicates pessimism . One feature is simply the ratio of today ’s near term call volume to put volume . On high volume days , this is an indicator of directionality and how strong . A second feature compares call volume to recent high put volume . Instead of comparing to the average put volume over the last 20 days , today ’s call volume is compared to the average put volume of the three days out of the last 20 that had the highest put volume . This is because it is assumed that this feature will only be of interest if there is a high call volume today . Therefore it makes sense to compare today ’s call volume to days with high put volume . Some companies have high put volume one day and high call volume the next , and that does not necessarily indicate interest with directionality . This feature allows a measurement of that back and forth behavior . A similar feature compares today ’s put volume to recent high call volume . 423 Implied Volatility Implied volatility is a measure of uncertainty about a company and how “ pricy ” their options . The implied volatility is first calculated for each series using the midpoint between the bid and ask prices and reverse engineering Black Scholes . The near term implied volatility is found by averaging implied volatility from series expiring in the next two months . Only series whose strike prices are close to the current equity price ( closest 4 strike prices , two on either side ) are used . The implied volatilities of series that are too far in the money or out of the money have a lot of noise and can distort the measurement . To get a measure of whether implied volatility is higher or lower than usual , a second feature divides the current implied volatility by the 20 day average . 424 Distribution Distribution is more difficult to quantify . In general a more spread out distribution is better than a concentrated one . But there are other factors such as gaps and whether the distribution is at strike prices close to the stock price . Another factor is how close the next expiration date is . If it is a couple weeks away , distribution over two expiration dates is expected . But few traders will open a position on an expiration date that is only a couple days away . This is an area where future work in automated feature construction would likely have a good payoff . For these experiments , the three features user were :
( cid:131 ) Percent of near term call volume in the top series ( series with the highest volume ) .
( cid:131 ) Percent of near term call volume in the top two series . ( cid:131 ) Percent of near term call volume in the top three series . If the percent in the top series is 95 % , this indicates all the call volume is concentrated in on series . If the percent in the top three series is 75 % , this indicates that volume is spread over several series . Three similar features measure put distribution . 425 Stock Behavior Inside information may also be reflected to a lesser degree in stock trading . It is worthwhile to check stock behavior to see if it confirms or contradicts what is seen in option behavior . One feature compares stock volume to the 20 day moving average . A second feature measures the percent change in the stock price over the last two days . A moderate rise in stock price can indicate buying interest , but a large increase may mean the option volume is probably a reaction to news , not a predictor of it . 426 Features from Expert Model Two features from an expert model described in Appendix A were the one day score from the model and the sum of the scores from the model over the last five days . Interestingly , these features were not used very much by the learning algorithms . 4.3 Integrating Text An additional 8 features were extracted from business news . The news analysis was used primarily to tell if trading anomalies were reactions to news or predictors of news . The biggest challenge to this is separating “ material ” news ( important news ) from the steady stream of unimportant news . To do this we relied on two basic principles :
( cid:131 ) Material news often falls into a few categories such as earnings announcements , research reports , mergers and acquisitions , regulatory approvals or denials , and product announcements [ 3 ] . Articles of these types can often be identified by commonly used words or phrases . ( cid:131 ) When there really is material news , it is usually reported in multiple different sources creating a spike in news volume as compared with recent history .
We used a two phase approach to quantify these characteristics . The first phase extracted features from each news article and flattened them onto a feature vector . The second phase created a daily news profile for each company . The two phases are discussed in greater detail below . By finding common words and phrases , each article was assigned multiple scores along several dimensions such as :
( cid:131 ) Was this good news , bad news , or neutral ? ( cid:131 ) Was this about an earnings release or prerelease ? ( cid:131 ) Was this about an upgrade or downgrade ? ( cid:131 ) Was this about a lawsuit or scandal ? ( cid:131 ) Was this about a merger or acquisition ? ( cid:131 ) Was this about FDA approval of a drug ?
While this was done in a fairly crude manner ( a PERL script that counts instances of key words and phrases ) , it proved to be fairly good at categorizing news because the same words and phrases are used over and over again in business news . These were then rolled up into a company news profile that had a feature vector for each company for each day . If there was no news for a company on a given day , there was no vector . Three features measured the significance of the news on that day :
( cid:131 ) Max good news score . This returned the highest “ good news ” score for that company that day .
( cid:131 ) Max bad news score . This returned the highest “ bad news ” score for that company that day .
( cid:131 ) Max significant news score . This summed all the “ material news ” scores for each article and took the highest score for that company that day .
Another five features measured the volume of news and compared it to the previous 30 days :
( cid:131 ) One day count . Number of articles mentioning company today .
( cid:131 ) Three day count . Number of articles mentioning company in last three days .
( cid:131 ) Thirty day count . Number of articles mentioning company in last thirty days .
( cid:131 ) One/Thirty ratio . One day count / Thirty day count ( cid:131 ) Three/Thirty ratio . Three day count / Thirty day count
If there was unusual trading on a given day , the learning algorithms could use these eight features to determine if it was simply a reaction to news .
4.4 Creating Labels A data element represented a specific company on a specific date . An element was labeled positive if within the next two weeks after the date , there was significant news that led to a sizable increase in stock price . ( The experiments in this paper focus only on the task of predicting positive news and upward movements in a stock . The flip side of the problem – predicting negative news – is similar but not entirely symmetrical and thus brings out a different set of issues . In practice puts and calls are traded for different reasons . Calls are often traded by speculators while puts are often traded to hedge downward risk . ) A company was considered to have significant news if any of the following three conditions held 1 ) the number of articles on a company was greater on one day than 25 % of the sum of the previous 30 days or 2 ) the company had an article with a score greater than zero in one of the “ significant news ” categories or 3 ) the company had an article with a “ good news ” score >= 5 . A company was considered to have a sizable stock price increase if all of the following three conditions held : 1 ) the stock price increased by more than 5 % in one day and 2 ) the company was in the top 2 % of price gainers and 3 ) the price increased by more than $50 These factors taken together were found to be pretty good indicators of a public announcement of market moving news that someone could have had advance knowledge of . While the date range of the dataset was from March 11 to Sept 17 , the range of the labeled data was from April 21 to Sept 10 . Thirty days were left off at the beginning of the range because the news profile needed a thirty day history to be accurate . One week was left off the end because this gave a week after Sept 10 for a significant news event to occur so that the last elements could be labeled positive . This left 100 trade days in the dataset . To filter out trading that was not unusual at all , data elements were excluded if the company ’s call volume on that day was not at least two times the 20 day moving average . The choice of two times was taken as an expert suggestion from [ 5 ] but could be parameterized in future experiments . This filtered the original 216,294 “ company days ” ( approximately 2160 companies on 100 days ) down to 5,848 data elements ( approximately 2.7 % of the original “ company days ” ) . Of these 5,848 , there were 458 labeled positive ( 7.8 % ) and 5,390 labeled negative ( 922 % ) A jump in a stock ’s price does not always involve insider trading . Even taken together with high volumes and other trading irregularities , it certainly looks suspicious , but it does not prove insider trading . The instances in this dataset labeled positive are not proven cases of insider trading but instead should be viewed as “ suspicious ” or “ worth reviewing . ”
5 . EXPERIMENTS The experiments can be described as follows : Given that call volume was high on a given trade date ( double the 20 day moving average ) , predict whether the stock will jump on material news within the next two weeks . This amounts to predicting the “ label ” field described in the previous section . The data was divided into a training set and a test set . Training data came from the dates April 21 to July 31 ( 72 trade days ) , and test data came from Aug 1 to Sept 10 ( 28 trade days ) . This is a realistic approximation of a real world implementation of the task where a model would be trained on a recent period and would be used to predict the subsequent time period .
Three algorithms were evaluated : C4.5 [ 6 ] , backwards stepwise logistic regression , and neural networks . All models were built using Clementine 80 For comparison , a manually built expert model was also tested . The model was adapted from expert indicators described in [ 5 ] and also described in Section 3 of this paper . At a high level , the model is a weighted combination of evidence where evidence for insider trading is added to a score , and evidence against is subtracted from the score . The model is described in greater detail in Appendix A . C4.5 was run with default parameters ( pruning severity of 75 % and a minimum of 2 records per child branch ) . Misclassification costs were set at 10 for false negatives and 1 for false positives to compensate for the skewed distribution of positives and negatives . The backwards stepwise logistic regression algorithm starts with a model containing all features and iteratively removes features that don’t add value ( also features that were previously removed may be added back in ) . The default Clementine parameters were used . Neural networks were used with the prune method where the initial network has a large number of hidden layer units , and the weakest units are the default Clementine parameters were used . Figures 12 , 13 , and 14 focus on three different portions of the same lift curve . Figure 12 gives the whole lift curve from 0 % to 100 % in order to show performance over the full range of data . Of the three algorithms , none clearly outperformed the other two over the entire range . If fact , their performance was roughly the same . Logistic regression outperformed in the 20 % to 50 % range . The neural net outperformed in the 50 % to 80 % range . Decision trees performed the best in the 0 % to 10 % range , and this will be examined further below . The expert model performed only slightly better than random for the full range but better in the lower ranges as examined below . iteratively removed . Again , s e v i t i s o P f o t n e c r e P

Figure 13 focuses on the portion of the lift curve from 0 % to 10 % . This is the portion of the curve that would be most important for analysts looking for quality leads to focus on for further investigation of insider trading . In this section of the curve , C4.5 outperformed the other approaches . Neural nets and logistic regression performed slightly worse and similar to the expert model . Since the expert model was designed for analysts who would only be investigating the best alerts and ignoring the rest , it is not surprising that it performs better in the lower part of the curve and relatively poor on the upper 90 % of the curve . s e v i t i s o P f o t n e c r e P

Overall , while the expert model did well for the lowest part of the curve , learning algorithms were superior on the rest of the curve . Decision trees performed best on the crucial portion between 0 % and 10 % . If an analyst were to investigate 8 % of the 5,848 possible alerts from the 100 trading days , this would amount to about 5 alerts per day , a reasonable workload . Using the C4.5 model would roughly double the hit rate over random selection and would give a hit rate 45 % higher than the expert model . 5.1 Examination of Models Produced The model produced by logistic regression used eight features : implied volatility , change in implied volatility , call volume times average , call volume standard deviations above average , call/put ratio , call/recent put ratio , number of news articles that day , and how many of the last five days have had call volume double the moving average . Implied volatility and its change were the strongest features in the model . The model did not select companies with rising implied volatility , but instead selected companies with very high implied volatility that had remained steadily high for the last 20 days . This makes sense that companies that are known to be the most volatile might be volatile sometime in the near future . These might reflect situations where news is expected , but it is unknown whether it will be good or bad . The model was less likely to select companies with a lot of news on that day . This makes sense because the trading is more likely to be a reaction to news in those cases . The model was less likely to select companies that had multiple days in the last five where call volume was double the average . This was unexpected . High call volume on multiple days in a week would be expected to indicate interest , but in high volatility options it could also indicate news broke in the last week , and the volume and the volatility are a reaction to news . So it makes sense in the context of this model . The decision tree algorithm produced a much larger model . Some highlights from that model include :
( cid:131 ) Implied volatility <= 0.31 almost never were positives . ( cid:131 ) High implied volatility ( > 0.83 ) with volume distributed over more than two series , were likely to be positive .
( cid:131 ) Moderate implied volatility where there had been a big jump in implied volatility were likely to be negative . A big jump in volatility could indicate a reaction to news . ( cid:131 ) Change in open interest was a complex predictor . Values near zero were labeled negative ( the volume is simply people closing one call contract and opening another ) . Moderately high values indicated positive while very high values indicated negative ( which came as a surprise but probably indicated a reaction to news ) . Finally , a large drops in open interest was a strong predictor of positive on a small number of examples .
5.2 Discussion of Supervised Results All three algorithms produced lift over random and over the expert model . No algorithm clearly outperformed the others . The amount of lift was not breath taking , but it was reasonable given the difficulty of the problem . This is especially true given that the examples that did not have high call volume ( the best indicator ) had already been pre filtered from the dataset leaving only those that were most difficult to classify . Analysis of the models revealed some model logic that supported expectations . Other model logic contradicted conventional wisdom . Implied volatility was found to be a very good predictor while increase in implied volatility was less important than anticipated . When conventional wisdom was contradicted , usually an explanation was found such as indicating a reaction to news . 5.3 Clustering Results In addition to supervised techniques , K Means clustering was run on the positively labeled examples to see if there were any naturally occurring groupings among the positives .
( cid:131 ) Two clusters were found with significant news on the day of the alert . One of these clusters also had high volumes of both calls and puts – this probably represents the rare case where material news was followed up within two weeks by more material news .
( cid:131 ) One cluster had high scores by the expert model . This may indicate that the expert model captures one class of trading anomaly , but not all . Interestingly , this cluster had relatively low call volume .
( cid:131 ) Another cluster was distinguished by high implied volatility , increasing volatility , and also high call volume compared to other clusters .
6 . RELATED WORK Our work was inspired by McMillian ’s hypothesis in [ 5 ] that people with inside information leave evidence in option trading data that might predict news . McMillian ’s method was mostly manual and required a large amount of human intuition and manual analysis . The goal of our work was to automate the analysis and discover unknown relationships . SONAR [ 3 ] is a live system used by NASD analysts to investigate insider trading . SONAR starts its analysis by finding material news and then looks backwards in time to find trading anomalies . This approach works quite well for regulators whose goal is to prosecute inside traders after the fact . The goal of our work was to find insider trading before the news becomes public . Westphal and Blaxton [ 7 ] use data mining to find cyclical price manipulation where fraudsters buy stock , drive the price of the stock up , sell their stock , wait for the price to settle down , and then repeat the cycle . They refer to this scheme as “ insider trading , ” but they really are using the phrase differently than we are . 7 . FUTURE WORK There are many directions the work could be taken . There are relationships among companies such that news in one company affects trading in another company . Or news in one bellwether stock may affect trading in a whole industry . This information was not exploited in this paper , but it could be obtained from news [ 1 ] or publicly available industry classifications . Our work brought in some information from previous days by comparing to twenty day moving averages , looking at sliding three day windows for news , and looking at volume from the previous five trading days . There is still ample room for the addition of more sophisticated time series analysis . Our work was based on end of day summary data . Crucial detail is lost in the summarization process . For example , the number and size of trades during the day gives insight into whether volume is created by one large buyer or a number of small ones . Much of our work consisted of intelligently going from low level features to mid level features . This makes the problem of insider trading a prime candidate for applying automated feature construction . This could be done from scratch ( directly from the low level features ) or by starting with expert initiated features and mutating them . Our date range of data did not allow us to look for re occurring instances of trading anomalies , but it makes sense that if a company has a “ leak ” there might be trading anomalies before regularly scheduled news such as earnings announcements . A history of trading anomalies ( manifesting itself as seasonal changes around earnings release time ) that correctly predicted news could indicate a leak and be a predictor of future news . Other future directions include exploring put volume and downward movements , merging the expert model with learning , applying boosting , and using sophisticated text mining techniques to improve information extracted from the business news . 8 . SUMMARY Early detection of insider trading has many potential uses ranging from detecting terrorist plans to protecting investors . Because the information needed to solve the problem is spread out across many types of data ( text and structured , relational and nonrelational , company level and series level ) it poses many challenges for data mining and allows many technologies to be brought to bear on one problem . Our work synthesized option data and news and applied data mining to predict future news . Results both supported some expectations and revealed discoveries of previously unknown relationships . 9 .

APPENDIX A : EXPERT MODEL To calculate the daily score for an alert , the score was initialized to zero , and the following logic was used : If near term call volume > 300 and <= 1000 , score=score+3 If near term call volume > 1000 and <= 3000 , score=score+4 If near term call volume > 3000 , score=score+5 If call volume # StDev above average > 2 and <=4 , score=score+2 If call volume # StDev above average > 4 , score=score+4 If % call volume in top series > 40 and <= 50 , score=score+2 If % call volume in top series <= 40 , score=score+4 If call to recent high put vol ratio >1.3 and <=2 , score=score+1 If call to recent high put vol ratio >2 , score=score+2 If 2 day equity price increase > 11 % and <= 5 % , score=score 1 If 2 day equity price increase > 0 % and <= 5 % , score=score+1 If 2 day equity price increase > 5 % and <= 55 % , score=score+2 If near term call/put volume ratio > 3 and <= 6 , score=score+1 If near term call/put volume ratio > 6 , score=score+2 The final score for a company was the sum of the scores from the five most recent days ( but final score set to 0 if there was significant news that day or One/Thirty news ratio > 0.2 ) 11 .
