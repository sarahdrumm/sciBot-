1 . INTRODUCTION We are developing a technique of travel time prediction using real time traffic data such as probe car data . Our goal is to establish a method to predict travel time of a vehicle for an objective road section ( referred to as `link' ) , reflecting real time traffic conditions . Travel time prediction is an important subject in the area of Intelligent Transport System ( ITS ) , eg for the purpose of dynamic route guidance In usual route guidance system as of car navigation , the objective function in route search is the route length from an origin to the destination or the total travel time which is obtained based on predefined travel time of each link . Accuracy of the estimate of the total travel time will be improved if we employ the total travel time based on predicted travel time of each link at the time when the car will drive there . For this purpose , precise prediction of travel time reflecting real time traffic condition is important . Recently in particular , methods using probe car system are intensively studied . Probe car system is a data collection method using individual vehicles as moving sensors . Through this system , it is possible to collect various traffic data which concern much larger area than by traditional fixed sensors method . In this paper , we study methods to predict mean travel time of links based on the data collected by the probe car system . We treated the data of travel time as time series , which we created from each trip data of probe cars . For time series modeling , we employ AR model ( Auto Regression model ) and state space model [ 5 ] . These models have the parameters to be tuned , by which varieties of prediction functions are realized . In mining ( learning ) process , we tune such parameters based on the past traffic data in order to obtain precise prediction function . As for the AR model , the objective time series should be stationary . If not , we can not expect accurate prediction , but actual traffic phenomena have periodic pattern of one day ( or one week ) , and are usually nonstationary . Hence , straight forward application of AR model is not appropriate . We should remove such periodic patterns from the original time series . We do this by the technique of seasonal adjustment , ie we prepare a model of the periodic pattern based on past statistics of travel time and subtract the values given by the model from the original time series . To represent periodic patterns , we could employ various kinds of statistical models . We employ a table of travel times , which lists travel times for a specific link and specific time , etc . The table is usually made based on past statistics of travel times . This table represents the periodic patterns contained in the series of travel time and can be used as prediction method . This kind of prediction method , which is based on the past statistics , is widely employed , eg for forecasting the occurrences of traffic jams in holiday seasons . In this paper , we call such methods as `static method' . The proposed method treats the deviation of real time travel time information from those given by the static method by using the AR model . By this way , we can predict the travel time reflecting real time traffic conditions . The state space model , which is an alternative way to treat periodic nature in the time series of travel time , is fairly general representation of time series model . It includes AR model and MA ( moving average ) model as
817 to in Nagoya Metropolitan Area special cases , and in particular , can treat nonstationary nature of time series such as periodicity . One of purposes of our study is to utilize the information about not only the objective link but wide spread links which is available via probe car system . To do this , we employ the multidimensional statistical models . We refer the variables corresponding to the added links as explanatory variables . In this task , it is important to select really effective explanatory variables , since using ineffective variables affects prediction accuracy in general . We solve this problem in the context of model selection in statistics and learning theory . In fact we employ information criterion MDL ( Minimum Description Length ) [ 6 ] . It is known that learning based on this criterion can improve accuracy of prediction . We will show by cross validation using probe car data that prediction accuracy is improved by adding exploratory variables . Selection of exploratory variables can be thought of as knowledge acquisition . For example , if the section in front of the objective link is not selected , but that after the objective section is , then we learn that the latter has relation to the travel time . This is very simple case , but we might discover the relation which we cannot aware by usual observation . In this paper , we report certain experiments using probe car data collected in 2002 . There , approximately 1,500 probe taxis were operated [ 4 ] . We evaluated accuracy of our methods by cross validation . In particular , we showed that employing the AR mode improved accuracy compared to prediction by the travel time table even in the case without explanatory variables and that selecting explanatory variables by MDL was effective . The data from the probe car system contains rather many outliers , since the individual probecars drive at the driver's pleasure . Hence , we cleaned up the probe data before creating the time series of averaged travel time from the probe data . For this procedure , we employed an outlier detection engine SmartSifter.[10 ] We briefly review the related researches . Concerning the static methods , Kumagai et al . [ 5 ] and Chung [ 3 ] studied . In the former , they make clusters of daily patterns by principal component analysis and create a function which maps each day to a cluster by quantification theory III . This is smarter than the way of simple travel time table . In the latter , he employed clustering technique from data mining field . It is possible to employ these techniques in our work instead of simple travel time table . As a method by time series analysis , [ 7 ] is known . They employ artificial neural network as a prediction function . The rest of this paper is organized as follows : Section 2 describes the probe car data we use . Section 3 illustrates statistical model we employ in this work . We review AR model and theory of information criterion . In Section 4 , we state our experimental result . Section 5 contains our concluding remarks .
2 . PROBE CAR DATA We use the data collected in probe car experiment which has been conducted in Nagoya Metropolitan Area by ``Internet ITS Project ( Main body : Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry since 2002 ) . There , approximately 1,500 probe taxis have been operated [ 4 ] shows the objective links in this paper . The reason why we selected these links is that many probe data are available for them . In other related works , the objective links are usually high ways , where it is easier to predict travel time than for city roads since influence of signal and cross section does not exist .

The probe car data ( probe data for short ) are collected from each probe car at the defined time intervals and moment of the defined operations . Each record consists of time , car location , state of the car's devices such as wiper and brake . After some correction on location and some manipulation , we obtain a set of trip data for each link , which consists of , car ID , time when the car entered the link , time when the car exited from the link , difference of them ( travel time ) . We simplify the original format to the form
( start time of the trip , travel time ) .
Taking statistics of such trip data , we made time series of mean travel time in 15 minutes for each link . The resultant format of a record is ( s,i,T,W,N ) =(day of a week , time index , mean travel time , variance , #trips ) . Here , time index is an integer from 0 to 95 , with 0 corresponding to the interval 0:00 0:15 . The last field is the number of observed probe data in the time interval . We refer to the time series defined here as probe time series . By close observation of each trip data , we see that there exist obvious outliers . For example , the trip data , whose travel time is over 10 times longer than averaged values are seen . We can imagine a reason : the probe taxi stopped at some shop to wait the passenger's return from shopping . Such probe data have bad influence on our task . Hence , we clean up them by outlier detection technique , employing SmartSifter [ 10 ] . It is an outlier detection engine of statistical method . We removed the data corresponding 2 sigma outliers . ( Actually they were not 2 sigma outliers , since SmartSifter employed Gaussian mixture model . ) We prepared probe time series for 10 links in Nagoya ( Figure 1 ) from January 12th to March 31st , omitting the data for Saturdays and Sundays . Hence we have approximately 5,000 records of probe time series for each link . Let S be the set of all links . Let w be a vector of which components are T and N for elements of S . Note that w is a 20 dimensional vector . We refer to w as traffic information vector in this paper . Using index t , we let wt denote a traffic information vector which consists of tth records of each n denote a series wmwm+1…wn and wn probe time series . We let wm w1 n . Also , we let wt:a denote the ath component of wt .
3 . STATISTICAL MODEL AND
LEARNING STRATEGY 31 TRAVEL TIME TABLE Basically , we use AR model for time series modeling . It assumes that the data sequence is stationary , but this assumption is not valid for traffic information , which has periodic patterns with 24 hours and 7 days . Hence , we need to apply seasonal adjustment . In this paper , we do it for 24hours periodicity , using travel time table , which is basically in the similar format data as the probe time series but made ignoring the information of date . For each link , we can obtain the records
( T(i),W(i),,N(i))=(mean travel time , variance , #trips ) , where i is the time index . Note that the travel time table itself can be used for prediction . In Subsection 4.1 , we examine accuracy of this prediction method . Removing the values in the travel time table from each term in the probe time series , we have new time series . Now let ξt be a vector of which components are T(i ) and N(i ) of all elements of S , where t = i ( mod 96 ) . In other word , ξt is a term from periodic pattern , contained in wt . We define a new time series as xt = wt ξt . The averages of T , W , and N through xn are 0 . Also , it is expected to be stationary , approximately . The above travel time table can be modified as changing the time interval where mean is taken . For example , it can be 1 hour instead of 15 minutes . Then , we have a smoother cyclic pattern . Also , it is possible to replace each value with the average of the neighbor's value . Figure 2 shows graphs of travel time tables which we made from our probe time series . They are average for weekdays . second 60

33 STATE SPACE MODEL In this section we briefly review the theory of state space model [ 2][5 ] . This model can represent a great variety of time series models and handle nonstationary time series composed of AR model , seasonal component , and trend component . We denote observable time series data by wt with time index t . State space model can be described by the following two equations : y t
=

( 3 ) t , where yt denotes the inner state of assumed system at time t , which is not observable . The system noise νt and the observation noise εt are assumed to be iid ( independently identically distributed ) random variables with zero mean and covariance matrix Q and R , respectively . We can interpret that the equation ( 2 ) describes the evolution of the state yt and the equation ( 3 ) describes the observation process . Although we cannot directly observe the state yt , we can estimate it via observation wt using Kalman filter [ 2 ] . Here , we consider a complex nonstationary time series , which is seen in traffic time series data . In general , time series data can be decomposed into a trend component rt , a stationary component xt , seasonal component ξt , and observation noise component εt as wt = rt + xt + ξt + εt ( a special case of equation ( 3) ) . We assume that component xt can be described by an AR model of order p . The seasonal component with period L is a sequence ξt with the properties ξt = ξt L + δt . It can be generated by the recursions ξt = ξt 1 ξt 2 … ξt L+1 + δt , where δt is an iid sequence with variance τt . Here , we omit the trend component assuming that it is ignorable for our traffic information . We can express these components xt and ξt in state space form introducing a new state vector yt = [ xt xt 1 xt 2 … xt p+1 | ξt ξt 1 ξt 2 … ξt L+1 ] . The parameters to be estimated are AR coefficients and covariance matrices of system noise and observation noise . For fixed parameters and given data sequence , we can calculate the likelihood of the model using Kalman filter . Then , we can estimate the parameters maximizing the likelihood by numerical optimization method . Once we estimate the parameter , we can predict the value of wt using Kalman filter . the
34 MODEL SELECTION Suppose that the objective mean travel time for prediction is wt:1 the first component of vector w . This is referred to as an objective remaining component wt:2,…,wt:20 are variable . Here , explanatory variables , if we employ the AR model ( 1 ) as it is . However , this is wasteful . We should select the explanatory variables which are truly effective for prediction . Let M be a symbol to represent a way of such selection and G a set consisting of all M . Let z be a vector consisting of the objective variable and the explanatory variables specified by M with zt:1 = xt:1 . We let d' denote the dimension of z . When we specify M and the order k of AR model , an AR model with parameters is specified . We let ΘM,k be a parameter's range associated with the AR model specified by M and k . Let be the joint probability density function specified by M , k , and . kM ,Θ∈θ Here , our task is to select appropriate M and k , given the data xn . We do this using MDL ( Minimum Description Length ) [ 7][1 ] , which is defined as kM , zp (

Here , θ' consists of µ , the first lines of A ( j ) ( j=1,,k ) , and the ( 1,1 ) component of V . Hence , we have dim θ'd = d''+kd'+1 . The first term is referred to as data description length and the second term as parameter description length . The former is measure for the model's fitting to the data , while the latter is measure for complexity of the model . The data description length equals minus likelihood , which is what is maximized for maximum likelihood estimation . In general , the more complex the model comes , the shorter the data description length comes . Hence , it is no good to use likelihood as index for comparing models , whose complexity are different from each other . However , we can regularize the index by adding parameter description length as penalty for complex model . In fact , according to the MDL principle , we should select M and k which minimize MDL(zn,M,k ) . We refer to them as MDL estimate . It is known that the accuracy of prediction is optimized in terms of Hellinger distance , when we employ the MDL estimate under a certain regularization condition [ 1][9 ] .
35 PROPOSED METHOD Here , we summarize our methods by the charts illustrated in Figure 3 ( learning phase ) and Figure 4 ( prediction phase ) . These charts are for the method of AR model with travel time table . As for the state space model , the flow charts becomes much more simpler , we have only to replace the block indicated by broken line by the state space model .

4 . EXPERIMENT To examine our technique , we conducted 10 cross validation using the probe time series we prepared . Let D denote the whole data ( from Jan . 12th to March 31st ) . We separate it to ten subsets DT1 , DT2,…,DT10 with each being the time series of identical size . We let Di denote D DTi ( i=1,…,10 ) . We refer to Di and DTi as learning data and test data , respectively . In 10 cross validation , at ith stage , we learn the prediction function using Di and measure the prediction error of the obtained function for the test data DTi . We perform this stage for i=1 to 10 and average these 10 errors .
By this procedure , we can guess accuracy of our technique for newly observed data . We employ the mean squared error ( MSE for short ) . Assume that we have xn as the test data . For them , we txˆ is the calculate the error as ) x t 1 . We let Error(i ) denote the predicted value for xt based on xt k 1 mean squared error obtained in the ith stage . The final averaged error is . We also use square root of MSE ∑ = 10 1i ( RMSE for short ) .

41 TRAVEL TIME TABLE AND 1
DIMENSIONAL AR MODEL
We evaluated MSE and RMSE of the prediction made by the travel time table method and the combination method of travel time table and AR model . In this case we didn't add any links as explanatory variables . The following tables show the result of all links . We can see from these tables that accuracy was improved for all links using the AR method .

42 MODEL SELECTION First , we examine the case where we use only one link for an explanatory variable . Table 3 shows the results for objective links l03 , l04 , l05 , and l06 . The second column indicates the explanatory variable we used . In this column , ` 1' ( `+1' ) means that the travel time of downstream ( upstream ) link of the objective link was added as a explanatory variable and ` 2' ( `+2' ) means its downstream ( upstream ) link's travel time was added . Note that the values of MDL listed here were obtained with the whole data set D , while MSE and RMSE were obtained with the subset Di corresponding to each objective link . We indicate the minimum values of MDL and MSE of each link by gray cells . From these results , we can see that accuracy was improved compared to the case without an explanatory variable when we selected the model which minimizes MDL . Next , we examine the case where we use multiple links for explanatory variables . We evaluated the MDL of all combinations of neighbor link's travel time as exploratory variables . We list the combination which minimized MDL for objective links l03 , l04 , l05 , and l06 in table 5 with MSE . Here , `y' means that we used the link as an explanatory variable . Also , we list the combination which minimized MSE for the same objective links in Table 5 . From these results , we conclude that model selection by MDL can choose the nearly best combination of the neighbor links to predict travel time except for the objective link l06 . As for l06 , we could not observe significant correlation between MDL and MSE . We think that this is because l06 link is close to a large crossing and the influence of the signal on the crossing was large . Besides RMSE , we examine accuracy of our method by relative error too , which we defined by absolute prediction error divided by observed mean travel time . Concerning the listed combination of explanatory variables , the averaged relative errors were 27.7 % , 28.7 % , 36.5 % , and 38.3 % , respectively for l03 , l04 , l05 , and l06 .

43 STATE SPACE MODEL We compared the method of AR model with time table to that of state space model . For this evaluation , we prepared the probe time series where one record is the value for 60 minutes . This is because the computational cost of the Kalman filter is of order O ( L3 ) , where L is the assumed period length . For probe time series in our experiment , the proper value of L is 24 when one record is for 60 minutes , while it is 96 when one record is for 15 minutes ( 4 records per hour and 96 records per day ) . In the latter case , computational cost is too high to conduct the experiment . Similarly , owing to time restriction , we did not employ any additional explanatory variables . Table 6 shows the results by these two methods . We can see that MSE for AR model with time table is much better and almost as half as that for state space model . This is because the periodic pattern in traffic time series is not necessarily stable and randomly changes . State space model estimates periodic pattern under the influence of the pattern right before . Hence , the periodic component in state space model is too sensitive to such random changes , while the periodic pattern by the travel time table is robust to them . Although time table ’s robustness might be appropriate for this data , further investigation should be necessary for a variety of data .

5 . CONCLUSIONS Concerning the prediction of future travel time using real time traffic data from probe car system , we have examined accuracy of the two methods : AR model with travel time table and state space model . As for the latter method , it was significantly inferior to the former method in our experiment . It is probably because of instablity of the data from probe car system . We think that further investigation will be instructive . As for the former method , we have shown that our method is more effective than the time table method alone and that the prediction accuracy is improved by using explanatory variables selected by MDL principle .
