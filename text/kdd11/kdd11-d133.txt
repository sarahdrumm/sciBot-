ABSTRACT The history of humankind is intimately connected to insects . Insect borne diseases kill a million people and destroy tens of billions of dollars worth of crops annually . However , at the same time , beneficial insects pollinate the majority of crop species , and it has been estimated that approximately one third of all food consumed by humans is directly pollinated by bees alone . Given the importance of insects in human affairs , it is somewhat surprising that computer science has not had a larger impact in entomology . We believe in sensor technology are beginning change this , and a new field of Computational Entomology will emerge . We will demonstrate an inexpensive sensor that allows us to capture data from flying insects , and the software that allows us to analyze the data . Moreover , we will distribute both the sensors and software for free , to parties willing to take part in a crowdsourcing project on insect classification .

INTRODUCTION Humankind's history and its destiny are intimately connected to insects . Insect borne diseases kill well over a million people each year , and sicken tens of millions more [ 16 ] . Insects also destroy tens of billions of dollars worth of crops and livestock . However , at the same time beneficial insects pollinate 75 % of crop species , and it has been estimated that 30 % of all food consumed by humans is directly pollinated by bees alone [ 5 ] . Given the importance of insects to humans , researchers have developed an arsenal of mechanical , chemical , biological , economic and educational tools to help mitigate their harmful effects . Since all such interventions are costly , they depend on knowing the best time and place to intervene . As a group of medical entomologists recently noted just in the context of mosquitoes : “ Accurately georeferenced data are crucial for understanding mosquito biogeography , ecology , and the impact of environmental changes , as well as for species distribution modeling , planning mosquito surveys , and for determining disease risk ” [ 8 ] . Such data is currently obtained by having humans inspect mechanical or “ sticky ” traps . As such , the data are typically sparse , error prone and out of date . In this demonstration we show simple low cost sensors we can get accurate counts of flying insects in real time . We believe that these sensors will open up a new area of research , computational entomology . We argue that computational entomology is a branch of data mining ( rather than say , machine learning or biostatistics ) , because it draws from such traditional data mining techniques as classification , regression , clustering , etc . Furthermore , the classic data mining problems of scalability and dealing with distributed and uncertain data are unavoidable in any task in this domain . 2 . OUR INSECT WINGBEAT SENSOR Incredibly , the idea of classification of insects by sound dates back to the very dawn of computers and commercially available audio recording equipment . In 1945 , three researchers at the Cornell University Medical College , Kahn , Celestin and Offenhauser used equipment donated by Oliver E . Buckley ( then President of the Bell Telephone Laboratories ) to record and analyze mosquito sounds [ 12 ] . The authors later wrote “ It is the authors' considered opinion that the intensive application of such apparatus will make possible the precise , rapid , and simple observation of natural phenomena related to the sounds of disease carrying mosquitoes and should lead to the more effective control of such mosquitoes and of the diseases that they transmit . ” [ 13 ] . In retrospect it seems astonishing that more progress on this problem has not been made in the intervening years . The logical design of the sensor is shown in Figure 1 . It consists of a side by side low powered laser source/phototransistor . The latter is connected to an electronic board . The laser is pointed at a total internal reflector which returns the slightly scattered light back to the source , with some of it hitting the phototransistor .

Figure 1 : The logical general design of the insect sensor we are developing . It can count insects by recording high amplitude “ bleeps ” in the signal , classification takes additional processing . See also Figure 2 .
When a flying insect crosses the laser beam , its wings partially occlude the light , causing small light fluctuations captured by the phototransistor . This signal is filtered and amplified by a custom designed board , and the output signal is recorded as audio data . In Figure 2 we show a physical version of the device . Note that the sensor is built into standard PVC pipe fittings . This allows us to add a cheap PVC pipe “ portals ” to the hundreds of insectaries found in a typical entomological laboratory , and quickly move the sensor between them .

We omit a detailed discussion of the circuitry and logical design of our sensor , other than to say that we are making the circuit design freely available at [ 14 ] . The entire system can be made for less than $100 , but in bulk , the price can be reduced to less than $10 each . 3 . MOTIVATION FOR INSECT CLASSIFICATION There are at least 3,528 species of mosquitoes [ 11 ] . The majority of these are harmless to humans , but a few dozen species transmits disease agents that cause illness and death among humans while depressing economic well being over large swaths of the globe . Anopheline mosquitoes are vectors ( living carriers of an infectious agent ) of human malaria . Aedine mosquitoes transmit arboviruses such as yellow fever , dengue , and dengue hemorrhagic fever . Culicine mosquitoes are the primary vectors of various diseases , for example human filariasis , western equine encephalomyelitis , St . Louis encephalitis , and West Nile encephalitis . All these diseases have a serious impact on humans , killing one million people , mostly African children , each year .
Despite concerted efforts to control their vectors , most of these mosquito transmitted diseases are spreading [ 16 ] . The first line of defense against vector borne diseases is vector control . Vector control is an umbrella term for any of the dozens of mechanical , chemical , biological methods used to limit or ( locally ) eradicate a pest . Vector control requires constant surveillance of vector populations . Information about a vector ’s spatial and temporal distribution is essential in establishing preventive measures . While vector control is an extremely challenging task , control efforts have shown their value in the eradication of other populations of insects of medical importance . Examples of such successful eradications of a harmful insect species from a large region include that of the New World screwworm , Mediterranean fruit flies , and tsetse flies [ 1 ] . A complete discussion of possible interventions is beyond the scope of this paper [ 16 ] . However current techniques to mitigate mosquitoes deadly effects are myriad , and include : 
The use of insecticidal treated mosquito nets , spraying of insecticides ( including controversial chemicals such as DDT ) ; The introduction of fish/turtles that eat mosquito larva ; The introduction of dragonflies which eat adult mosquitoes ;
   Attracting , then trapping mosquitoes ;  Habitat reduction by draining ponds and pools ;  Use of chemical films to reduce the surface tension of water
( drowning the pupa ) .
The key to vector control is the development of predictors [ 10][15 ] . Establishing early and accurate predictors for mosquito population outbreaks and associated risk of epidemics ideally requires compilation of large data sets from individual agencies encompassing data on mosquito populations , landscape ecology , vertebrate hosts , hospital admissions , and data meteorological data including temperature , humidity and wind speed . Note that most predictors are surrogates1 for the target insect density . For example , meteorological data indirectly tells us of the relative abundance of mosquito breeding grounds , and hospital admission data indirectly and ( belatedly ) tells us of insect density . Our work is motivated by the observation that in this domain surrogate variables are always doomed to be inaccurate and/or tardy . If we want to measure insect density , then we should measure insect density . As we shall show in the next section , plunging prices for sensors , combined with data mining classification techniques now make this possible . 4 . CLASSIFICATION USING WINGBEAT SENSOR DATA In Figure 1 we showed how a simple threshold on the output of our sensor can detect and count insects . However , for the task at hand we need to be able to classify the insect species , and in some cases even the insects sex ( since only female mosquitoes feed on human blood ) . Recall that when deployed in the field , more than 99 % of
1 Surrogate is a variable that can be measured ( or is easy to measure ) that is used in place of one that cannot be measured ( or is difficult to measure ) . in the insects counted may be innocuous or even beneficial . As the reader will have anticipated , we can also use our counting sensor to classify insects . An example of the signal generated by the sensor is presented in Figure 3top This signal was collected from a bee of the species Bombus impatiens ( The Common Eastern Bumble Bee ) in an insectary . A further analysis of the high amplitude section shows the signal has a peak in the fundamental frequency at 197Hz , and some harmonics the fundamental frequency , as shown in Figure 3bottom The first harmonics represents the frequency of interest , ie , the insect wing beat frequency . Whenever possible we do a sanity check to make sure the values returned by our analysis are reasonable . A recent study which measured the wingbeat frequency of this species with a true acoustic device found the frequency had a mean of 181 and a min/max of 155/205 respectively [ 3 ] .

Figure 3 : top ) A one second audio clip recorded by our sensor in insectary containing only Bombus impatiens ( Common Eastern Bumble Bee ) . bottom ) An examination of the amplitude section reveals the fundamental frequency at 197Hz , the wingbeat frequency of the bee it ,
As shown in Figure 3.top the raw digital audio signal can be represented by a sequence S = <s1 , s2 . . . sN> where si is the signal sampled in the instant i and N is the total number of samples of the signal . This sequence contains a lot of acoustic information , and features including ( but not necessarily can be extracted from
. xD> can be generated , where each feature xj is extracted from S ( or some part of it ) by an appropriate extraction procedure , defined as a function Xj : S → Xj , where Xj is the feature domain . From a set of insect species B we must select the most likely class exclusively ) wingbeat frequency . So a feature vector ( cid:1850)(cid:3364 ) = <x1 , x2 . . ( cid:1854)(cid:3552 ) given the data we have observed . More formally , the intuition behind Bayesian classification is to find the most likely ( cid:1854)(cid:3552)(cid:1488)(cid:1828 ) , given the feature vector ( cid:1850)(cid:3364)(cid:1850)(cid:4666)(cid:4667 ) , that is : ( cid:1854)(cid:3552)argmax ( cid:3029)(cid:1488)(cid:3003 ) ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1854)|(cid:1850)(cid:3364)(cid:4667 ) Where ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1854)|(cid:1850)(cid:3364)(cid:4667 ) is the a posteriori probability that the signal by the feature vector ( cid:1850)(cid:3364 ) . Using Bayes rule the equation can be ( cid:3029)(cid:1488)(cid:3003 ) ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1850)(cid:3364)|(cid:1854)(cid:4667)(cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1854)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:1854)(cid:3552)argmax ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1850)(cid:3364)(cid:4667 ) Where ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1850)(cid:3364)|(cid:1854)(cid:4667 ) is the probability of observing the feature vector ( cid:1850)(cid:3364 ) be estimated from frequencies in the database , and ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1850)(cid:3364)(cid:4667 ) is the belongs to a insect of the species b given the features represented in class b , P(b ) is the a priori probability of the species b , that can expressed as : is usually unknown , but if the classifier computes the likelihoods and we can probability of occurrence of the feature vector ( cid:1850)(cid:3364 ) . This probability ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1854)|(cid:1850)(cid:3364)(cid:4667)1 of the entire set of species , then ∑ obtain the desired probabilities for each likely ( cid:1854)(cid:1488)(cid:1828 ) with : ( cid:3029)(cid:1488)(cid:3003 ) ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1854)|(cid:1850)(cid:3364)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1850)(cid:3364)|(cid:1854)(cid:4667)(cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1854)(cid:4667 ) ( cid:1840)(cid:3033 ) ( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1850)(cid:3364)|(cid:1854)(cid:4667)(cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1854)(cid:4667 ) Where Nf = ∑ ( cid:3029)(cid:1488)(cid:3003 )
, and can be understood as a normalization factor . Figure 4 shows a wingbeat frequency distribution plot for seven species of insects . We can use these data to predict the insect species , given the wingbeat frequency . For example , suppose we observe an unknown insect with a wingbeat frequency of 500Hz .

From left to right , Lucidota atra , Chauliognathus marginatus , Oulema melanopus , Drosophila melanogaster , Culex quinquefascitus , Anopheles stephensi , and Aedes aegypti .
We can calculate the insect's class conditioned probability of being Anopheles stephensi using a Gaussian distribution function , given that we know the mean and standard deviation of the Anopheles stephensi wingbeat frequency are 475 and 30 respectively :
( cid:1842)(cid:4666)(cid:1875)(cid:1861)(cid:1859)(cid:1854)(cid:1857)(cid:1853)500|(cid:1827)(cid:1867)(cid:1868)(cid:1860)(cid:1857)(cid:1864)(cid:1857)(cid:4667 )

We can calculate the probabilities for the other classes in a similar manner , and predict our unknown insect as the most likely class . In this example , the unknown insect is about 3.3 times more likely to be an Anopheles than Aedes aegypti ( the second most likely class ) . Figure 5 is a plot of the wing beat frequency histogram for three species captured with our sensor .
Figure 5 : Histogram of one second fragments for three species : Bumble impatiens , Culex quinquefasciatu and Aedes Aegypti From Figure 5 we can observe that the distribution for all classes resembles a Gaussian distribution with a long left tail . The Bumblebees wing beats frequencies are linearly separable from insects usually present the the mosquitoes frequencies , an expected result since Bumblebees are considerably larger than the mosquitoes , and larger lower wingbeat frequencies . Considering the wingbeat frequencies of the mosquitoes alone , Aedes aegypti has higher frequency wingbeats than Culex quinquefasciatu ; however , there is some overlap between the wingbeat frequencies distribution of these two species . We can use a very simple Bayesian classifier , as discussed above , to categorize the examples into the three classes ( species ) . We assume each class distribution is governed by a Gaussian distribution , with mean and standard deviation , as well as class prior probabilities , P(b ) . We applied this simple Bayesian classifier to the data and obtained a respectful 96.04 % accuracy . The results for each class are summarized in Table 1 .

100.00 % 97.34 % 89.92 % Note that the histogram for Culex quinquefasciatu in Figure 5 does not appear to be well modeled by a single Gaussian . This is not unexpected ; Culex quinquefasciatu , like many mosquitoes , is highly sexually dimorphic , the females are larger than the males , and thus have lower wingbeat frequencies . In fact , the data in Figure 5 is suggestive of one Gaussian bump at about 400Hz and another at 550Hz . Ideally we would record training data for each sex separately , however sexing mosquitoes , either as larva or adults is very difficult [ 7 ] . We plan to investigate techniques to mitigate this by learning a mixture model for the insects [ 6 ] . 5 . COMPUTATIONAL ENTOMOLOGY IS A DATA MINING PROBLEM We end with a brief discussion as to why the insect classification problem addressed here , and more general computational entomology problems , should be consider a sub field of data mining . We begin by noting the scale of the data considered . A single experiment we did on one species produced more than 200,000 data events . We need to reproduce this experiment at several different times of the year , and at several different latitudes , for at least one hundred different insect species . We conservatively estimate that we will produce a billion data events in the next year alone . Furthermore , our insect classification problem requires contributions from virtually every data mining technique . For example , we use outlier detection to throw out spurious events in our audio data , we can use regression to predict how the wingbeat frequency of an insect will generalize to new temperatures and altitudes , in the ( current ) absence of circadian rhythms for all target insects we are using transfer learning to fill in missing data [ 4 ] by transferring information from an insect in the same genus etc . Finally , when deploy our sensors in the field , the insect density data we obtain can be used as inputs into several higher level data mining algorithms , including spatiotemporal analyses [ 1 ] and association ( rule ) discovery . For example , while it has long been known that there is an association between precipitation and mosquito density , the exact nature of this association is still not understood [ 9 ] . We have long been able to get minute by minute precipitation data for most of the world , but similarly fine grained data on insect density has not been available until now . 6 .
