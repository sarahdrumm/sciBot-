INTRODUCTION
As the use of mobile devices increases , a location based service ( LBS ) becomes increasingly popular because it provides more convenient context aware services . However , LBS introduces problematic issues for location privacy due to the nature of the service . Location privacy protection methods based on k anonymity and ℓdiversity have been proposed to provide anonymized use of LBS . However , the k anonymity and ℓ diversity methods still can endanger the user ’s privacy because location semantic information could easily be breached while using LBS . This paper presents a novel location privacy protection technique , which protects the location semantics from an adversary . In our scheme , location semantics are first learned from location data . Then , the trustedanonymization server performs the anonymization using the location semantic information by cloaking with semantically heterogeneous locations . Thus , the location semantic information is kept secure as the cloaking is done with semantically heterogeneous locations and the true location information is not delivered to the LBS applications . This paper proposes algorithms for learning location semantics and achieving semantically secure cloaking .

The use of mobile devices has increased dramatically in the last decade . As mobile device technology has developed , context awareness services have become available and mobile devices now support more convenient and user friendly services . The representative service of context awareness services is a location based service ( LBS ) . LBS is an information and entertainment service based on the geographical position of the mobile device . There are many different kinds of LBS services , such as navigation services , requesting the nearest business locations , receiving traffic alerts or notifications , and so on .
However , LBS services introduce problematic issues for location privacy due to the nature of the service . The history of certain user ’s locations could be accumulated , and private information could be exposed if an adversary has access to that history . For example , support for a certain political party , or the whereabouts of a user at a certain time could be handed to adversaries and abused by them . This is a critical problem because most people are reluctant to use LBS services if their location privacy is in danger in spite of its convenience .
In order to protect location privacy , previous research has been done using k anonymity [ 23 ] and ℓ diversity [ 19 ] . A cloaking area , which is an extended area from the exact position of a mobile user , is computed by the anonymization server and the anonymization server delegates the LBS requests for a mobile user . For computing a cloaking area , k anonymity based location privacy [ 10 , 6 , 20 , 3 , 14 , 26 , 27 ] extends a cloaking area until ‘k 1’ other users are included , and ℓ diversity based location privacy [ 1 , 24 , 28 ] extends until ‘ℓ 1’ different locations are included . As a result , an exact position is abstracted with other users ( k anonymity ) and other locations ( ℓ diversity ) , which makes it difficult for an adversary to infer valuable information ( see Section 7 for related work ) .
Although these previous methods guarantee some degree of location privacy , both techniques have a critical limitation . The cloaking area could breach location semantic information , which possibly endangers the user ’s privacy . To be specific , the cloaking area could include only semantically similar locations even if it is mixed with other users and locations , and the adversary would be able to infer semantic meanings from the extended area . For example , if the extended area only includes an elementary school , high school , and university , then the adversary could infer that a mobile user is doing work related to ‘teaching’ or ‘studying’ .
In this paper , we propose a novel location privacy protection technique , which protects the location semantics from an adversary . In our scheme , location semantics are first learned from location data . Then , the trusted anonymization server performs the anonymization using the location semantic information by cloaking with semantically heterogeneous locations . Thus , the location
1289 semantic information is kept secure as the cloaking is done with semantically heterogeneous locations and the true location information is not delivered to the LBS applications .
Our primary novel contributions are summarized as follows .
1 . exact position
2 . cloaking area
4 . filtered results
3 . area results
• We propose a method for mining location semantics from the perspective of location privacy . A staying duration feature is presented to capture the location semantics from trajectory data , and such mined location semantics are stored in an abstracted graph to be efficiently used .
• We propose a method to obtain a cloaking area which protects location semantic leakages . An adversary ’s prior and posterior knowledge of location semantics is generally modeled and the adversary ’s information gain from a cloaking area is restricted below a certain degree . According to the experimental results , our method is much safer at the same cost than k anonymity and ℓ diversity based location privacy methods in terms of a semantic heterogeneity .
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows . Section 2 introduces the background of location privacy protection and points out its limitations . Section 3 describes how to obtain location semantic information and Section 4 presents how to compute an extended area with semantically heterogeneous locations . Section 5 shows the evaluation results of our proposed methods . Section 6 discusses the limitations and future work of our method , and Section 7 surveys related work . Section 8 concludes the paper .
2 . BACKGROUND AND LIMITATIONS
Many researchers have tried to guarantee location privacy in using LBS , but their attempts have limitations . In this section , we first give the background of location privacy protection techniques and then describe the limitations of such techniques .
2.1 Background : Location Privacy Protection A primary cause of location privacy breaches in using LBS lies in the fact that the exact position of a mobile device should be used and known to LBS applications . Thus , in order to protect exact position information , location privacy protection techniques use a cloaking area instead of exact position information for LBS requests . A cloaking area is defined as an area which includes the current position of a mobile device for the purpose of hiding an exact position . Based on using a cloaking area , the adversary cannot easily breach a mobile user ’s privacy since the exact current position is abstracted . There are largely two approaches for computing the cloaking area , each of which is based on well known data publishing protection techniques , k anonymity [ 23 ] and ℓ diversity [ 19 ] . Depending on which technique has been adopted for location privacy , we refer to as location k anonymity or location ℓ diversity .
The most well known approach is location k anonymity [ 10 , 6 , 20 , 3 , 14 , 26 , 27 ] , which provides at least a ‘k’ anonymity level . In location k anonymity , the cloaking area is extended until ‘k 1’ other users are included . This is a good starting point for protecting location privacy because the adversary has to classify each person among ‘k’ people to identify who actually submitted LBS requests . Similar to k anonymity , location ℓ diversity [ 1 , 18 , 24 , 28 ] extends a cloaking area until ‘ℓ 1’ different locations are included . In location ℓ diversity , the adversary cannot simply tell which location a mobile user actually visited since the cloaking area includes multiple locations .
These location k anonymity and ℓ diversity techniques are performed by a trusted anonymization server for a mobile device and

Figure 2 : An example of a location similarity attack against a cloaking area we call this model a trusted anonymization server based model hereafter . Figure 1 shows a trusted anonymization server based model . At first , a mobile user requests a service to the trustedanonymization server ( line 1 ) . In this request , the mobile user specifies her exact current position . Then the anonymization server computes the cloaking area using either a number of users ( location k anonymity ) or locations ( location ℓ diversity ) nearby the user ’s position . The cloaking area is passed to LBS applications ( line 2 ) and the LBS applications return all results related to the cloaking area ( line 3 ) . The anonymization server filters out unnecessary results and gives back the result corresponding to the mobile user ’s current location ( line 4 ) .
As a result , the exact position is not exposed to LBS applications because a cloaking area is used instead of the position . Though the delegating anonymization server knows the exact position of a mobile device , LBS applications only see an abstracted range of an area .
2.2 Limitations of Previous Location Privacy
Protection
Though location k anonymity and ℓ diversity approaches guarantee some degree of location privacy , both protection schemes are vulnerable to a location similarity attack which possibly endangers LBS user ’s privacy . In other words , a cloaking area CA , which contains n locations denoted as L(CA ) = {S1 , S2 , , Sn} , is vulnerable to a location similarity attack if all locations in CA are semantically similar .
Figure 2 shows an example of a location similarity attack . Assume that each node from S1 to S3 represents a location ; S1 and S2 are hospitals and S3 is a library . Note that ‘x’ marked in the center represents the current location of a mobile user . Based on this setting , two rectangles , CAk and CAℓ , represent the cloaking area under k anonymity ( k = 5 ) and ℓ diversity ( ℓ = 2 ) respectively . CAk in Figure 2 (a ) is vulnerable to a location similarity attack since it only includes a single location , S1 . Thus , the mobile user using the cloaking area CAk for LBS requests would be highly linked to hospitals and can be suspected of having treatment . CAℓ
1290 in Figure 2 (b ) is also vulnerable because two locations in CAℓ are similar in terms of the purpose of its visits . Similarly , a mobile user using CAℓ would be suspected for the same reason .
What we actually desire would be to have a cloaking area with semantically heterogeneous locations , which needs to include S3 in the above example . However , both location k anonymity and ℓ diversity methods fail to protect a mobile user from a location similarity attack . Location k anonymity fails because it picks the users without considering their locations and location l diversity fails because it picks the locations without considering the semantics of locations .
3 . MINING LOCATION SEMANTICS
In order to compute secure cloaking area based on location semantics , we must be aware of location semantics beforehand . In this paper , location semantics are interpreted as which type of services are provided at locations . This interpretation makes sense from the perspective of location privacy , because what people want to secure in location privacy is what they did in a location .
Based on such an interpretation , this section describes how to obtain location semantics . Locations are identified first ( Section 3.1 ) and features for capturing location semantics are proposed next ( Section 32 ) Finally , a location semantic graph which represents semantic relations between locations is constructed ( Section 33 ) The location semantic graph will be used to compute the cloaking area with semantically heterogeneous locations ( Section 4 ) .
3.1 Identifying Locations
There are several methods for finding a location . The first one is to utilize point of interest ( POI ) collections , which can be publicly available through OpenStreetMap [ 11 ] , etc . Since POI collections provide information on locations that people may find useful or interesting , locations including coordinate information can be obtained . The second method , which we use in our experiments , is to analyze trajectory data . The trajectory data contains coordinate information ( usually GPS points ) and corresponding timestamps . If a trajectory stays in a limited area over a time threshold value , it indicates that someone stayed in that location and did some meaningful job . Thus , locations can be discovered by identifying such a limited area . For interested readers , please refer to [ 31 ] for more details .
3.2 Features for Location Semantics
Our proposed method for discovering location semantics is based on the following observations . People visit locations mostly with a reason . We go to restaurants to have food , schools to attend classes , or hospitals to see a doctor . Since we have reasons for a visit , we stay for a while in a location for those reasons . Moreover , we spend a different amount of time depending on these reasons . Motivated by these observations , we propose two quantitative features for extracting location semantics , which are named staying duration , and usage time context .
Staying duration : People spend different amount of time in a location depending on what they do there . We call this amount of time staying duration . Intuitively , having food in a restaurant generally takes one or two hours , whereas students usually stay more than six hours at school . In addition , restaurants themselves have different staying duration distributions according to what they actually serve . For example , eating at a fine dining restaurant takes much longer time than at a fastfood restaurant . Thus visiting purposes of each location can be captured by using the staying duration .

Figure 3 : PDF of features for location semantics
Usage time context : It is common to see that places have their own active ( popular ) times . For example , most restaurants are full of customers during lunch or dinner time . On the contrary , most bars are full during the night but quiet in the morning . Relying on common sense , locations have differences in the distribution of usage times depending on services provided .
The feature data can be acquired via trajectory or survey data which contains such information . From the data , each feature ’s distribution is computed for each location . For example , hypothetical distributions of each feature are plotted in Figure 3 . Distributions for locations such as school , fastfood restaurant , and cafe , are represented according to each location ’s characteristics . In Figure 3 (a ) , the x axis represents staying duration and it reflects the fact that people stay longer at school than a fastfood restaurant or cafe . In Figure 3 (b ) , the x axis represents usage time . A fastfood restaurant and cafe are crowded during meal times , but a school is active throughout the daytime .
Though the two features mentioned above can be used to characterize semantics of locations , we choose to use staying duration in our experiments . This is because the usage time context does not capture location semantics in some cases . For instance , a cafeteria and a dining restaurant are difficult to distinguish based on the usage time context because both places have similar crowded times . However , the staying duration feature is able to distinguish such places well because most people spend more time in a dining restaurant than in a cafeteria .
3.3 Constructing Location Semantic Graph
In order to represent location semantics with a simplified data structure , we present a location semantic graph . A distance between places ( edge weight ) is computed first and a cluster of locations ( node ) are determined next . Finally , a location semantic graph is built with edges and nodes .
331 Distance measure
The distance measure should be able to capture the semantic differences between locations . Since all features can be represented in distributions , Kullback Leibler ( KL ) divergence could be a reasonable choice to measure the distances between two distributions . KL divergence measures the distances of two distributions P , Q with
DKL(P ||Q ) = Z ∞
−∞ p(x ) logfl p(x ) q(x ) dx .
However , KL divergence is not an appropriate measure to capture semantic differences , which is explained in the following example . Figure 4 shows three staying duration distributions P , Q , and R . Intuitively , P is similar to Q than to R . That is , our desired result

Time
Figure 4 : Example of staying duration distribution is D(P ||Q ) < D(P ||R ) . However , the actual result from KL divergence is DKL(P ||Q ) ≈ DKL(P ||R ) because KL divergence cannot capture that the semantic distance between 1 hour and 9 hours is bigger than that between 1 hour and 3 hours is .
In order to overcome this limitation of KL divergence , we use Earth Mover ’s Distance which has recently been adopted for privacy protection of publishing data [ 15 ] . Earth Mover ’s Distance ( EMD):1 A distribution can be interpreted as an arbitrary arrangement of a mass of particles . In this view , a distribution can be transformed to another distribution by moving particles . EMD captures the minimum costs of transporting particles to equalize two distributions , which can be formally defined using the transportation problem . Suppose P and Q can be represented P = {p1 , p2 , . . . , pm} , Q = {q1 , q2 , . . . , qm} . The workload , needed to make two distribution the same , is defined as follows .
WORK(P , Q , F ) = m m
Xi=1
Xj=1 fij dij with constraints fij ≥ 0 ,
1 ≤ i , j ≤ m , pi − m
Xj=1 fij + m
Xi=1 fij = qi , m m
Xi=1
Xj=1 fij = m
Xi=1 pi = m
Xj=1 qj = 1 , where fij is a flow of mass ( the amount of moving particles ) from i to j , dij is a ground distance from i to j , and all flows F = [ fij ] . From this setting , EMD measures the minimum workload , defined as
DEMD ( P , Q ) = min
F
WORK(P , Q , F ) .
The virtue of EMD is in adjusting ground distance which enables us to capture semantic differences . In our case , the ground distance ( dij ) is set to be the normalized difference between staying durations , ie , the difference of staying duration divided by the maximum difference . Thus , 0 ≤ dij ≤ 1 for all i and j , which results in 0 ≤ DEMD ( P , Q ) ≤ 1 [ 15 ] . When revisiting the example in Figure 4 , EMD performs DEMD ( P , Q ) < DEMD ( P , R ) as desired since EMD sees ( 1 hour , 3 hours ) pair has a much smaller ground distance than ( 1 hour , 9 hours ) pair has . As a result , EMD is a better distance measure than KL divergence for our application and we adopt EMD as the distance measure for location semantic differences .
332 Location clustering
Based on EMD , locations are grouped into clusters before being structured in a graph . The main reason for performing clustering is that the data which would represent location semantics across all
1We do not present a detailed description of EMD . Interested readers please refer to [ 22 , 15 ] . locations is too complicated and huge . Because there are numerous locations which are bases of people activities , computational complexities and exchanging costs with such data would be considerable burdens .
In this respect , k means clustering is performed by grouping semantically similar locations . Pair wise distances between locations are represented using EMD and the centroid of each cluster is updated by computing the average of the distributions in the cluster . Detailed explanations for k means clustering can be found in [ 12 ] .
333 Location semantic graph
After having clustered locations , all semantic information is represented by a graph based structure , which we call a location semantic graph . In a location semantic graph , a node represents clustered locations and an edge weight represents EMD between corresponding nodes . EMD between cluster nodes is defined as
D(Ci , Cj ) = Xli∈Ci
1
|Ci| Xlj ∈Cj
DEMD ( li , lj )
|Cj| where Ci , Cj are clusters , |Ci| , |Cj| are the number of locations in a cluster , and li , lj are the distributions of each location . Note that D(Ci , Cj ) is also normalized into [ 0,1 ] because 0 ≤ DEMD ( li , lj ) ≤ 1 for all i , j .
Figure 5 shows an example of a location semantic graph . The nodes indicate clustered locations , each of which is a group of semantically similar locations . The edge weight indicates the semantic differences between clusters computed by EMD . The number beside the cluster is the normalized number of locations in the cluster . Since all clusters have one location respectively , all clusters are 025

θ SECURE CLOAKING AREA
Obtaining a privacy preserving cloaking area is difficult because the way of checking the safety of the cloaking area in terms of location semantics is unexplored . In other words , it is difficult to evaluate how much location semantic information an adversary will gain from the cloaking area . To handle this , we propose methods for evaluating the safety of cloaking areas ( Section 4.1 ) and obtaining a θ secure cloaking area ( Section 42 )
4.1 Computing EMD of Cloaking Area
An adversary gains location semantic information from a cloaking area only if it is different from what he/she already knew . In other words , before seeing the cloaking area , the adversary ’s knowledge is the location semantics of an entire area since he/she has no idea where a mobile user is located ( a prior belief ) . After seeing the cloaking area , the adversary obtains more specific location semantics corresponding to the cloaking area ( a posterior belief ) . Thus , the information gain of the adversary from the cloaking area can be the difference between such prior beliefs and posterior beliefs , which is directly linked to the safety of the cloaking area . Motivated by this observation , we aim at evaluating the differences of the prior belief and the posterior belief .
The prior belief is the location semantic information of an arbitrary area since the adversary has no idea where a mobile user is located . Thus , the prior belief is represented as a location semantic graph in a hypothetically large area . For the posterior belief , the adversary sees a cloaking area which possibly contains more specific semantic information . Thus , the posterior belief is a more elaborated location semantic graph which is built upon the prior belief .

Figure 6 : A spatial snapshot of a mobile user and its location semantic graph
Figure 6 illustrates a spatial snapshot of a mobile user ( a ) and its location semantic graph ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) . Note that the location semantic graph in Figure 5 is constructed based on Figure 6 (a ) to be a running example . In Figure 6 , locations from S1 to S4 are represented with their corresponding cluster labels . A mobile user located at ‘x’ marked in the center has two choices for the cloaking area , CA1 and CA2 . The cluster weight of the location semantic graph in ( b1 ) and ( b2 ) is changed because it only considers the cloaking area . For example , ( b1 ) shows 0.5 on C1 , C3 , and 0 on C2 , C4 , because C1 , C3 have one location respectively but C2 , C4 have no location .
To measure the safety of a cloaking area by comparing the prior belief and the posterior belief , we compute the EMD of location semantic graphs between before and after seeing the cloaking area . A node ( clustered locations ) in a location semantic graph is converted into a discrete domain in EMD , and an edge weight ( semantic differences ) is converted into a ground distance dij . Numerical computational results of CA1 and CA2 are shown below as DEMD ( PCA1 , PE ) and DEMD ( PCA2 , PE ) respectively .

DEMD ( PCA2 , PE ) = min f Xi Xj fij dij = 0.075 where PCAk indicates the posterior belief of cloaking area CAk , PE indicates the prior belief . dij and fij is a ground distance and a flow between clusters Ci and Cj respectively , and f ∗ ij is an optimal flow making two beliefs the same ( see Section 6 for the discussion on the time complexity of EMD computations ) . Note that 0 ≤ DEMD ( PCA , PE ) ≤ 1 is satisfied , because 0 ≤ dij = D(Ci , Cj ) ≤ 1 holds .
Based on DEMD ( PCA2 , PE ) < DEMD ( PCA1 , PE ) , we argue that CA2 is more secure than CA1 . This interpretation makes sense since C1 and C2 have bigger semantic distances than C1 and C3 have .
4.2 Finding θ Secure Cloaking Area
Based on the safety measure of the cloaking area , a θ secure cloaking area is defined below .
Definition 1 . θ Secure Cloaking Area . If a cloaking area CA satisfies DEMD ( PCA , PE ) ≤ θ , we denote this cloaking area as a θ secure cloaking area .
In order to obtain a θ secure cloaking area , a cloaking area is extended until it satisfies θ secure cloaking area . Algorithm 1 describes a greedy algorithm for finding a θ secure cloaking area .
Note that all locations are mapped onto a 2n by 2n grid for efficient computation ( n is selected by the user ) .

In Algorithm 1 , a single cell , which includes a current mobile position , is chosen as an initial cloaking area ( line 1 ) . Next , obtain possible directions from {North , East , South , West} , which would make a rectangular form of a cloaking area ( line 2 ) . For each direction , the cloaking area is extended ( line 4 ) , and a posterior belief and EMD are computed ( line 5 6 ) . After iterating over all possible directions , select a cloaking area which has the minimum EMD value ( line 7 8 ) . Finally , if the minimum EMD value is less than the threshold θ ( line 9 ) , then return the corresponding cloaking area which is a θ secure cloaking area ( line 11 ) .
5 . EVALUATION
5.1 Experimental Setting
We extended a traffic simulator [ 2 ] to consider the human mobility patterns , which enables us to evaluate the effectiveness and performance of our proposed methods.2 As described in Section 3 , people stay a while in a location according to the location semantics . To be able to reflect such characteristics , the simulator should be able to determine the staying duration of each location . However , to the best of our knowledge , all known traffic simulators do not consider location semantics but simply generate random

β Nusers 4000 10 movements . Thus , we modify the state of the art traffic simulator , Network based Generator of Moving Objects [ 2 ] , in order to reflect realistic human movement patterns .
In our modified simulator , staying duration patterns are modeled relying on the Gaussian distribution with latent variables . First , we sample Nc clusters which represent the group of semantically similar locations . For a cluster Ck , the mean µck and the standard deviation σck of the cluster staying duration pattern are picked from the uniform distributions , µck ∼ U(tmin , tmax ) and σck ∼ U(0 , α ) , where tmax and tmin represent the maximum and minimum staying duration and α controls the variance of the cluster . Next , Nl locations are sampled from the clusters . For a location lki from the cluster Ck , the mean µlki and the standard deviation σlki of a location staying duration pattern are picked from the Gaussian distributions , µlki ∼ N ( µck , β ) and σlki ∼ N ( σck , β ) , where β controls the variance among the locations in each cluster . Once a moving object reaches the location , an actual staying duration t is determined from the Gaussian distribution t ∼ N ( µlki , σlki ) . In addition , a moving object chooses its next destination based on a lévy flight process that is known to be followed by human mobility patterns according to a recent study [ 9 ] . Relying on the lévy flight process , the probability of visiting nearby locations is higher than those of far away locations .
We generated trajectory data using our modified simulator . Nusers objects were moved over a real road map of Oldenburg , Germany . The road map contains 6,105 nodes and 7,035 edges , a city about 15×15 km2 , which is presented in a 27 by 27 grid . Table 1 lists the parameters used for simulating moving objects . It is assumed that a LBS request is sent with a 2 % probability from the reported positions . A staying duration pattern for each location is obtained from the trajectory and a location semantic graph is learned from the staying duration patterns . Using the location semantic graph , a θ secure cloaking area is computed for each LBS request . In order to compare with the proposed method , a cloaking area is also computed based on k anonymity and ℓ diversity techniques as described in Section 21
5.2 Experimental Results
521 Evaluation on location semantic learning
From 2000 locations used for generating trajectory data , 1948 locations were identified . Some locations were missing because a small number of moving objects passed by them . Among the identified locations , k means clustering was performed with a parameter k = 4 , and the clustering result was close to the perfect ; ie F1 = 0997 In order to measure the correctness of the location semantic graph , we measured the normalized edge weight differences between the modeled location semantic graph ( GM ) and learned location semantic graph ( GL ) as
D(GM , GL ) =

, where NC denote the number of clusters , and AM and AL denote the weighted adjacency matrix of GM and GL respectively . Since the edge weight is normalized into [ 0,1 ] , the minimum and maximum of D(GM , GL ) are 0 and 1 . Moreover , to evaluate the goodness of D(GM , GL ) , we randomly created the location semantic graph GR and the average is obtained from 30 times of running D(GM , GR ) . From the experiments , we obtained D(GM , GL ) = 0.084 and D(GM , GR ) = 0.281 , which shows much closer results to the modeled location semantic graph .
522 Evaluation on θ secure cloaking area
Attack models and measures : The adversary is assumed to have location semantic information at best , eg the location semantic graph of the model used for generating the trajectory . Consequently , the adversary takes a better position than our method because our method uses the learned location semantic graph which slightly deviates from the actual location semantic graph .
First of all , we checked how much location semantic information the adversary would gain from a cloaking area , which is quantified in EMD of a cloaking area . Since the adversary and our method have a different location semantic graph , EMD computed from the same cloaking area would be different . This implies that the θcloaking area returned by our algorithm may not guarantee θ degree of protection from the adversary ’s view . To be clear , we denote θt as a threshold for computing a cloaking area in our algorithm while θa is the EMD from the adversary ’s view .
To evaluate resistance against a location similarity attack launched by the adversary , we measure the number of θa insecure cloaking areas . A θa insecure cloaking area is a cloaking area which has EMD higher than θa from the adversary ’s point of view . It implies that the adversary would gain θa degree or more of location semantics information from the corresponding cloaking area .
The cost of using a cloaking area is measured by the size of the cloaking area . Since a mobile user uses the cloaking area for the anonymization , he/she needs to spend more network traffic and computing costs proportional to the size of the cloaking area .

Figure 11 : EMD of all cloaking areas by varying k , ℓ , and θt
Safety of a θ secure cloaking area : Figure 7 shows the cumulative distribution function ( CDF ) of all 4000 cloaking areas’ EMD for θt = 005 When EMD is computed from our algorithm ( method ’s view ) , 90 % of the cloaking areas’ EMD is below 0.05 , which implies that our algorithm successfully returns θt secure cloaking area in most cases . Some cloaking area ’s EMD is over 0.05 because our algorithm failed to find θt secure cloaking area under the given number of extending steps . When it comes to the adversary ’s view , it shows slightly higher EMD value than the method ’s view . Although computed EMD is different , EMD of most cloaking areas is below 0.06 from the adversary ’s view , which is close to the model ’s view .
Figure 8 shows the number of θa insecure cloaking areas while changing θt . Overall , as θt increases the number of insecure cloaking areas also increases , because a lower privacy level is enforced for higher θt . In addition , an actual θa degree of anonymity is obtained when θt < θa . For example , in 0.08 insecure case ( θa = 0.08 ) , there are about 3000 insecure cloaking areas when θt = 0.08 , but fewer than 450 insecure cloaking areas when θt ≤ 006 Since this difference between θt and θa is a relative difference between the model ’s view and the adversary ’s view , we believe this does not indicate a weakness in our method . To achieve θa degree of anonymity , a smaller θt can be used , eg using θt=0.06 to achieve θa=0.08 degree of anonymity in this case .
Cost of a θ secure cloaking area : Figure 9 shows the average size of the cloaking area versus θt . As θt decreases the average size of a cloaking area increases because a small θt implies more strict anonymization degree and causes a larger cloaking area . In addition , the curve follows a negative exponential function , which can be interpreted as follows . As θt approaches 1 ( no location privacy guarantee ) , the average size would approach zero ( the size of an exact position ) . On the contrary , as θt approaches zero ( the maxi mum location privacy guarantee ) , the average size would approach infinity ( the size of the maximum area ) .
Comparison with k anonymity and ℓ diversity : The safety and the costs of our method are compared with baseline methods , location k anonymity and ℓ diversity . 4000 requests are anonymized with our method as well as with baseline methods while changing the parameter of each method ’s privacy requirement ( k , l , and θt ) . Figure 10 plots the number of θa insecure cloaking areas with the average size of cloaking areas for each parameter setting . In most cases , our method shows a lower number of θa insecure the cloaking areas when the average size of cloaking area is similar to the others . For example , in Figure 10 (c ) , when k = 43 , l = 18 , and θt = 0.02 , the number of insecure cloaking areas of θt is much lower than k and ℓ . This signifies that our method provides better safety when the costs for enforcing the location privacy are the same .
Moreover , our method also shows better performances in costs when the provided safety is the same . To be specific , when the number of θa insecure cloaking areas are the same , our method has a lower average size of cloaking areas than the others . Such superiority of our method becomes clearer as a safety requirement gets strict . In other words , as the criteria for insecure cloaking areas ( θa ) decreases , the gap between our method ( θt ) and baseline methods ( k and ℓ ) remarkably increases as shown from Figure 10 (a ) to Figure 10 (c ) . Thus , a mobile user would get more benefits if location privacy preservation is the primary need .
In order to investigate more details , Figure 11 shows CDF of EMD of all cloaking areas when the costs , the average size of cloaking areas , are similar , eg ( k=16 , ℓ=7 , θt=0.05 ) and ( k=43 , ℓ=18 , θt=002 ) In both cases , θt is always more concentrated to lower EMD than k and l , which implies that our method guarantees better protection of the location semantics against any level of a location similarity attack .
Figure 12 illustrates the two dimensional distribution of each cloaking area ’s size and its EMD , when the costs are similar . Overall , the distribution of the cloaking area from our method is concentrated in the bottom but the distributions from baseline methods are dispersed upward , which indicates that our method provides better location semantic protection at the same costs . Moreover , the brightest cell in Figure 12 (b3 ) is located more left than in Figure 12 (b1 ) and ( b2 ) . As a result , a large portion of the cloaking area in our method has a smaller size . However , since the average size of the cloaking area in these three figures is similar , some cloaking areas of our method would have a bigger size . This suggests that a mobile user using our method would enjoy low costs in most cases , but in some cases would pay relatively high costs .

6 . DISCUSSION
Most previous work guarantees the anonymity and unlinkability based on k anonymity and ℓ diversity . Since our work focuses on protecting the location semantics using θ secure cloaking area , the anonymity and unlinkability could be unprotected in some cases . For resolving this issue , all three parameters , θ secure cloaking area , k anonymity , and ℓ diversity , could be used together , similarly PrivacyGrid [ 1 ] uses k anonymity and ℓ diversity together . In addition , since our method does not have reciprocity [ 14 ] , θ secure cloaking area may reveal the user location information caused by outliers ; ie in peripheral areas where there are few semantically related locations , the cloaking area can become quite large and reveal that the user is in that peripheral area . To satisfy the reciprocity property , HilbertCloak [ 14 ] algorithm could be used .
Furthermore , our method relies on an EMD computation both in an offline step ( clustering semantic locations ) and an online step ( computing a θ secure cloaking area ) . Thus , it is vital for our method to be able to efficiently compute EMD , especially in the online stage . The time complexity for computing EMD can be formalized using a minimum cost network problem , and it can be solved in O(n3 log n ) [ 22 ] , where n is either the number of locations or clusters in our method . Because the number of clusters would be quite small , we believe this is not the serious load for the online stage . For the offline stage , approximation algorithms can be adopted , which empirically lead to O(n ) or O(n2 log n ) [ 17 , 21 ] with error bounds . Note that each approximation algorithm requires a specific setting for the ground distance ; ie L1 distances [ 17 ] or thresholded distances [ 21 ] . Since the ground distance in our method is on the non euclidean space , more investigations should be done to adopt approximation algorithms .
7 . RELATED WORK
Anonymization for publishing relational database : In order to protect published relational database data such as medical data , kanonymity [ 23 ] was developed . k anonymity guarantees the adversary cannot distinguish an individual record from at least ‘k 1’ other tuples . However , since ‘k 1’ other tuples may be the same sensitive values , ℓ diversity [ 19 ] was proposed which enforces tuples in the same group have at least ‘ℓ 1’ diverse sensitive values .
Ninghui et al . proposed t closeness [ 15 ] to resolve the semantic breaches of k anonymity and ℓ diversity . t closeness guarantees tuples in the same group are statistically similar to the entire data using EMD .
Anonymization for location based services : Gruteser et al . first proposed location privacy technique based on the k anonymity concept and trusted anonymization server [ 10 ] . The cloaking area , which is extended until ‘k 1’ other users are included , is computed through a trusted anonymization server and used for LBS requests instead of exact coordinates . A series of work has improved the computation of a cloaking area under k anonymity . CliqueCloak [ 6 ] and Casper [ 20 ] proposed personalized location anonymization . CliqueCloak locates a clique in a graph to compute the cloaking area and Casper uses a quadtree based pyramid data structure for fast computation of the cloaking area . Probabilistic Cloaking [ 3 ] proposed imprecise LBS requests which yield probabilistic results . The HilbertCloak [ 14 ] algorithm utilizes Hilbert spacefilling curve and its cloaking area is independent of mobile user distribution . To reduce the size of the cloaking area , historical locations of mobile nodes are used for computing the cloaking area instead of the current mobile node ’s location [ 26 ] . Feeling based location privacy [ 27 ] sets ‘k’ using the location where a mobile user feels safe enough to disclose her location .
Using the k anonymity based technique , the cloaking area may include only one meaningful location ( eg a specific hospital or school ) and disclose strong relationships to such a location . Thus , PrivacyGrid [ 1 ] proposed location ℓ diversity , which extends the cloaking area until ‘ℓ 1’ different locations are included . PrivacyGrid used both location k anonymity and ℓ diversity so that the anonymization into different persons and locations can be done together . Similarly , XSTAR [ 24 ] attempted to achieve the optimal balance between high query processing efficiency and robust inferenceattack resilience while considering k anonymity and ℓ diversity together . Several works [ 28 , 25 , 5 ] have identified semantic breach issues , but impractical assumptions were made to resolve such issues . Location diversity [ 28 ] assumed that location semantics are prelabeled and ℓ diversity is able to protect the semantic breaches , and PROBE [ 5 ] also assumed the pre labeled location semantics and requires many profile parameters for each user . p sensitivity [ 25 ] assumed that a LBS request is classified into a sensitive or insensitive request .
In architectural perspectives , previous location privacy protection schemes mostly follow the trusted server based model in which an anonymization server delegates all LBS requests for mobile users . However , SpaceTwist [ 29 ] proposes an client based model which uses a fake location instead of using ‘exact location’ for computing a cloaking area . [ 7 ] also proposes the client based model based on Private Information Retrieval ( PIR ) with cryptographic techniques . The peer to peer model [ 4 , 8 , 13 ] attempts to remove trusted anonymization server . Based on a decentralized cooperative peer to peer model , location information among nearby peers is shared and used for computing the cloaking area .
Location data mining : A recommending system for travelers is proposed in [ 31 , 30 ] . Trajectory data is analyzed and interesting locations are mined based on visited frequencies on each location . In [ 16 ] , a similarity between users is mined based on the sequence property of people ’s movement behaviors , which also enables to identify correlations among locations . To the best of our knowledge , our research is the first to discover location semantics using staying duration and utilize it for computing semantically heterogeneous cloaking areas .
1296 8 . CONCLUSION
This paper proposes novel location privacy protecting techniques . Our proposed methods protect the location semantics from the LBS applications by performing the cloaking with semantically heterogeneous locations . Experimental results validate our proposed methods .
