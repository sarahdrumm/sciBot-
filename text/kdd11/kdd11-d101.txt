INTRODUCTION
Evaluation of object importance or popularity is an important research problem in information retrieval that can assist in many data mining tasks , eg , ranking query results of search engines , extracting communities in social networks and studying evolution of communities in dynamic networks . In the literature , there are many approaches to evaluating object importance [ 9 , 3 , 15 , 12 , 19 , 8 ] . In these relation analysis methods , a single relation type is focused and studied . For example , both PageRank [ 19 ] and HITS [ 12 ] consider the structure of web , decompose and study the adjacency matrix that representing the hyperlink structure .
In this paper , we are interested in data with multiple relation types . There are many data mining and information retrieval applications in multi relational data which objects have interactions with the others based on different relations . For example , researchers cite the other researchers in different conferences , and based on different concepts/topics , papers cite the other papers based on text analysis such as title , abstract , keyword and authorship [ 14 ] , webpages link to the other webpages through different semantic meanings [ 13 ] . A social network [ 2 , 17 ] where objects are connected via multiple relations , by their organizational structure , communication protocols , etc . This additional link structure can provide a way of incorporating multiple relations among objects into the calculation of object importance or popularity . In Figure 1 , we show an example of a multi relational data set . There are five objects and three relations ( R1 : green , R2 : blue , R3 : red ) among them . We can also represent such multi relational data set in a tensor format . A tensor is a multidimensional array . In the figure , a three way array is used , where each two dimensional slice represents an adjacency matrix for a single relation . The data can be represented as a tensor of size 5 × 5 × 3 where ( i , j , k ) entry is nonzero if the ith object is connected to the jth object by using the kth relation .
In the literature , there is a lack of a general framework to deal with multi relational data or the corresponding tensor representation for co ranking purpose . The main aim of this paper is to propose an algorithm , MultiRank , to determine the importance of both objects and relations simultaneously in multi relational data . The MultiRank values indicate an importance of a particular object and an importance of a particular relation . In our proposal , the MultiRank of an object depends on the number and MultiRank metric of all objects that have multiple relations to this object , and also the MultiRank values of these multiple relations . An object that is linked via high MultiRank relations by objects with high MultiRanks , receives a high MultiRank itself . Similarly , the MultiRank of a relation depends on which objects

Similar to PageRank [ 19 ] , our idea is to imagine infinite random surfers in a multi relational data/tensor , and consider an equilibrium/stationary probability distribution of objects and relations as evaluation scores for objects and relations respectively . Thus we can consider that MultiRank is a stationary probability distribution that is used to represent the likelihood that we randomly visiting objects and using relations will arrive at any particular object and use any particular relation . However , instead of finding an eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the PageRank matrix [ 19 ] under a single relation type , our approach is to solve a set of tensor ( multivariate polynomial ) equations to determine a stationary probability distribution arising from a tensor that represents multiple relation types among objects .
The main contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows . ( i ) We propose a framework ( MultiRank ) to determine the importance of both objects and relations simultaneously based on a stationary probability distribution computed from multi relational data . ( ii ) We show the existence and uniqueness of such stationary probability distribution so that it can be used in co ranking for objects and relations very effectively . ( iii ) We develop an efficient iterative algorithm to solve a set of tensor equations to obtain such stationary probability distribution . Extensive experiments on real world data suggest that the proposed framework is able to provide a co ranking scheme for objects and relations based on stationary probability distribution successfully . Experimental results have also shown that our algorithm is computationally efficient , and effective for identification of interesting and explainable co ranking results .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . In Section 2 , we describe notations in this paper and some preliminary knowledge . In Section 3 , we present the proposed framework . In Section 4 , we analyze the proposed methodology . In Section 5 , we figure out the differences between the existing work and the proposed one . In Section 6 , we show and discuss the experimental results for real world data sets . In Section 7 , we give some concluding remarks and mention some future work .
2 . PRELIMINARY
In this section , we describe notations and present some preliminary knowledge on tensors . As we analyze objects under multiple relations and also consider interaction between relations based on objects , we make use of rectangular tensors to represent them .
Let R be the real field . We call A = ( ai1,i2,j1 ) where ∈ R , for ik = 1,· ·· , m , k = 1 , 2 and j1 = 1 , ··· , n , ai1,i2,j1 a real ( 2 , 1)th order ( m× n) dimensional rectangular tensor . In this setting , we refer ( i1 , i2 ) to be the indices for objects and j1 to be the index for relations . For instance , five objects ( m = 5 ) and three relations ( n = 3 ) are used in the example be vectors of length m , and y be in Figure 1 . Let x and x a vector of length n . Let Axy be a vector in Rm such that
. ai1,i2,j1 xi2 yj1
, i1 = 1 , 2 , ··· , m .
0 ≤ oi1,i2,j1
≤ 1 ,
0 ≤ ri1,i2,j1
≤ 1 , m . n . i1=1 j1=1 oi1,i2,j1 = 1 , ri1,i2,j1 = 1 . m . n .
( Axy)i1 = Similarly , Axx j1=1 i2=1 . is a vector in Rn such that m . m .
( Axx
.
)j1 = ai1,i2,j1 xi1 x . i2
, j1 = 1 , 2 , ··· , n . i1=1 i2=1
In addition , A is called non negative if ai1,i2,j1
≥ 0 .
As we consider infinite random surfers in a nonnegative rectangular tensor arising from multi relational data , and study the likelihood that we will arrive at any particular object and use at any particular relation , we can construct two transition probability tensors O = ( oi1,i2,j1 ) and R = ( ri1,i2,j1 ) with respect to objects and relations by normalizing the entries of A as follows : m . ai1,i2,j1 , i1 = 1 , 2,··· , m , oi1,i2,j1 = ai,i2,j1 ri1,i2,j1 = i=1 n . ai1,i2,j1 ai1,i2,j j=1 j1 = 1 , 2 , ··· , n .
,
These numbers gives the estimates of the following conditional probabilities : oi1,i2,j1 = Prob[Xt = i1|Xt−1 = i2 , Yt = j1 ] ri1,i2,j1 = Prob[Yt = j1|Xt = i1 , Xt−1 = i2 ] where Xt and Yt are random variables referring to visit at any particular object and to use at any particular relation respectively at the time t . oi1,i2,j1 can be interpreted as the probability of visiting the i1th object by given that the i2th object is currently visited and the j1th relation is used , and ri1,i2,j1 can be interpreted as the probability of using the j1th relation given that the i1th object is visited from the i2th object . We note that if ai1,i2,j1 is equal to 0 for all 1 ≤ i1 ≤ m , this is called the dangling node [ 19 ] , and the values of oi1,i2,j1 can be set to 1/m ( an equal chance to visit any object ) . Similarly , if ai1,i2,j1 is equal to 0 for all 1 ≤ j1 ≤ n , then the values of ri1,i2,j1 can be set to 1/n ( an equal chance to use any relation ) . With the above construction , we have
1218 Both O and R are nonnegative tensors . We call them transition probability tensors which are high dimensional analog of transition probability matrices in Markov chains [ 20 ] .
In addition , it is necessary for us to know the connectivity among the objects and the relations within a tensor . We remark that the concept of irreducibility has been used in the PageRank matrix in order to compute the PageRank vector [ 19 ] .
Definition 1 . A ( 2 , 1)th order nonnegative rectangular tensor A is called irreducible if ( ai1,i2,j1 ) ( m by m matrices ) for fixed j1 ( j1 = 1 , 2,· ·· , n ) are irreducible . If A is not irreducible , then we call A reducible .
When A is irreducible , any two objects in multi relational data can be connected via some relations . As we would like to determine the importance of both objects and relations simultaneously in multi relational data , irreducibility is a reasonable assumption that we will use in the following analysis and discussion . It is clear that when A is irreducible , the two corresponding tensors O and R are also irreducible .
3 . THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK
The PageRank matrix can be regarded as a transition probability matrix of a Markov chain in a random walk . Given two transition probability tensors O and R , we study the following probabilities :
Prob[Xt = i1 ] =
Prob[Yt = j1 ] = oi1,i2,j1
× Prob[Xt−1 = i2 , Yt = j1 ] i2=1 j1=1 m . m . i1=1 i2=1
( 1 ) ×Prob[Xt = i1 , Xt−1 = i2 ] , ri1,i2,j1
( 2 ) where Prob[Xt−1 = i2 , Yt = j1 ] is the joint probability distribution of Xt−1 and Yt , and Prob[Xt = i1 , Xt−1 = i2 ] is the joint probability distribution of Xt and Xt−1 . In our approach , we consider an equilibrium/stationary distribution of objects and relations , ie , we are interested in MultiRank values of objects and relations given by
¯x = [ ¯x1 , ¯x2 , ··· , ¯xm ]
T and ¯y = [ ¯y1 , ¯y2,··· , ¯yn ]
T respectively , with t→∞ Prob[Xt = i1 ] and ¯yj1 = lim
¯xi1 = lim for 1 ≤ i1 ≤ m and 1 ≤ j1 ≤ n . t→∞ Prob[Yt = j1 ] .
In general , it may be difficult to obtain ¯xi1 and ¯yj1 as ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are coupled together and they involves two joint probability distributions . Here we employ a product form of individual probability distributions for joint probability distributions in ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) . More precisely , we assume that m . n . t goes to infinity , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) becomes
¯xi1 = oi1,i2,j1 ¯xi2 ¯yj1 i1 = 1 , 2,·· · , m ,
,
¯yj1 = ri1,i2,j1 ¯xi1 ¯xi2 ; j1 = 1 , 2,· ·· , n . m . m . i2=1 n . m . j1=1 i1=1 i2=1
( 5 )
( 6 )
We see from ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) that the MultiRank of an object depends on the number and MultiRank metric of all objects that have multiple relations to this object , and also the MultiRank values of these multiple relations . Similarly , the MultiRank of a relation depends on which the objects to be linked and their MultiRank values of these objects . It is clear that an object that is linked via high MultiRank relations by objects with high MultiRank , receives a high MultiRank itself . Also a relation that is linked objects with high MultiRank values , receives a high MultiRank itself . Under the tensor operation for ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) , we solve the following tensor ( multivariate polynomial ) equations : with

¯xi1 = 1 and
= ¯y ,
¯yj1 = 1
( 7 )
( 8 ) i1=1 j1=1 to obtain the MultiRank values of objects and relations .
We remark that the normalized eigenvector ( corresponding to the largest eigenvalue 1 ) in the PageRank computation can be interpreted as the stationary probability distribution vector of the associated Markov chain [ 19 ] . When we consider a single relation type , we can set ¯y to be a vector 1 n l ( equal chance of all relations ) in ( 7 ) , and thus we obtain a matrix equation O¯x 1 n l = ¯x . This is exactly the same as that we solve for the normalized eigenvector to get the PageRank vector . As a summary , the proposed framework MultiRank is a generalization of PageRank to deal with multi relational data . 3.1 The Algorithm
In this subsection , we present an efficient iterative algorithm to solve the tensor equations in ( 7 ) to obtain ¯x and ¯y for the MultiRank values of objects and relations . The MultiRank algorithm is summarized in the following algorithm . fim i1=1[x0]i1 = 1 and
Algorithm 1 The MultiRank Algorithm fin Input : Two tensors O and R , two initial probability distributions x0 and y0 ( j1=1[y0]j1 = 1 ) and the tolerance Output : Two stationary probability distributions ¯x and ¯y Procedure : 1 : Set k = 1 ; 2 : Compute xk = Oxk−1yk−1 ; 3 : Compute yk = Rx2 k ; 4 : If ||xk − xk−1|| + ||yk − yk−1|| < , then stop , otherwise set k = k + 1 and goto Step 2 .
Prob[Xt−1 = i2 , Yt = j1 ] = Prob[Xt−1 = i2]Prob[Yt = j1 ] ( 3 ) Prob[Xt = i1 , Xt−1 = i2 ] = Prob[Xt = i1]Prob[Xt−1 = i2 ] . ( 4 ) Therefore , by using the above assumptions and considering
In Algorithm 1 , the MultiRank computations require several iterations , through the collection to adjust approximate MultiRank values of objects and relations to more closely reflect their theoretical true values ( underlying stationary probability distributions ) . The iterative method is similar
1219 to the power method for computing the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of a matrix [ 19 ] . The main computational cost of the MultiRank algorithm depends on the cost of performing tensor operations in Steps 2 and 3 . Assume that there are O(N ) nonzero entries ( sparse data ) in O and R , the cost of these tensor calculations are of O(N ) arithmetic operations .
4 . THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
In this section , we show the existence and uniqueness of stationary probability distributions ¯x and ¯y so that it can be used in co ranking for objects and relations very effectively . Based on these results , the convergence of MultiRank algofim rithm can be shown . We let Ωm = {x = ( x1 , x2,··· , xm ) ∈ Rm|xi ≥ 0 , 1 ≤ fin i ≤ m , i=1 xi = 1} and Ωn = {y = ( y1 , y2,··· , yn ) ∈ j=1 yj = 1} . We also set Ω = Rn|yj ≥ 0 , 1 ≤ j ≤ n , {[x , y ] ∈ Rm+n|x ∈ Ωm , y ∈ Ωn} . We note that Ωm , Ωn and Ω are closed convex sets . We call x and y to be positive ( denoted by x > 0 and y > 0 ) if all their entries are positive . It is easy to check that if both x and y are probability distributions , then the output Oxy and Rx2 are also probability distributions ( the correctness of Steps 2 and 3 in the MultiRank Algorithm ) .
Theorem 1 . Suppose O and R are constructed in Section 3 . For any x ∈ Ωm and y ∈ Ωn , then Oxy ∈ Ωm and Rx2 ∈ Ωn .
By using Theorem 1 , we show the existence of positive solutions for the set of tensor equations in ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) .
Theorem 2 . Suppose O and R are constructed in Section 3 . If O and R are irreducible , then there exist ¯x ∈ Ωm and ¯y ∈ Ωn such that O¯x¯y = ¯x and R¯x2 = ¯y , and both ¯x and ¯y are positive .
Proof . The problem can be reduced to a fixed point problem as follows . We define the following mapping T : Ω → Ω as follows
T ( [x , y ] ) = [ Oxy,Rx
2
] .
( 9 ) It is clear that T is well defined ( ie , when [ x , y ] ∈ Ω , T ( [x , y ] ) ∈ Ω ) and continuous . According to the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem , there exists [ ¯x , ¯y ] ∈ Ω such that T ( [¯x , ¯y ] ) = [ ¯x , ¯y ] , ie , O¯x¯y = ¯x and R¯x2 = ¯y .
Next we show that ¯x and ¯y are positive . Suppose ¯x and ¯y are not positive , ie , there exist some entries of ¯x are zero and some entries of ¯y are zero . Let I = {i1|¯xi1 = 0} and J = {j1|¯yj1 = 0} . It is obvious that I is a proper subset of {1 , 2 , ··· , m} and J is a proper subset of {1 , 2 , ··· , n} . Let δ = min{min{¯xi1 |j1 /∈ J}} . We must have δ > 0 . Since ¯x and ¯y satisfies O¯x¯y = ¯x , we have n .
|i1 /∈ I} , min{¯yj1 m . oi1,i2,j1 ¯xi2 ¯yj1 = ¯xi1 = 0 ,
∀i1 ∈ I .
Let us consider the following quantity : i2=1 j1=1
. i2 /∈I
. j1 /∈J
δ2 oi1,i2,j1
. ≤ i2 /∈I ≤ m .
. j1 /∈J n . i2=1 j1=1 oi1,i2,j1 ¯xi2 ¯yj1 oi1,i2,j1 ¯xi2 ¯yj1 = 0 , for all i1 ∈ I . Hence we have oi1,i2,j1 = 0 for all i1 ∈ I and for all i2 /∈ I for any fixed j1 /∈ J . Thus the matrices ( oi1,i2,j1 ) ( for j1 /∈ J ) are reducible . It implies that O is reducible . By using the similar argument and considering the equation Rx2 = y , we can find that R is also reducible . According to these results , we obtain a contradiction . Hence both ¯x and ¯y must be positive .
In [ 11 ] , it has been given a general condition which guarantees the uniqueness of the fixed point in the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem , namely , ( i ) 1 is not an eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of the mapping , and ( ii ) for each point in the boundary of the domain of the mapping , it is not a fixed point . In our case , we have shown in Theorem 2 that all the fixed points of T are positive when O and R are irreducible , ie , they do not lie on the boundary ∂Ω of Ω . The Jacobian ff matrix of T is an ( m + n) by (m + n ) matrix :

,
[ x , y ] ∈ Ω ,
DT ( [x , y ] ) =
DT11([x , y ] ) DT12([x , y ] ) DT21([x , y ] ) fin 0 j1=1 oi1,i2,j1 fim i2=1 oi1,i2,j1 fim i1=1 ri1,i2,j1 where DT11([x , y ] ) = ( yj1 )i1,i2 is an m bym matrix corresponding to the derivative of Oxy with respect to x , DT12([x , y ] ) = ( xi2 )i1,j1 is an mby n matrix corresponding to the derivative of Oxy with fim respect to y , and DT21([x , y ] ) = ( xi1 )j1,i2 + xi2 )j1,i1 is an n by m matrix corresponding i2=1 ri1,i2,j1 ( to the derivative of Rx2 with respect to x . To conclude , we have the following theorem :
Theorem 3 . Suppose O and R are constructed in Section 3 , and they are irreducible . If 1 is not the eigenvalue of DT ( [x , y ] ) for all [ x , y ] ∈ Ω/∂Ω , then then the solution vectors ¯x and ¯y in Theorem 2 are unique .
According to Theorem 3 , when xk = xk−1 and yk = yk−1 in the MultiRank algorithm , then we obtain the unique solution vectors ¯x and ¯y for Oxy = x and Rx2 = y . When xk = xk−1 and yk = yk−1 , there exist a subsequence [ xks , yks ] converges to [ ¯x,¯y ] by using the fact that Ω is compact in Rm+n . As we have shown that the solution vectors are unique , it implies that [ xk,yk ] converges ( up to a subsequence ) to [ ¯x,¯y ] which are the stationary probability vectors giving MultiRank values of objects and relations respectively for co ranking purpose effectively .
5 . RELATED WORK
Recently , co ranking has been studied in [ 7 , 26 ] . In [ 7 ] , a co HITS algorithm is proposed to incorporate the bipartite graph with the content information from both sides as well as the constraints of relevance . In [ 26 ] , a method for co ranking authors and their publications using several networks is proposed and based on coupling two random walks that separately rank authors and documents following the PageRank paradigm . In these two methods , the score propagation is the mutual reinforcement to boost co linked entities on the graph only . We see from ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) that our method involves mutual reinforcement among all the objects and the relations . PopRank [ 18 ] uses the PageRank framework by adding popularity to each link pointing to an object . The main challenge of this approach is required to add popularity which is not known in general . The novelty of the proposed method is to provide a framework to determine the weights of relations automatically .
1220 In the literature , tensor factorization is a generalized approach for analyzing multi way interactions among entities . For instance , Lin et al . [ 17 ] proposed a novel relational hypergraph representation for modeling multi relational and multi dimensional social data and studied an efficient factorization method for community extraction on a given metagraph . Sun et al . proposed a general and efficient framework for analyzing high order and high dimensional stream data [ 21 , 22 ] . Sun et al . [ 23 ] applied a 3 way Tucker decomposition [ 24 ] to the analysis of user , query term and webpage data in order to personalize web search . Acar et al . [ 1 ] used various tensor decompositions of user , keyword and time data to separate different streams of conservations in chatroom data . Kolda et al . [ 14 , 13 ] proposed TOPHITS by adding a third dimension to form an adjacency tensor that incorporates anchor text information , and then to increase the likelihood that the principal singular vectors relate to the query . They also employed a Three way Parallel Factors ( PARAFAC ) decomposition [ 4 , 10 ] to compute the singular vectors for query processing . In these methods , we need to select the number of decompositions ( low rank approximation ) in the tensor factorization . The number of decompositions may not be known in advance . On the other hand , the computation of tensor factorization may not be unique as there are several numerical methods ( eg , the alternating least squares procedure ) used to compute such factorization and the factorization results depend on the initial guess . There is no detailed algorithmic and mathematical analysis for the convergence of the method . Also the computational cost may be expensive for very large tensors [ 6 ] . Different from these methods , we compute stationary probability distributions of tensors for scores of objects and relations to handle the ranking problem . We have shown that such probability distributions can be unique and computed very efficiently .
6 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section , we report three experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed model for co ranking objects and relations from real world data sets . We crawled publication information of five conferences ( SIGKDD , WWW , SIGIR , SIGMOD , CIKM ) from DBLP1 . Their publication periods are as follows : SIGKDD ( 1999 2010 ) , WWW ( 2001 2010 ) , SIGIR ( 2000 2010 ) , SIGMOD ( 2000 2010 ) and CIKM ( 2000 and 2002 2009 ) 2 . Publication information includes title , authors , reference list , and classification categories associated with this publication3 . There are in total 6848 publications , 10305 authors and 617 different categories in the data set . Based on this multi relational data , we construct different types of tensors in the following three experiments .
6.1 Experiment 1 Tensor construction . In this experiment , we construct a tensor A based on citations of authors ( objects ) through different category concepts ( relations ) . In this case there are 10305 objects and 617 relations . The tensor is constructed as follows : If a publication written by the i2th author cites a publication written by the i1th author , and the two publications have the same j1th category concept , then we can add one to the entry ai1,i2,j1 of A . By considering all the publications , ai1,i2,j1 refers to the number of citations of publications written by the i2th author to publications written by the i1th author where these publications have the same j1th category concept . Here we do not consider any self citation , ie , ai1,i1,j1 = 0 for all 1 ≤ i1 ≤ 10305 and 1 ≤ j1 ≤ 617 . The purpose is to avoid an ambiguous high self citations in A . The size of A is 10305× 10305× 617 and there are 39851 nonzeros entries in A . The percentage of nonzero entries is 6.08 × 10 −5 % , and thus A is sparse . After we construct A , we can generate both transition probability tensors O and R . The only nonzero entries and their locations are stored in the computational process . It is not necessary to store values 1/m or 1/n for the dangling nodes in O and R .

1http://wwwinformatikuni trierde/ ley/db/ 2Missing information for CIKM 2001 is due to fact that DBLP does not provide links to ACM Digital Library . 3For each publication , there are several strings indicating the classification categories of this publication , where each string provides the information from the most general concept to the most specific concept . For example , a string may be “ H . information systems—>H.3 information storage and retrieval—>H33 information search and retrieval ” . For each string , we choose the most specific concept as the classification category it indicates for the publication .
Results and discussion . Figure 2 shows the convergence of the MultiRank algorithm . We see from the figure that the changes of stationary probabilities for objects and relations , ||xk − xk−1||1 + ||yk − yk−1||1 , decreases when iteration number increases , and the successive difference after −20 which is small enough for 12 iterations , is less than 10 convergence criterion . The computational time is about 114 seconds under the MATLAB implementation in a standard desktop PC . In Figures 3(a) (b ) , we show the two resulting stationary probability vectors corresponding to the authors
1221 and the category concepts respectively . It is clear in the figures that some authors ( relations ) have higher stationary probabilities ( MultiRank values ) . These results indicate that some authors ( category concepts ) are more important ( popular ) than the others . ranking

Table 2 : The numbers that the top ten authors are cited by the others via the top ten category concepts .
In Table 1 , we show the top ten authors and category concepts based on their MultiRank values . As there are two types of conferences in the data set , one is based on data mining like SIGKDD and SIGMOD , and the other is based on information retrieval like WWW , SIGIR and CIKM . Therefore , these two concepts are ranked numbers one and two respectively . In Table 2 , we show the numbers that the top ten authors are cited by the others via the top ten category concepts . We find that there are many citations for the cited authors ( ranked numbers 1 to 5 ) via the data mining concept ( ranked number 1 ) , and there are many citations for the cited authors ( ranked numbers 6 to 10 ) via the information search and retrieval and retrieval model concepts ( ranked numbers 2 and 3 ) . This observation can explain why the first five authors have higher MultiRank values than the last five authors . Also there are more citations based on the first concept for the cited authors ( ranked numbers 2 , 4 and 5 ) than for the ranked number one author in Table 2 , we find in ( 7 ) that his MultiRank value by summing the scores of his linked objects and used relations together , is higher than those of the other cited authors .
Next we compare the MultiRank and PageRank results . In the PageRank algorithm , we aggregate all the citations of different concepts together to construct relations among the authors . In the PageRank results , Philip Yu , Thorsten Joachims and Susan T . Dumais do not appear in the list of the top ten cited authors , and the others still appear . Now they are ranked numbers 14 , 29 , and 13 respectively . However , there are three new persons : D . R . Mani ( rank #8 ) , James Drew ( ranked #9 ) and Andrew Betz ( rank #10 ) , who are co authors of papers cited by Pedro Domingos ( rank #1 ) in the PageRank results . Because Pedro Domingos has the highest PageRank score and cites less papers in the data set , these three persons also receive high PageRank scores even their citations are not many . Because the MultiRank algorithm gives the scores for concepts , it differentiates authors and concepts , and provides a more accurate and comparable ranking results than those by the PageRank algorithm . 6.2 Experiment 2 Tensor construction . In this experiment , we construct a ( 2 , 1)th order tensor A based on author author collaborations through different category concepts . When the i1th and i2th authors publish a paper together under the j1th category concept , we add one to the entries ai1,i2,j1 and ai2,i1,j1 of A . In this case , A is symmetric with respect to the index j1 . By considering all the publications , ai1,i2,j1 ( or ai2,i1,j1 ) refers to the number of collaborations by the i1th and the i2th authors under the j1th category concept . Again , we do not consider any self collaboration , ie , ai1,i1,j1 = 0 for all 1 ≤ i1 ≤ 10305 and 1 ≤ j1 ≤ 617 . The size of A is 10305× 10305× 617 and there are 95722 nonzeros entries in A . The percentage of nonzero entries is 1.46 × 10

Table 4 : The numbers that the top ten authors collaborate with the others via the top ten category concepts .
Results and discussion . We apply the MultiRank algorithm to the constructed tensors , and the algorithm converges in 10 iterations . In Figures 4(a ) and 4(b ) , we show the resulting stationary probabilities for the authors and category concepts . Based on the MultiRank values , we show in Table 3 the top ten authors and category concepts . When we compare the results in Experiments 1 and 2 , we find that the top ten category concepts changes slightly , ie , the
1222 concepts of query formulation and performance evaluation disappear in Experiment 2 while the concept of general and web based services appear . This phenomena may suggest the former two concepts are more likely to be used when authors cite the others , while the latter concept are more likely to be used when authors collaborate together . The top ten authors also changes significantly , eg , Philip S . Yu , Wei Ying Ma , Jiawei Han and Bing Liu remain in the list of the top ten collaborated authors . This phenomena suggests these four authors not only have high citations via the mostly used concepts , but also have more collaborations via the mostly used concepts in the five conferences . It is clear that the other top cited authors in Table 1(a ) have less collaborations in the five conferences . In Table 4 , we show the numbers that the top ten authors collaborate with the others via the top ten category concepts . We see from the table that there are many collaborations for the authors ( ranked numbers 1 to 5 ) via the top ten concepts , and there are less collaborations for the authors ( ranked numbers 6 to 10 ) via the top ten concepts .
6.3 Experiment 3
Tensor construction .
In this experiment , we co rank both authors and their papers . We need to construct a ( 2 , 2)th order tensor for calculating MultiRanks of both authors and papers . Our idea is that if a paper or an author has a high MultiRank value , then the publications or the authors cited by this paper/author have a high chance to obtain high MultiRank values ( see the tensor equations in
( 10) ) . There are four indices of the entry of A : ai1,i2,j1,j2 .
The first two indices ( for objects ) refer to the authors and the last two indices ( for relations ) refer to the papers . Here the role of objects and relations can be swapped . We set ai1,i2,j1,j2 to be 1 ( or 0 ) when the j2th paper written by the i2th author cite ( do not cite ) the j1th paper written by the i1th author .
The five conferences may have different topics or tasks , eg , WWW , SIGIR , and CIKM mainly focus on tasks related to information retrieval , while SIGKDD and SIGMOD mainly focus on tasks related data mining or databases . Here we construct three different tensors A based on the data from ( a ) all the five conferences ; ( b ) SIGKDD and SIGMOD conferences ; and ( c ) WWW , SIGIR and CIKM conferences . For each case , we construct the tensor as follows . Firstly , we select the top thirty cited authors in Experiment 1 , who have at least ten papers in the conferences . For each selected author , we select his/her ten most cited papers by the other papers in the same set of conferences . Again we do not consider any self citation , ie , we set ai1,i1,j1,j2 = 0 for all i1 , j1 and j2 . The sizes of A are 30 × 30 × 261 × 261 , 30× 30× 252× 252 and 30× 30× 258× 258 for the cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively . They have different sizes as there are some overlapped papers in the construction . There are 504 , 458 , 493 nonzeros entries in A for the case ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) respectively . The corresponding percentages of nonzero entries are 8.22 × 10 −4 % . In this experiment , we determine the MultiRanks of authors ¯x and papers ¯y by solving the following tensor equations :
−4 % and 8.23 × 10
−4 % , 8.01 × 10
2
O¯x¯y fim i1=1 ¯xi1 = 1 fin ( 10 ) j1=1 ¯yj1 = 1 . Based on the with idea in ( 7 ) , we can interpret the first equation in ( 10 ) by
= ¯x and R¯x and
2 ¯y = ¯y , k−1 and yk = Rx2 viewing paper paper citations ¯y2 as relations to give authors’ scores ¯x as objects , and the second equation in by viewing author author citations ¯x2 as relations to give papers’ scores ¯y as objects . We can employ the same MultiRank algorithm in Section 4.1 to solve the equations , except we compute xk = Oxk−1y2 kyk−1 in the iterative process . By using the similar arguments in Section 5 , we can show existence and uniqueness of the solution in ( 10 ) and the algorithm can converge to the unique solution . Results and discussion . We apply the MultiRank algorithm to three different cases , and obtain the stationary probabilities ( MultiRanks ) of the authors and their papers . The resulting top ten authors and top ten papers for the three cases are shown as in Table 5 . We see from the table that there are five top cited authors appearing in both Experiments 3(a ) and 3(c ) , and there are only two top cited authors appearing in both Experiments 3(a ) and 3(b ) . Also there are five top cited papers appearing in both Experiments 3(a ) and 3(c ) , and there is only one top cited paper appearing in both Experiments 3(a ) and 3(b ) . These results suggest that the data set may be imbalanced in the areas of data mining and information retrieval , and it is reasonable to perform co ranking for two separated cases ( b ) and ( c ) .
Moreover , we see from the Table 5 that the top ten cited authors and the top ten cited papers are strongly related in the three experiments , ie , most of the top ten cited authors have papers in the top ten cited papers , and most of the top ten cited papers are written by the top ten cited authors . This phenomena implies that our co ranking results are reasonable as an author ( or a paper ) cited by other papers/authors with high MultiRanks , receives a high MultiRank value . To further verify the co ranking results , we show in Table 6 the numbers that the top ten cited authors ( or the top ten cited papers ) are cited by the others of different rankings in Experiment 3(a ) . We see that the authors who are ranked higher usually have either more citations by highly ranked authors and more citations in total . Similar findings are observed for the top ten cited papers . These observations reflect the design of the MultiRank paradigm by setting equations in ( 10 ) . Similar observations can also be found in Experiment 3(b ) and 3(c ) .

It is interesting to note that Thorsten Joachims and Jon M . Kleinberg who are ranked number one and number two in Experiment 3(a ) , disappear in both Experiments 3(b ) and 3(c ) . They are the top cited authors for all five conferences , however , they are not the top cited authors either in data mining conferences or in information retrieval conferences . For Thorsten Joachims , this is because he does not have ten publications either in data mining conferences ( Experiment 3(b ) ) or information retrieval conferences ( Experiment

Kleinberg , even though he has enough publications in Experiment 3(b ) , he disappears in the list of the top ten cited authors . The main reason is that his high cited paper titled “ Bursty and hierarchical structure in streams ” published in SIGKDD conference , is more related to information retrieval conferences . Therefore , he does not have many citations from data mining conferences in Experiment 3(b ) .
7 . CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper , we have proposed a framework ( MultiRank ) to determine the importance of both objects and relations simultaneously based on a probability distribution computed from multi relational data . Both theoretical and experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed algorithm is efficient and effective . Here we give several future research work based on the proposed framework .
( i ) In the framework , we assume probability distributions satisfying ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . It is interesting to employ the other possible forms to set up other tensor equations , compute and analyze stationary probability distributions .
( ii ) We consider the ( 2,1)th and ( 2,2)th order rectangular transition probability tensors theoretically and numerically in this paper . We can further study and extend to the other types of rectangular transition probability tensors . For instance , ( p , q)th order rectangular transition probability tenIn this setting , we employ the pth sors can be studied . order links among the objects and qth order links among the relations . Such higher order links have been studied in higher order Markov chains , see for instance [ 5 ] . Based on the proposed framework , we expect to solve the following set of tensor equations :
Ox p−1 q y
= x and Rx q−1 p y
= y . p t y p−1 t−1 y
In the MultiRank algorithm , we compute xt = Ox q t−1 and yt = Rx q−1 t−1 in Steps 2 and 3 respectively . By using a similar argument , we expect to show existence and uniqueness of x and y in these higher order links among the objects and relations . ( iii ) On the other hand , we can study ( p1 , p2,··· , ps)th order rectangular tensors where there are s different kinds of objects/relations to be analyzed . For instance , there are s networks and each network are related to each other based on their objects and relations . In the literature , there are many multiple networks applications and analysis , see for instance [ 17 , 25 , 26 ] . In this setting , we expect to set up a set of tensor equations similar to ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) , and solve it for MultiRank values of objects/relations in these multiple networks .
( iv ) We give a generalization of PageRank in this paper . We can study and extend HITS algorithm for computing the scores of hub and authority in multi relational data . By using the graph structure of hub and authority , we solve a new set of tensor equations to obtain such scores :
Hyz = x , Axz = y , Rxy = z ,
Here three transition probability tensors H , A and R corresponds to hubs , authorities and relations , x , y are the authority and hub scores of objects , and z are relevance scores of relations . The detailed work can be found in [ 16 ] .
( v ) Theoretically , we need the assumption in Theorem 3 in order to show that ¯x and ¯y are unique . We have tested many different initial probability distributions in the examples in Section 6 , the same resulting probability vector is obtained . We conjecture that the assumption in the theorem may be
1224 true for irreducible transition probability tensors with some additional properties . We do not have a proof yet , so we leave it as an open problem for future analysis .
