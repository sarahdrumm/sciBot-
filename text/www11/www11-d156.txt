ABSTRACT In this work we propose that the high volumes of data on real time networks like Twitter can be harnessed as a useful source of recommendation knowledge . We describe Buzzer , a news recommendation system that is capable of adapting to the conversations that are taking place on Twitter . Buzzer uses a content based approach to ranking RSS news stories by mining trending terms from both the public Twitter timeline and from the timeline of tweets generated by a user ’s own social graph ( friends and followers ) . We also describe the result of a live user trial which demonstrates how these ranking strategies can add value to conventional RSS ranking techniques , which are largely recency based .

INTRODUCTION
We view the emergence of the real time web as a way of harnessing real time and time sensitive data , such as tweets on public and personal Twitter streams , as a basis for recommending news items . Applied research has already been published relating to Twitter data applications [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 ] . We have previously presented an early basic prototype of the Buzzer system [ 7 ] that focussed on real time ranking .
Here , we widely extend the basic technique with four new overlapping content based recommendation strategies [ 1 , 5 ] and describe the result of a large scale live user trial with 35 users over a 1 month period , based on more than 30,000 news stories and in excess of 50 million Twitter messages .
Buzzer generates two indexes of content — one from Twitter ( including public tweets and Buzzer user tweets ) and one ∗This work is gratefully supported by Science Foundation Ireland under Grant No . 07/CE/11147 CLARITY CSET .

Figure 1 : Buzzer ’s personalized news results from the RSS feeds of Buzzer users . Buzzer looks for cooccurances of content between the terms that are present in tweets and RSS articles and ranks articles accordingly . In this way articles with content that appear to match the content of recent Twitter chatter ( whether public or user related ) will receive high scores during recommendation .
Figure 1 shows a sample list of recommendations for a particular user . Buzzer is a web application and can take the place of a user ’s normal RSS reader : the user continues to have access to their favourite RSS feeds but in addition , by synching Buzzer with their Twitter account , they may potentially benefit from a more informative ranking of news stories based on their inferred interests . 1.1 Algorithms & Strategies
Each Buzzer user brings both their RSS subscriptions and their Twitter social graph to the system . With these sources , we build a number of different ways of combining tweets and RSS content during recommendation , and in this paper we explore 4 different recommendation strategies ( S1−S4 ) . For example , stories/articles can be mined from a user ’s personal RSS feeds or those of the wider Buzzer community . Moreover , stories can be ranked based on the tweets of people the user follows , or from the tweets of the public Twitter timeline .
WWW 2011 – PosterMarch 28–April 1 , 2011 , Hyderabad , India103 We combine these sources to generate 4 strategies : S1 — Stories from Personal RSS Articles ranked by the Public Twitter Feed , S2 — Stories from Personal RSS Articles ranked by your Twitter friends , S3 — Articles from the Buzzer Community ’s RSS Feeds ranked by the Public Twitter Feed , S4 — Articles from the Buzzer Community ’s RSS Feeds ranked by your Twitter friends . Our evaluation uses a 5th strategy of recency of RSS articles as a benchmark .
The system generates results from these recommendation strategies , by mining feeds of tweets and RSS items for cooccuring terms , building a term frequency vector of these terms and uses this vector as a basis of retrieving relevant RSS items from a given RSS index . Item scoring is a sum of each TF IDF score of each returned individual item across the vector of terms , so if an item is in the result list of many terms , its score is summed and added to a final result list and ranked . We do this process for each of the four strategies outlined previously , and the system randomly interleaves each of the five ( S1 S5 ) strategies into one final list .
2 . USER TRIAL
The trial consisted of 35 active Buzzer users ( used the system two or more times ) who were emailed a result list daily . The results presented relate to usage data gathered during the 31 days of March 2010 . During this timeframe we gathered a total of 56 million public tweets ( for use in strategies S1 and S3 ) and 537,307 tweets from the social graphs of the 35 registered users ( for use in strategies S2 and S4 ) . In addition , the 35 users registered a total of 281 unique RSS feeds as story sources and during the trial period these feeds generated a total of 31,137 unique stories/articles . During the trial , Buzzer issued 1,085 emails . We considered the participants as active Twitter users , with averages of 145 friends , 196 followers and 1241 tweets sent . Overall our interest is not so much concerned with whether one strategy is superior to others — because in reality we believe that different strategies are likely to have a role to play in news story recommendation — but rather to explore the reaction of users to the combination of strategies . 2.1 Results
Figure 2A presents total click throughs per strategy . Users registered 15 or so RSS feeds as part of their Buzzer signup and the stories ranked by S3 and S4 , for a given user , came from the 250+ other feeds contributed by the participants . Overall , we can see that strategies S1 and S2 tend to outperform the other strategies ; for example , S1 and S2 received about 110 click throughs each , just over 35 % more than strategies S3 and S4 , and about about 20 % more than the default recency strategy , S5 . There is a clear preference for stories from personal feeds , strategies S1 and S2 attract more click throughs than when ranked by recency ( S5 ) . But also , participants responded less frequently to stories ranked highly by strategies S3 and S4 , although these strategies still attract about 30 % of total click throughs . We feel that this highlights the power of item discovery in our system .
It is also useful to consider whether particular strategies tended to win out over other strategies on a day by day basis . We can judge a strategy Si to win on day dj if Si receives more click throughs than any other during dj . Figure 2B shows the result of this analysis across the 31 trial days , for each of the 5 strategies . Strategy S2 ( user ’s personal RSS
Figure 2 : Main Results feeds ranked by the tweets of their social graph ) wins out overall , dominating the click throughs of 10 out of the 31 days . Recency ( S5 ) comes a close second ( winning on 8 of the days ) . Overall strategies S3 and S4 do less well here , collectively winning on only 3 of the 31 days .
3 . CONCLUSION
We have presented a novel content based real time news recommendation and discovery system , with a large scale user trial and interesting results that influence our future directions . We hope to expand the discovery system with a hybrid approach ( sharing activities of users as a rating system ) and focus on content and metrics from the users personal social graph , as we feel it yields the most interesting results . Further information and in depth analysis of data from this evaluation is also available [ 6 ] .
