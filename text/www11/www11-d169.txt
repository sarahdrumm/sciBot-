ABSTRACT How often did you feel disappointed in a foreign country , when you had been craving for participating in authentic native events but miserably ended up with being lost in the crowd , due to ignorance of the local culture ? Have you ever imagined that with merely a simple click , a tool can identify the events that are right in front of you ? As a step in this direction , in this paper , we propose a system that provides users with information of the public events that they are attending by analyzing in real time their photos taken at the event , leveraging both spatio temporal context and photo content . To fulfill the task , we designed the system to collect event information , maintain dedicated event database , build photo content model for event types , and rank the final results . Extensive experiments were conducted to prove the effectiveness of each component .

INTRODUCTION
When we are traveling in foreign countries , it is often a big problem for us to understand the events or activities that are going on in the local area . The difficulty prohibits common tourists from better appreciating different places and cultures . Can we create a tool that is capable of determining these events and delivering information about them in real time ?
Efforts have been made on utilizing the rich data on the web to provide knowledge to end users . However , no existing approaches can fully satisfy our need . Traditional web search engines rely on keyword indexing . Although many techniques have been proposed to better understand user intentions in search , the gap between concepts and keywords still exists . Work on semantic web and related search have ∗ crosoft Research Asia as a research intern .

Visual search has gained increasing popularity and worked successfully for certain objects and text[3 ] . However , due to the semantic gap , the approach is insufficient for concepts with richer semantic meaning , like event .

Figure 1 : System Architecture
In this work , we propose a system that provides users with information of the public events that they are attending by analyzing in real time their photos taken at the event . Whenever a user wants to know about an event she is currently at , she only needs to take a picture of it . By examining the photo content together with the spatial and temporal data carried with it , our system automatically returns a ranked list of events with which the photo may be associated . Our approach has the following advantages . 1 ) Use of the system is very intuitive and requires no special efforts ; 2 ) The system keeps a dedicated event database and index , and automatically constructs queries for users , which enables the delivery of exact event information ; 3 ) Our system not only detects planned events , but also tries to discover concurrent events by analyzing real time micro blogs ; 4 ) Different types of events do reveal distinct visual characteristics , so visual content is also taken into account to improve search results . As far as we know , there is no previous work that has addressed a similar problem . 2 . OUR APPROACH
Problem We define a contextual photo as p = ( img , time , location ) , where img is the image content of the photo p ,
WWW 2011 – PosterMarch 28–April 1 , 2011 , Hyderabad , India37 and time and location = ( latitude , longitude ) correspond to the timestamp and geo coordinate of the photo p . We model event as e = ( time , location , title , description , type , media ) . time = ( start , end ) defines the time interval during which e occurs . location = ( lat1 , long1 , lat2 , long2 ) represents the geo coordinates of the southwest and northeast corner of the place where e takes place . Name of the event e is stored in title , and the textual explanation to e is saved in description . Event types , such as performances , exhibitions , sports are stored in type . Media data , eg posters and photos , is kept in media attribute . Given an incoming contextual photo p , our problem is to compute a ranked list of events ( e1 , , en ) , which are in decreasing order of likelihood that ei is the event at which the photo p was taken .
Approach We present the system architecture in Figure
1 . Our system consists of the following major steps .
1 . We create an event database , and ingest both planned and emergent events into it . Planned events , which are usually pre declared online , are extracted from web pages or downloaded via web services that perform event integration . Emergent events , the occurrence of which are impromptu , are detected from Twitter by following the approach in [ 1 ] . 2 . After an user takes a photo for an event , her capturing device creates a contextual photo containing the image content , time and location information . The device then sends this contextual photo to our system as a query .
In our system , 3 . First , given the time and location information in the contextual photo , a query is issued to the event database , which returns a list of related events .
4 . Then the content analysis component analyzes the image content and returns the event type of the event captured in the photo . In this work , we model the relationship between event types and the raw visual features through a middle layer of visual concepts . We employed a learning based approach to perform the analysis , which consists of four major steps : 1 ) Train concept detector ; 2 ) Detect concepts from photos associated with different event types ; 3 ) Train event type detector ; 4 ) For each incoming photo , based on the models , decide which type of event the photo is most likely to be .
5 . Both the event list from event database and the detected event type are given to the ranking component . The component considers spatial , temporal , and visual distances in the final ranking process .
6 . Finally , a ranked list of events and their associated information are returned to the user and presented on her device . 3 . EXPERIMENTS
We conducted experiments on both Flickr dataset and a real event photo set shot in New York City .
Flickr Dataset In this experiment , we verify the hypothesis that people do take photos at events . And by making use of the taking time and location of photos , we are able to match them to the corresponding events . We built the event database for events in NYC from year 2008 to 2010 . Also , we called the Flickr API and downloaded all the photos shot from year 2008 till June 2010 . We matched the photos to the events in the event database . Figure 2 shows examples of matched events and photos . The left column details the events and the urls where these events were extracted , and the right column lists the photos taken at the events .
Real Photo set In this section , we test on real photo

Figure 2 : Examples of matched events and photos . sets collected from 4 volunteers living in NYC . We asked each volunteer to hang around on streets in NYC during their spare time , in August and September 2010 , and try attending some events that they discovered . They were advised to take as many pictures as possible at the event , and there were no requirements on the subjects of these photos . The ranking result is depicted in Figure 3 . The photo column shows a sample of pictures from each photo set , and the result column lists the top 5 ranking result for most pictures in the photo set . The last column provides the ground truth of these events . For event 1 , 3 , and 4 , we correctly returned the information of the corresponding events on the first place in ranked lists . But for event 2 , since the exact event was not stored in our database , our system returned a musical event in the Mitzi Newhouse Theater of Lincoln Center , which was a very close match .
