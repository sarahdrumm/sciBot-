ABSTRACT The Web has developed into a global information space consisting not just of linked documents , but also of Linked Data . In 2010 , we have seen significant growth in the size of the Web of Data , as well as in the number of communities contributing to its creation . In addition to publishing and interlinking datasets , there is intensive work on developing Linked Data browsers , Linked Data crawlers , Web of Data search engines and other applications that consume Linked Data from the Web .
The goal of the 4th Linked Data on the Web workshop ( LDOW2011 ) is to provide a forum for exposing high quality research on Linked Data as well as to showcase innovative Linked Data applications . In addition , by bringing together researchers in this field , we expect the event to further shape the Linked Data research agenda .

1 . LINKED DATA
The term Linked Data [ 1 ] refers to a set of best practices for publishing and interlinking structured data on the Web . These best practices were introduced in 2006 by Tim Berners Lee and have become known as the Linked Data principles . The basic idea of Linked Data is to apply the general architecture of the World Wide Web to the task of sharing structured data on a global scale . Technically , Linked Data is about employing Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs ) , the Resource Description Framework ( RDF )

Just as hyperlinks in the classic Web connect documents into a single global information space , Linked Data provides for setting RDF links between data items in different data sources , thereby connecting these sources into a single global data space—the Web of Data [ 2 ] .
The Web of Data can be accessed using Linked Data browsers , just as the traditional Web of documents is accessed using HTML browsers . However , instead of following links between HTML pages , Linked Data browsers enable users to navigate between different data sources by following RDF links . This allows the user to start with one data source and then move through a potentially endless Web of data sources connected by RDF links . Linked Data Search engines crawl the Web of Data and provide sophisticated query capabilities on top of the complete data space , similar to those provided by conventional relational databases . Because the query results themselves are structured data , not just links to HTML pages , they can be immediately processed , thus enabling a new class of applications based on the Web of Data [ 5 , 6 ] .
In addition to providing for the link based discovery of new data sources , Linked Data also aims at easing the integration of data from different sources by relying on shared vocabularies , making the definitions of these vocabularies Web retrievable , and by allowing terms from different vocabularies to be mapped to each other by RDF links .
2 . THE WEB OF DATA
Increasing numbers of data providers and application developers have begun to adopt Linked Data [ 3 ] . In doing so they have created a global , interconnected data space . Just as the classic document Web is diverse in its topical coverage , so the Web of Data spans numerous topical domains , containing data about people , companies , films , music , locations , books and other publications , online communities , as well as an increasing amount of scientific and government data .
Figure 1 gives an overview of the Web of Data . Each node in the diagram represents a distinct data set published as Linked Data . The arcs indicate the existence of links between items in the two data sets . As of September 2010 , the Web of Data is estimated to contain 26 billion RDF triples and over 400 million cross data set links [ 4 ] .

Relatively recent additions to the Web of Data , such as Ordnance Survey , New York Times and various government data sets from the UK and US , demonstrate how the Web of Data is evolving from data publication primarily by third party enthusiasts and researchers , to data publication at source by large media and public sector organisations .
3 . THE WORKSHOP
LDOW2011 in Hyderabad ( India ) follows the LDOW2008 workshop in Beijing ( China ) , the LDOW2009 workshop in Madrid ( Spain ) , and the LDOW2010 workshop in Raleigh ( USA ) . As with the previous workshops , LDOW2011 is open to covering all topics related to Linked Data publication and consumption , including principled research in the areas of user interfaces for the Web of Data as well as on issues of quality , trust and provenance in Linked Data .
We also expect to see a number of submissions related to current areas of high Linked Data activity , such as government transparency , life sciences and the media industry .
The goal of this workshop is to provide a forum for exposing high quality , novel research and applications in these ( and related ) areas . In addition , by bringing together researchers and practitioners in this field , we expect the event to further shape the ongoing Linked Data research agenda .
