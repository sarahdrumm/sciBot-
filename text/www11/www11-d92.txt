ABSTRACT We consider the problem of automatically extracting general lists from the web . Existing approaches are mostly dependent upon either the underlying HTML markup or the visual structure of the Web page . We present HyLiEn an unsupervised , Hybrid approach for automatic List discovery and Extraction on the Web . It employs general assumptions about the visual rendering of lists , and the structural representation of items contained in them . We show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods .

INTRODUCTION
This work focuses on extracting information from lists on the Web . Lists are interesting because they present information in a condensed , well structured way . The characteristics of Web lists vary widely . Consequently , a great variety of computational approaches have been applied to discover and extract the information embedded in lists . These existing approaches mostly rely on the underlying HTML markup and corresponding DOM structure of a Web page [ 6 , 1 , 7 ] . Unfortunately , HTML was initially designed for rendering purposes and not for information structuring ( like XML ) . As a result , a list can be rendered in several ways in HTML , and it is difficult to find an HTML only tool that is sufficiently robust to extract general lists from the Web .
Visual information extraction approaches move the focus of the problem from the HTML and its corresponding DOM tree structure to a visual pattern recognition problem [ 2 , 4 ] . These visual based methods are still inadequate to be used for general list extraction . They tend to focus on subproblems , such as the extraction of tables where each data record contains a link to a detail page [ 3 ] , or discovering tables rendered from Web databases [ 4 ] ( deep web pages ) .

In this paper , we propose HyLiEn , a novel hybrid based approach for automatic discovery and extraction of general lists on the Web . Although there are already some works that pay attention on visual information on Web pages [ 2 , 4 ] and on the DOM structure of a Web page [ 6 , 1 , 7 ] , to the best of our knowledge , only a few methods use both visual and DOM information to perform Web list discovery [ 2 , 5 ] the most recent of which , VENTex [ 2 ] , is used in our case study for comparison .
2 . VISUAL STRUCTURAL METHOD
HyLiEn is primarily based on the visual alignment of list items , but it also utilizes non visual information such as the DOM structure and the size of visually aligned items . The result of the Web page rendering process can be regarded as a set of boxes . Figure 1(a ) and 1(b ) show an example of web page and box segmentated page . Each rendered box has a position and size , and can either contain content ( ie , text or images ) or more boxes . Generally , there is a box created for each DOM element . Starting from the box representing the entire Web page , usually the HTML tag , we recursively consider inner boxes , and extract lists boxes which are visually aligned and structurally similar to other boxes .
To extract lists on the basis of visual cues , the following basic assumption is made :
Definition 1 . A list candidate l = {l1 , l2 , . . . , ln} on a ren
A1A1_1A1_2A1_3A1_1_1A1_1_2A1_1_3A1_1_4A1_1_4A1_3_1A1_3_2A1_3_3A1_3_4A1_3_5A1_3_6A2A2_1A2_2A2_3A2_1_1A2_1_2A2_1_3A2_1_4A2_1_5A2_1_6A2_2_1A2_2_2A2_2_3A2_2_1_1A2_2_1_2A2_2_1_3A2_2_1_4A2_2_1_5A2_2_2_1A2_2_2_2A_2_2_3A2_2_2_4A2_2_2_5A2_2_3_1A2_2_3_2A2_2_3_3A2_2_3_4A2_2_3_5A2_2_3_6A2_3_1aA2_3_2aA2_3_3aA2_3_4aA2_3_1bA2_3_2bA2_3_3bA3A3_1A3_2A3_1_1A3_1_2A3_1_3A3_1_4A3_2_1A3_2_2A3_2_3A3_2_4WWW 2011 – PosterMarch 28–April 1 , 2011 , Hyderabad , India35 dered Web page consists of a set of vertically and/or horizontally aligned boxes .
As shown in [ 8 ] , this assumption alone is sufficient to outperform all existing list extraction methods . However , it does not cover Web pages such as the one in Figure 1(a ) where , all of the orange boxes inside Box A2 2 correspond to a single list in the page , but there are many pairs of elements in this list which are not visually aligned . Therefore , we extend the assumption in definition 1 as following :
Definition 2 . Two lists l and l are related ( l ∼ l ) if they have an element in common . A set of lists S is a tiled structure if for every list l ∈ S there exists at least one other list l ∈ S such that l ∼ l and l = l . Lists in a tiled structure are called tiled lists .
Three tiled lists ( A2 2 1 , A2 2 2 and A2 2 3 ) are shown in Figure 1(b ) . The notion of tiled list is useful to handle more problematic cases , such as A2 2 , by merging the individual lists of a tiled structure into a single tiled list .
Once visual aligned elements are extracted , we prune out false positives under the hypotheses that the DOM subtrees corresponding to the elements of the list must satisfy a structural similarity measure ( structSim ) to within a certain threshold α and that the subtrees not have a number of DOM nodes ( numN odes ) greater than a threshold β :
Definition 3 . A candidate list l = {l1 , l2 , . . . , ln} is a genuine list if and only if for each pair ( li , lj ) , i = j , structSim ( li , lj ) ≤ α , numN odes(li ) ≤ β , and numN odes(lj ) ≤ β .
This assumption , which is shared with most other DOMcentric mining algorithms , is made to determine whether the visual alignment of a certain boxes can be regarded as a real list or it should be discarded .
3 . EXPERIMENTS
HyLiEn requires two parameters which are empirically set to α = 0.6 and β = 50 . We used a subset of 100 pages from dataset used in VENTex[2 ] . This dataset is general and not biased ; we take advantage on this dataset to show that our method is robust and the result are not biased from the selected test set .

Table 1 : Recall for table and record extraction on the VENTex data set .
Table 1 shows that there are over 224 tables and 6146 data records in the ground truth.VENTex did extract 8 more tables than HyLiEn . We believe this is because HyLiEn does not have any notion of element distance that could be used to separate aligned but separated lists . Despite the similar table extraction performance , HyLiEn extracted many more records ( ie , rows ) from these tables than VENTex .
We did judge the precision score here for comparison sake ( see Table 2 ) . We find that , from among the 100 Web pages we achieve 99.9 % precision . VENTex remained competitive with a precision of 857 % We see that HyLiEn consistently and convincingly outperforms VENTex .

4 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper , a novel fully automatic hybrid approach for extracting Web lists from Web pages is presented . Experimental results show that it outperforms the existing approaches for Web lists and tables extraction . Interesting avenues for future work involve the usage of extracted lists to annotate and discover relationships between entities on the Web or to index the Web , the query answering from lists , and the entity discovery and disambiguation using lists .
