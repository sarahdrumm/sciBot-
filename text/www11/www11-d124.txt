ABSTRACT In this poster , we study the problem of Opinionated Blog Feed Retrieval which can be considered as a particular type of the faceted blog distillation introduced by TREC 2009 . It is a task of finding blogs not only having a principle and recurring interest in a given topic but also having a clear inclination towards expressing opinions on it . We propose a novel probabilistic model for this task which combines its two factors , topical relevance and opinionatedness , framework . Experiments conducted in the context of the TREC 2009 & 2010 Blog Track show the effectiveness of the proposed model .

1 . INTRODUCTION Opinionated Blog Feed Retrieval is a pilot task that can be defined as identifying blog feeds not only having a principle and recurring interest in the given topic but also having a clear inclination towards expressing opinions on it . Specifically , given a query , the system should provide a list of ranked opinionated relevant blog feeds . Those top ranked will be recommended to users for RSS subscriptions , and via this recommendation , users may track public opinions on their interesting topics in time . This task can be considered as a particular type of the faceted blog distillation introduced by TREC 2009[3 , 4 ] , and corresponds to the “ opinionated ” value for the “ opinionated ” facet . Responding to the requirements of the task , two factors should be considered for the blog ranking here : topical relevance and opinionatedness on the topic . Most existing approaches presented in TREC 2009 consider them separately , and perform in a twostage way : first generate a topical baseline regardless of opinionatedness , and next estimate opinionatedness to re rank the topical baseline with a heuristic manner . The opinionatedness estimation can be conducted with classification techniques or an opinion lexicon . However , in almost cases , when opinionatedness is considered , a decrease in performance is observed compared to the baseline [ 3 ] . This motives us to adopt a unified approach to combine both of the factors for this task. In this poster , we propose a probabilistic model for this task , and it has the following characteristics : 1 .
It combines topical relevance and opinionatedness on the topic in a unified probabilistic framework . The combination can be directly interpreted in a principled way , while most

2 . The opinionatedness is estimated topic dependently , which is embodied in two aspects : ( 1 ) first , for each topic , we construct a topic specific opinion model to represent the topic specific opinion expressions ; ( 2 ) second , for each blog , we measure topic sensitive weight of each word in the blog to reflect topic biased content characteristics .
3 . The model requires no training , and thus does not require manual labeling . Furthermore , it needs no additional external resource , but a general opinion lexicon . These points can minimize human labor .
We conduct experiments in the context of the TREC 2009 & 2010 Blog Track . The experimental results show that our model can remarkably improve the performance over topical baseline . to topical traditional generative model
2 . THE PROPOSED MODEL Our model aims to develop an effective function that ranks blogs relevance and opinionatedness . considering both According in Information Retrieval ( IR ) area , topical relevance can be estimated by its generation likelihood given the query Q , P blog Q . Following ( this generative model , for our task , we further consider opinionatedness . Thus we introduce the latent variable QO which indicates the topic specific opinion expressions , and rank blogs according to their generation probability given the query Q and QO , P blog Q O . Formally , ( P blog P Q blog P O Q blog P blog Q O ( ) ( , , ( | ) Q  ( 1 )

3 . TOPICAL RELEVANCE ESTIMATION Since ( P blog p Q blog deals with the topical relevance , it can be estimated by the existing approaches to topical blog feed search . In this poster , we adopt the Small Document ( SD ) model [ 1 ] . According to the SD model , each blog is considered as a collection of its constituent posts , and P blog p Q blog can be ( given as follows :

Our task only considers the “ opinionated ” value for the “ opinionated ” facet . There are totally 20 “ opinionated ” topics in TREC 2009&2010 Blog Track officially used for evaluation of this task ( including 13 topics for 2009 and 7 topics for 2010 ) . We use all these topics .

In Table 1 , Topical Baseline is the topical relevance component of P blog p Q blog ) ; Unified Model O uses the our model(ie , ( general opinion expressions O , which is assumed to be the general opinion lexicon with each opinion word uniformly distributed , instead of QO . Table 1 shows that the MAP improvements of our unified model over the Topical Baseline on 2009 and 2010 topics are 47.07 % and 27.9 % respectively . Besides , our unified model outperforms the best run for this task in TREC 2009 Blog Track , whose MAP value is 0.1295 on 2009 topics , by a large margin . The table also shows the performance benefits greatly from using QO compared to using O , which verifies the reasonability of modeling topic specific opinion expressions for this task . n o si ci e Pr e g a r e v A

We can observe the improvements over Topical Baseline on most topics ( 18 of 20 ) and no performance decrease on any topic , which indicates the stability of our model .

OPINIONATEDNESS ESTIMATION  estimates the opinionatedness on the topic , where QO can be represented as a language model(referred P w O is the probability of the word w to as ( P w Q blog is the probability of w given the blog and in QO LM ; ( ) the query Q , measuring the topic sensitive weight of w in the blog . 4.1 Estimating QO LM We beforehand collect a general opinion lexicon1 . Then , given a query Q , we can learn the QO LM as follows : ( 1 ) use the original query to retrieve the top N topically relevant posts from the TREC Blogs08 collection with the BM25 model ; ( 2 ) use all the general opinion words together as a query to re retrieve the top K posts as opinion feedback documents A from the top N topically , in our experiments , relevant posts retrieved in the step ( 1)( K K=30 , and N=15000 ) ; ( 3)use the Bol term weighting model [ 2 ] to assign a weight to each word in the vocabulary V , measuring how informative it is in A against the background collection(ie , Blogs08 collection in our experiments ) , to infer the probability of the word in the LM . The words with high probability in the LM should be topic related opinion words , or indicate controversial subtopics on which bloggers tend to express opinion . 4.2 Estimating By considering each blog as a collection of its constituent posts like SD model mentioned in Section 3 , we have :

Finally , for each word w , P w Q blog is calculated as the sum of ( its probability in the constituent posts , weighted by the post P w Q blog assigns topical relevance . Compared to ( ( more probability to the words more related to the topic to reflect topic biased content characteristics of the blog .
