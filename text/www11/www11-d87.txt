ABSTRACT Web entities , such as documents and hyperlinks , are created for different purposes , or intents . Existing intent based retrieval methods largely focus on information seekers’ intent expressed by queries , ignoring the other side of the problem : web content creators’ intent . We argue that understanding why the content was created is also important . In this work , we propose to classify such intents into two broad categories : “ navigational ” and “ informational ” . Then we incorporate such intents into traditional retrieval models , and show their effect on ranking performance . Categories and Subject Descriptors : H33 [ Information Storage and Retrieval ] : Information Search and Retrieval General Terms : Algorithms , Performance Keywords : web entity intent , query intent , retrieval model 1 Understanding users’ intent is important for search engines to better serve users’ information needs . Broder proposed a taxonomy for such intents , in which queries are classified into three categories : navigational , informational , and transactional [ 3 ] . While previous research showed that query intent classification can improve ranking performance , they ignored the connection to the intents of information providers when creating web content . As illustrated in Figure 1 , we argue that the intent behind every hyperlink can influence its importance to the target page , and thus affect ranking effectiveness . In this work , we propose to model the intent for which web pages and hyperlinks ( links for short ) are created , and incorporate such intent into ranking methods to show its usefulness .
Introduction
People create links for various reasons . In this brief work , we categorize links into two types : ( 1 ) navigational links : links that are created to describe the target page ’s identity ; and ( 2 ) informational links : links created to describe the target . For example , a link pointing to “ http://wwwfacebookcom/ ” with the anchor text “ Facebook ” is considered a navigational link since the anchor text is the proper name of that particular web site . A link with the same anchor text pointing to the Wikipedia page describing Facebook Inc . is an informational link . These two classes are not exclusive . We consider every link to be a soft combination of both . Similarly , we classify web pages into “ navigational intent pages ” ( pages that mostly attract navigational links ) and “ informational intent pages ” ( pages that mostly attract informational links ) . Our work is conducted in two steps : ( 1 ) classify links into the two intent classes ; ( 2 ) use the link classification result to generate better rankings . Our key contribution is to show the effect on ranking when incorporat

( a ) Page A is the home page of pandora music .
( b ) Page B is a blog discussing music on Site pandora music .
Figure 1 : Two pages have 101 inlinks , and 100 anchortexts contain pandora music . As a result , the contributions of anchor terms pandora music to A and B are indistinguishable without considering the page content and anchor text length . However , we claim that Page A should be emphasized when answering the navigational query “ pandora music ” , and the links with pandora music pointing to A are more navigational . ing the intents of the creation of web entities ( links and pages ) into retrieval models . 2 Link Intent Classification To incorporate link intent into ranking , the first step is to train a classification model to identify link intents . The approach is summarized below . Our extended report [ 5 ] has details .
Labels : Each anchor URL pair in the training set is labeled by human as either “ navigational ” ( positive class ) or “ informational ” ( negative class ) .
Features : The features for link intent classification include numerical features that quantify URL length and depth , anchor text length , statistics based on the Part Of Speech ( POS ) tags of anchor terms , eg , fractions of nouns , verbs , etc . ; as well as anchor entropy information , such as features of the entropy based H(Dat|at ) on anchor term distribution , defined as i(at ) = log |Dat| , where H(Dat|at ) = − . P ( d|at ) log P ( d|at ) represents the conditional entropy of the distribution on URL collection ( Dat ) associated with anchor term at . d∈Dat
Model : A SVM classifier based on LIBSVM [ 4 ] is trained using the labeled training set . Given an unseen pair , the model generates −→ the probability that its associated link has “ navigational intent ” . So each link l corresponds to a binomial intent distribution Il , with each item representing the probability that l has specific intent . Page intent distribution is the centroid of all its incoming link intent distributions , defined as 3 Using Entity Intents in Retrieval Models Given the web entity intent distribution , we next incorporate them into two representative retrieval models , ie , language model ( LM ) and BM25F [ 6 ] . While our intent taxonomy only includes two l∈Inlink(d )

We emphasize two aspects : ( 1 ) combining lexical similarity with intent similarity between queries and web pages ; and ( 2 ) incorporating intent similarity between incoming links and target pages into target page representation . Incorporating intent into LM : The probability that query q generates web page d is estimated by p(d|q ) = p(q|d)p(d ) , where p(d ) is constant for all pages since no page is more rele−→ vant than others for all queries . Each page d is represented by d =< Cd , Id > , where Cd is d ’s content . Assuming page content and intent are independent , p(d|q ) is given by : p(d|q ) = −→ Id|q ) where p(q|Cd ) is the query likelip(Cd , −→ Id|q ) is the probahood , a well studied factor in previous work . p( −→ −→ −→ bility that q generates a page with the same intent as d .

Incorporating intent into BM25F : BM25F linearly combines term frequencies in multiple page fields . The frequency of term t in page d ’s anchor field can be estimated by : wanchor(t , d ) = . w(a , d)tf ( t , a ) where w(a , d ) is the importance of anchor a to page d . When only considering anchor fields , d ’s term frequency is given by : w(t , d ) = ( 1 − α)wbody(t , d ) + αwanchor(t , d ) . Assuming the incoming links sharing similar intent distribution with target pages are more important , we incorpo−→ rate an intent similarity measure into anchor importance estimation by wfi Id )w(l , d ) .

The experiments are conducted on ClueWeb09 ( Category B ) data set , with 49.8M web pages and 940M links . We use the 50 queries in the Ad hoc task of the TREC 2009 Web track for evaluation .
To generate anchor target pairs for link intent classification , we first split 50 queries into 5 folds sequentially by query IDs . For each query , we collect its top 1000 documents by query likelihood . We randomly select 200 in links pointing to pseudo feedback documents in each fold as link intent instances ( no overlap between

Each instance is labeled by at least one worker of Amazon Mechanical Turk [ 2 ] , in selection among “ navigational ” , “ informational ” , “ none of them ” or “ both of them ” . We use only the instances labeled as “ navigational ” or “ informational ” for training . Table 1 shows the classification performance based on 5 fold CV . For ranking evaluation , we compare the retrieval models after incorporating link intents with the baselines , ie , LM and BM25F . statMAP [ 1 ] and Precision at truncation level k ( P@k ) are our main metrics . For language model experiments , the query likelihood is estimated by p(q|d ) = wi∈q p(wi|d ) . Dirichlet smoothing is used for p(wi|d ) estimation , with smoothing parameter μ being 2500 . For BM25F experiments , w(a , d ) is simply the number of times that anchor a points to document d . All methods are compared when the trade off parameter α equals 05 fi
The ranking performance comparison is shown in Table 2 . After incorporating web entity intents , both LM and BM25F outperform baselines on most metrics . It suggests that introducing a bias based on web entity intents helps improve retrieval quality . We attribute such improvements to a better connection among the intents of providers , recommenders and seekers of information . On BM25F , our approach can better improve the quality of top results , which is often of particular value in web search .
To better understand the effect of link intent on ranking , we intentionally introduce noise into link intent classification result by reversing Il of a fraction of randomly selected links and conducted 30 runs at each noise level . The average and deviation of ranking performance on P@10 is shown in Figure 2 . We observe that : ( 1 ) ranking performance decreases with the increase of noise ( note that the trends are approximately symmetric with respect to the noise level at 50 % since the retrieval models equally treat two types of link intents ) ; and ( 2 ) the retrieval models using Cosine similarity measure is more tolerant to noise .
In summary , we showed that incorporating web entity intents into retrieval models can improve retrieval quality . The improvements are sensitive to the accuracy of link intent classification .
