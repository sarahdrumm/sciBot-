ABSTRACT The present discussion highlights the aspects of an ongoing doctoral thesis grounded on the analysis and tracking of emotions from English and Bengali texts . Development of lexical resources and corpora meets the preliminary urgencies . The research spectrum aims to identify the evaluative emotional expressions at word , phrase , sentence , and document level granularities along with their associated holders and topics . Tracking of emotions based on topic or event was carried out by employing sense based affect scoring techniques . The labeled emotion corpora are being prepared from unlabeled examples to cope with the scarcity of emotional resources , especially for the resource constraint language like Bengali . Different unsupervised , supervised and semi supervised strategies , adopted for coloring each outline of the research spectrum produce satisfactory outcomes .

1 . INTRODUCTION Major studies on Opinion Mining and Sentiment Analyses have been attempted with more focused perspectives rather than finegrained emotions [ 1 ] . A wide range of Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) tasks such as tracking users’ emotion about products or events or about politics as expressed in online forums , to customer relationship management are using emotional information . Question Answering ( QA ) systems [ 3 ] and modern Information Retrieval ( IR ) [ 4 ] , [ 9 ] systems are also increasingly incorporating emotion analysis within their scope . Emotion analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker or a writer with respect to some topic [ 5 ] .

2 . PROBLEM Human machine interface technology has been investigated for several decades . Scientists have found that emotion technology can be an important component in artificial intelligence [ 6 ] . Recent research has placed more emphasis on the recognition of nonverbal information , and has especially focused on emotion reaction . Emotions , of course , are not linguistic things . However the most convenient access that we have to them is through the language to objective observation or verification is difficult to convey in text as it does not always contain any direct , specific or conclusive hints . Hence , we need a comprehensive theory of what a human emotion is , and then we need to understand how the emotion is expressed and transmitted within the natural language . These aspects raise the need of syntactic , semantic , and pragmatic analysis of a text [ 8 ] .

3 . STATE OF THE ART Started from beginning , characterization of the words and phrases according to their emotive tone was done [ 11 ] . The annotation of opinion and emotion related content of a language has been described in [ 3 ] . With respect to the traditional natural language domains such as News [ 15 ] , Blogs [ 16 ] are also becoming the popular , communicative and informative repository of text based emotional contents in the Web 20 Opinion mining at word , sentence and document levels and opinion summarization on news and web blog articles are discussed in [ 13 ] . In order to estimate the affects in text , the model proposed in [ 17 ] processes symbolic cues and employs NLP techniques for word , phrase and sentence level analysis . Several machine learning techniques were used on blog data to identify the mood of the authors during writing [ 16 ] . The text based emotion prediction using supervised machine learning based on the SNoW learning architecture is discussed in [ 12 ] . Most works cited above were carried out for English . Bengali is less privileged and less computerized than English . Thus , the language independent techniques are employed to develop and evaluate the systems for English and Bengali [ 32 ] . Some of the well known prior works in identifying opinion holders are described in [ 18 ] [ 19 ] . Based on the traditional perspectives , another work discussed in [ 20 ] uses an emotion knowledge base for extracting emotion holder . Though our adopted syntactic techniques are similar to the earlier attempts , the identification of emotion holders with respect to emotional verbs signifies the difference from others . In opinion topic extraction , different researchers contributed their efforts [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] . But , all these works are based on lexicon look up approach and applied on the domain of product reviews . A contributory topic annotation task on the MPQA corpus is
WWW 2011 – Ph . D . SymposiumMarch 28–April 1 , 2011 , Hyderabad , India343 described in [ 23 ] . In contrast , the incorporation of rhetorical structure , four similarity features and multi engine voting technique significantly identifies the individual topic spans from the focused target span [ 38 ] , [ 39 ] . Temporal Sentiment Analysis in Social Events has been studied in [ 14 ] . MoodViews also analyzes multiple sentiments [ 24 ] . Presently , an emotion tracking system is being developed [ 7 ] . Work using unlabelled data together with positive examples to predict the sentiment orientation of blogs is discussed in [ 25 ] . The preparation of labeled corpus from unlabeled data is being carried out to fulfill our partial research objectives .
4 . PROPOSED APPROACH Emotion analysis involves identifying the emotion holder , subject / topic / event detection on which emotions are expressed and classification of emotional / evaluative expressions at word / phrase / sentence / document level .
4.1 Classification of Evaluative Expressions The input documents can be analyzed to identify its sentiment orientation ( factual or emotion ) , the subject and aspects involved and the evaluation keywords of positive or negative sentiment type . The sentiment oriented documents can be decomposed to identify the fine grained Ekman ’s [ 26 ] six universal emotions ( eg happy , sad , anger , disgust , fear or surprise ) from different portions of the documents ( eg word , phrase or sentence ) . 4.2 Holder Identification An emotion holder is the person or organization that expresses the emotion [ 3 ] . In the case of product reviews and blogs , holders are usually the authors of the posts . Information about emotion holder is generally present in words or phrases with the semantic roles : experiencer , agent , actor , patient and beneficiary . The writer's and reader's emotion for a specific text is to be determined so that their underlying sense can be differentiated.  4.3 Subject Topic Event Detection There are other relevant effort could found in literature [ 27 ] . The proposal aimed to identify the subject , topic or event in a sentence on which the emotion is expressed . This information is necessary for tracking of emotions expressed on a particular subject / topic / event by a holder with respect to time . 4.4 Emotion Tracking Sometimes , the blog users comment on each other . The identification of such overlapped comments on a given topic is crucial for detecting emotion . This module aims to track a single user's comments on the same topic as well as on different topics to analyze the changes in emotion with respect to topic and time . Tracking of mass emotions on certain subject / topic / event over time will also be taken up in the proposed research . 4.5 Working with Unlabeled Data An important task in the present research will be the development of emotion annotated news stories and blog corpora in Bengali as these are important resources for analyzing emotions .
5 . METHODOLOGY The whole activities in the proposed research are centered on news and blog corpora . The methodologies will be language independent in nature with English , Bengali as for case study . The methodologies developed will be useful for news agencies , news reporters , sociologists , psychologists and common people in general . Descriptions of supporting resources and developed systems are as follows . 5.1 Resources 511 Lexical Resource We have two available sentiment resources , SentiWordNet [ 28 ] and WordNet Affect [ 10 ] in our present task . The collection of the WordNet Affect synsets [ 15 ] used in the present task was provided as a resource for the SemEval 2007 shared task of “ Affective Text ” [ 15 ] . Both of these resources are in English . Hence , the development of Bengali WordNet Affect Lists ( BengWAL ) has been carried out in four phases [ 31 ] . The first two phases , updation using SentiWordNet [ 28 ] and VerbNet [ 29 ] and translation through a synset based English to Bengali bilingual dictionary ( being developed as part of the EILMT project 1 ) are followed by a duplicate removal technique . The sense disambiguation algorithm [ 42 ] based on the similarity clue is applied on the translated Bengali synsets . Inter translator evaluation achieves the moderate agreement . incorporated
512 Corpus We have used two types of English corpus . One is the SemEval 2007 affect sensing corpus [ 15 ] which is a sentence level emotion annotated corpus containing only the news headlines . The scores for valence and six emotions are assigned to each of the sentences . Another one is an emotion annotated blog corpus [ 43 ] that contains a rich set of emotion information such as category , intensity and word or phrase based expressions at sentence level . Additionally , a manual effort has been made for annotating the topic and target spans in the blog corpus [ 43 ] . If an emotional verb present in the WordNet Affect [ 10 ] is found as a member verb of any VerbNet [ 29 ] class , the sentences corresponding to that class have been retrieved to construct the emotion corpus . This corpus has been only used for identifying emotion holders . To the best of our knowledge , there is no such available corpus annotated with detailed linguistic emotional expressions in Bengali or even in other Indian languages . Hence , an emotion annotated Bengali blog corpus has been developed manually [ 30 ] . Each sentence is annotated with the emotional components such as emotional expression ( word/phrase ) , intensity , associated holder(s ) and topic(s ) . Ekman ’s six emotions along with three types of intensities ( high , general and low ) were considered for sentence level annotation . Different types of fixed and relaxed strategies were agreement . Consequently , each of the 205 blog documents is annotated with single or multiple document level emotions for experiments [ 36 ] . 5.2 Identifying Emotional Expressions The system of identifying evaluative emotional expressions consists of four inter connected modules at different levels of
1 English to Indian Languages Machine Translation ( EILMT ) is a TDIL project undertaken by the consortium of different premier institutes and sponsored by MCIT , Govt . of India to measure employed the
WWW 2011 – Ph . D . SymposiumMarch 28–April 1 , 2011 , Hyderabad , India344 training and granularities such as word ( W ) , phrase ( P ) , sentence ( S ) and document ( D ) . The baseline system for word level emotion tagging has been developed to measure the performance with respect to each emotion class without integrating any prior knowledge of word features [ 32 ] . Each of the words of the corpus is passed through these six modules separately to tag with the appropriate class label . On the other hand , the Conditional Random Field ( CRF ) [ 44 ] and Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) [ 45 ] based machine learning classifiers are employed for word level emotion tagging [ 33 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . Different singleton features ( eg Part of Speech ( POS ) of the words , Question words , Reduplication , Colloquial / Foreign words , Special Punctuation Symbols , Negations , Emoticons etc. ) , context features ( eg unigram , bigram ) at word and POS tag level along with their different combinations are used for testing . Measuring the classifier ’s accuracy using confusion matrix , the equal distribution of emotion tags with the non emotion tag improves word level emotion tagging systems [ 32 ] . The assignment of sentence level emotion tags and scores based on the word level constituents is carried out using corpus based and sense based tag weights of six emotions [ 33 ] followed by post processing techniques for handling negations [ 32 ] . The baseline system at phrase level is developed based on WordNet Affect lists [ 10 ] and parsed dependency relations [ 40 ] . SVM based supervised framework is also employed by incorporating different word and context features . Information Gain based pruning , application of admissible tag sequences and a class splitting technique improves the system ’s performance by reducing the label bias problem of SVM . Phrase to sentence level emotion tagging is also mentioned in [ 40 ] . The document level emotion tagging from the emotion tagged sentences is carried out based on some combinations of heuristic features ( eg emotion tag of the title sentence or end sentence , emotion tags assigned to an overall topic , most frequent emotion tags expressed in user comment portions of a document , identical emotions that appear in the longest series of tagged sentences etc ) The best two emotion tags are assigned to each document based on the ordered emotion scores obtained [ 36 ] . 5.3 Holder Identification The baseline model ( BM ) for identifying emotion holder in English has been developed based on the subject information of the emotional sentences parsed using Stanford Dependency Parser [ 37 ] . Similarly , the Bengali blog sentences are passed through an open source Bengali shallow parser 2 that produces different morphological information ( eg root , case , vibhakti , tam , suffixes etc ) The lexical pattern based phrase level similarity clues containing different POS combinations , Name Entities ( NEs ) and noun phrases have been considered [ 41 ] . Another way to identify emotion holder is based on the syntactical argument structure of the emotional sentences . In English , the head of each chunk in the dependency parsed output helps in constructing the syntactic argument structure with respect to the key emotional verb . Two separate techniques have been adopted for extracting the argument structure [ 37 ] . One is from parsed result directly and another is from the corpus that has been POS tagged and chunked separately . Similarly , the verb based
2 http://ltrciiitacin/showfilephp?filename=downloads/shallow_p arser.php level argument structures are acquired from the chunk or phrase level lexical patterns of the shallow parsed Bengali blog sentences . The pivotal hypothesis considered in the syntactic model ( SynM ) is based on the hypothesis followed in [ 42 ] . But , the equivalent English verbs of identical sense for the Bengali verbs are retrieved using Bengali to English bilingual dictionary 3 . The available frames of the equivalent English verbs are extracted from English VerbNet [ 29 ] . For both English and Bengali , each acquired syntactic argument structure is mapped to all the possible frame syntaxes present for the corresponding verb in the VerbNet [ 29 ] . If the acquired syntactic argument structure of a sentence matches with any of the retrieved frame syntaxes of VerbNet , the holder roles ( eg Experiencer , Agent , Actor , Beneficiary etc . ) associated with the VerbNet frame syntaxes are then assigned in the appropriate slots in the syntactic arguments of the sentence [ 37 ] [ 41 ] . 5.4 Topic Identification The baseline topic identification model ( BM ) for English is developed based on the parsed constituents of the object related dependency parsed relations . Like emotion holder , the phrase segments containing topic related Thematic Roles ( eg Topic , Theme , Event etc . ) are extracted from the verb based syntactical argument structures of the sentences . On the other hand , a supervised model ( SvdM ) is adopted to identify multiple emotion topics along with their topic and target spans from each of the blog sentences [ 46 ] . CRF , SVM and Fuzzy Classifier ( FC ) [ 46 ] are employed by considering various features ( eg the annotated emotional expressions along with direct and transitive dependencies , causal verbs , discourse markers , Emotion Holder , Named Entities and four types of similarity measures like Structural Similarity , Sentiment Similarity , Syntactic Similarity and Semantic Similarity ) and their combinations . The incorporation of a special feature , Structural Similarity based on the Rhetorical Structure Theory [ 47 ] improves our system [ 38 ] . 5.5 Emotion Tracking Presently , tracking of sentiment events based on temporal relations in English [ 2 ] and tracking of emotion of Bengali bloggers [ 7 ] have been carried out successively . 6 . RESULTS Various experiments regarding symbolic feature , language , and domain dependent features were carried out for evaluating the word level emotion classification system [ 32 ] , [ 34 ] , [ 35 ] . The lexical feature ( eg POS , words of SentiWordNet and WordNet Affect ) outperforms other features significantly . Different combination of context features also significant improvement in performance . The word level tagging system has demonstrated the average F Scores of 83.65 % and 70.23 % on 1,500 word tokens on English news and Bengali blogs respectively [ 32 ] . The average F Scores of 65 % and 63.26 % on 200 test sentences were achieved for news and blogs in sentential emotion tagging . A supervised system for English blogs [ 43 ] outperforms the baseline system and achieves the average FScores of 82.72 % , 76.74 % and 89.21 % for emotional expressions , sentential emotions and intensities respectively on 565 gold standard test sentences [ 40 ] . shows

WWW 2011 – Ph . D . SymposiumMarch 28–April 1 , 2011 , Hyderabad , India345 The baseline model for English suffers in identifying emotion holders from the passive sentences . Though the recall value decreases , the syntactic model outperforms over baseline significantly in terms of F Score . The dependency parser based method achieves better F Score ( 66.98 % ) than the other method ( F Score of 62.39 % ) on a collection of 4,112 emotional sentences as the second method fails to disambiguate mostly the arguments from adjuncts [ 37 ] . The maximum average F Scores of the baseline and hybrid systems for emotion topic identification are 56.75 % and 58.88 % respectively on 500 sentences [ 39 ] . The supervised multi engine voting system achieves the F Scores of 70.51 % and 90.44 % for topic and target span identification respectively from the blog sentences [ 38 ] . For Bengali , the baseline system achieves the average F Scores of 53.85 % and 50.02 % for identifying emotion holders and topics respectively on 500 test sentences [ 41 ] . The average F Scores of the syntactic system are 66.03 % and 61.98 % for single as well as multiple emotion holders and topics on the same test set . But , the syntactic system suffers in resolving some errors ( eg appositive cases , co reference with emotional expression , multiple holders and topics , overlapping topic spans , anaphoric presence of the holders ) . Thus , some simple rule based error reduction techniques based on rhetorical structure , emotional expressions are employed into the syntactic system [ 41 ] .

7 . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK The information of emotional expressions , holders and topics acquired from the present systems are being embedded for other due systems . The resulting document level emotion tagger can be used in an emotion based Information Retrieval system . Since development of annotated data is time consuming and also prone to error , research efforts will be directed towards applying machine learning techniques that work with unlabeled data . Emotion analysis related to the effect of metaphors ( especially in blogs ) is another research area to be explored in future . 8 .
