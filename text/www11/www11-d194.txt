INTRODUCTION
Automating the understanding of sentiments expressed in online reviews could provide useful handles for designing marketing strategies , campaigns and promotions and be a vital component for the commercial success of products . A typical approach to binary sentiment analysis ( yes/no , good/bad , positive/negative ) is as follows . Turney[3 ] presented a rule based approach comprising three steps . First , word bigrams ( or phrases in general ) that are capable of holding sentiment expressions are extracted from the text based on the underlying POS ( part of speech ) patterns that are usually associated with such semantic orientations . In the second step , the orientation of the bigrams are estimated by computing their PMI ’s ( pointwise mutual information – a standard in IR applications– is indicative of the cooccurrence of a pair of words in a large corpus ) with strong polarity indicator words like excellent and poor . Finally ,

A review is categorized as positive or negative based on the overall score attained by the phrases in the review . The approach attains an accuracy of 66 % for movie reviews . In this work we explore the possibility of performing sentiment classification which does not require syntactic preprocessing like POS tagging and is essentially independent from the effects of incorrect language usage . In this context we consider stopwords as features for such classification . The remainder of the work is organized as follows . In section 2 we present the motivation for the present approach . Description of the experiments carried out and the results obtained are given in section 3 . We present our conclusions in section 4 .
2 . STOPWORDS AND SENTIMENTS
Stopwords are usually the non semantic words like articles , prepositions , conjunctions , pronouns etc . , they are numbered in hundreds whereas the size of English lexicon is of the order of hundreds of thousands of words . Also , stopwords are inevitable in usage and despite their small vocabulary they constitute a significant part of text thereby enabling a better estimation of their occurrence probabilities even with a small text corpus ( such computations for contentwords usually require orders of magnitude larger corpus ) . This provides the basic appeal to use stopwords as features to study text . Previously , stopwords have been used as features for stylometric purposes[2 ] and studying the distribution of stopwords is an established approach in author identification . Given that stopwords are endowed with enough discriminatory powers to enable author identification , we consider it a natural extension to view sentiment classification as a variation of the author identification problem : the authors here are sentiments!
3 . EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by applying it on a standard movie review dataset : Polarity Dataset
WWW 2011 – PosterMarch 28–April 1 , 2011 , Hyderabad , India137 V2.0 , available from Cornell University1 . The dataset contains positive and negative reviews , 1000 each . All nonEnglish characters are filtered out from these reviews as a basic cleanup operation . The overall methodology is as follows : the reviews –after suitable pre processing as explained below– are converted to topic vectors using Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA)[1 ] . LDA is a semantic clustering approach which views each document in a corpus as a mixture of topics generated by an underlying topic model ; words are probabilistically associated with topics ( number of topics is determined by the user ) and words relevant to a particular topic have a higher probability of getting generated under that topic . After computing topic vectors for each review in the movie review dataset , we train an SVM classifier with topic vectors from 800 reviews ; the accuracy of the classifier is tested with the remainder of the reviews ( 200 of them ) . In our experiments we used a Gibbs sampler based LDA implementation GibbsLDA++2 for computing the topic vectors for the review documents . The Support Vector Machine implementation LIBSVM 3 was used for classification . We use a standard list4 of 571 stopwords in our experiments . Note that one could extract stopwords based on word frequencies alone –choosing the top one percent of the most frequently occurring words in a corpus is one such possibility . Before presenting the results obtained with LDA and SVM , we first show the results of using stopwords and gaps –number of contentwords that occur between successive stopwords , this will be explained in more detail shortly– with a naive Bayes classifier in order to establish a baseline . We use the popular spam filter CRM114 5 for performing naive Bayes classification on positive and negative reviews . category positive negative accuracy
68 % ( 136/200 ) 60 % ( 120/200 )
Table 1 : Naive Bayes classifier : Stopwords & Gaps
Table 1 shows results obtained for 200 test documents in each category ( 800 in each were used for training ) . On the average , a baseline of 64 % is obtained with a straightforward classifier . This is very close to the results presented by Turney [ 3 ] . In the following , we show that our approach results in a marked improvement in accuracy over this baseline . To begin with , we show in Table 2 the results obtained by considering the entire review corpus as it is . With the observation that contentwords do not contribute to sentiment classification with LDA and SVM , we explore the efficacy of stopwords and gaps for the purpose of sentiment classification . As can be seen in any text , successive pairs of stopwords are separated by a sequence of contentwords . The length of these separations depend on the number of contentwords that occur between successive stopword pairs . In our experiments , we removed all the contentwords from the reviews and retained only the stopwords and gaps in the documents ( such document structures are facilitated by the bag of words model used by LDA ) . The documents contain

Table 2 : Effect of content words on accuracy
Table 3 : Effect of stop words and gaps on accuracy stopwords and gaps –represented by their integer values– that occur between immediate stopword pairs . For example , the previous sentence becomes : the 3 and 2 by 0 their 2 that 1 between 3 ; wherein {the , and , by , their , that , between} are considered as stopwords present in that sentence . Note that 0 captures bigram stopword occurrences without any contentwords in between ( as in by their ) .
The results obtained with this approach is shown in Table 3 . Significant improvement is observed in the accuracy of both positive and negative reviews . Peak accuracy is observed for both the review classes for 25 topics . This is a 10 % improvement over the baseline . We also note that experiments wherein the documents were formed only with stopwords ( without the inclusion of gaps ) failed to yield results better than the baseline ( results not shown ) . We also note that the dataset considered has almost similar distribution of gaps in both the positive and negative review categories indicating that the accuracy of the approach is a result of the combined usage of both these properties –stopwords and gaps . Overall , our results seem to suggest that stopwords along with the gaps , dictate the expression of review sentiments .
4 . CONCLUSIONS
The present approach is complementary to the conventional syntactic approaches for sentiment and opinion mining and hence a useful addition to the repertoire of opinion mining methods . Extending the approach from the present binary review classification ( positive or negative ) to perform more graded classifications ( star ratings for example ) would widen its applicability in sentiment analysis .
