Abstract
Based on analyzing the immune phenomena in nature and utilizing performances of ANN , a novel network model , ie , an immune neural network ( INN ) , is proposed which integrates the immune mechanism and the function of neural information processing . The learning algorithm of INN is mainly about the selection of an excitation function and an adaptive algorithm of the network . This model makes it easy for an user to directly utilize the characteristic information of a pending problem and to simplify the original structure through adjusting the excitation function with the prior knowledge , and then the working efficiency and the searching accuracy are both improved . The analysis in theory and the simulating test for the twin spiral problem show that , comparing with the artificial neural network , INN is not only effective but also feasible . INN can conducively simplify the structure of the existent model and show good working performances when dealing with a pending problem .
1 . Introduction the intelligent imitating
It is well known that the artificial neural network ( ANN ) has been an important research field of people exploring and information processing mechanism of brain neural system . However , it is also necessary for us to note that these existing neural network models are all based on understanding of natural neural system , and established by highly simplifying and abstracting its development and application in engineering practice , but losses some original functions of the natural system at the same time . With the development and wide spreading of ANN ’s applying , there continually appear some problems , such as the system is prone to plunging into locally extreme state when the learning algorithm is not selected suitably , there exists a conflict between the network complexity and its generalization and so on . this system , which is propitious to
From the deep analysis of the existing network models and algorithms , we can learn about that their methods of setting parameters lack the capability of meeting an actual situation , so that some torpidity appears when solving
Proceedings of the 2001 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM(cid:146)01 ) 0 7695 1119 8/01 $17.00 ' 2001 IEEE problems , which is conducive to the universality of the structure or algorithm but neglects the assistant function of the characteristics or knowledge . The loss due to the negligence is sometimes considerable in dealing with some complex problems . Based on this consideration , this paper aims at introducing the concept of immunity into some existing artificial neural networks , so as to design a novel network model which can use the characteristic knowledge for solving problem . This model is presently called immune neural network ( INN ) and it is used for improving the capability of dealing with some difficult problems .
2 . The Immune Neural Network Model
In the existing ANN models , an neuron is regarded as a unit which sums all the input signals at first , and then generates a output signal after comparing with a threshold . Distinctive features of this kind of models denote that they have simple structures and good versatility . However , these features simultaneously bring out a lack that they are not considered the active and assistant functions of characteristic information when dealing with a concrete problem . To be exact , there is no interface in these existing models . Based on this consideration , an vaccinating unit is designed in a novel model presented in this paper , which is used for utilizing characteristic information and prior knowledge to a pending problem , so as to improve the power of solving a concrete problem .
On designing this model , an neuron is firstly considered to take an important action during information processing , and secondly , all the neurons are similar in basic properties , but different in idiographic forms . Therefore , the excitation function of an neuron should be designed as an variable form . To be exact , basic properties of the function keep unchanged , but its concrete form can be changed through adjusting some of its parameters . To be more exact , the excitation function of any neuron i can designed as the following form , ie ,
= u i f X V i

( 1 ) where , fi( . ) is a function family with a series of parameters V , and selections of a concrete function form and the concerned parameters have something to do with the pending problem , which is different from the fact that an excitation function of original models is usually selected as an universal threshold form or S form . On the other hand , some features of the pending problem are contained in the information processing layer , therefore , the structure of this kind of network is usually more simple , and so as to make the time for network learning short and speed increased .
Taking an immune neural network with one hidden layer for example , suppose the weight matrixes of input layer to hidden layer and hidden layer to output layer are respectively W(1 ) and W(2 ) , then the output vector Y is :

For the purpose of convenient operation , the gradientdescending method is used for network training . During the training process , for smoothing learning path and increasing learning speed , a synthetic approach of training group by group and the adding momentum items should better be used . In which , the training method group by group is proposed mainly for aiming to the method one by one , and used for increasing the training speed . It first adds all the modifying values produced by a group of samples , and then makes a modification for one time . The method of adding momentum items denotes using the modifying value produced by the former step to smooth the learning path , so as to avoid getting into local extremum . To be exact , the equation of modifying weight W and parameter V is shown as follows :  ( )  t   ]    where , α and β are all the momentum factors , and η(i ) and µ(i ) are learning rates . It is necessary to point that effect of the learning ratesη(i ) and µ(i ) is relatively evident during the training process . If η(i ) and µ(i ) are great , then the training process is more prone to convergence , but oscillation the beginning of training , η(i ) and µ(i ) are usually set great values , and then are decreasing with the training process .

In actual test , we study the capability of INN with an example of the twin spiral classification . At first , we generate 640 points with random noise which respectively belong to two spiral lines ρ1 and ρ2 ( 320 points per each ) . Where , the angular velocities of the two spiral lines are

We select alternately half of the sample points for the training data , the rest are used for the testing data . Finally , we use MatLab5.3 for programming and operate it on a Pentium 233 PC . When the trained network is used for classifying the testing data , there are 7 points in summon which are classified in error , and the correct distinguish ratio is 9781 % If without noise , then the correct distinguish ratio is 100 % , which is highly improved form what is reported in the references [ 3 ] and [ 4 ] .
