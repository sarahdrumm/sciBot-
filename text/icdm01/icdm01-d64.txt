Abstract
In this paper we consider the question of uncertainty of detected patterns in data mining . In particular , we develop statistical tests for patterns found in continuous data , indicating the significance of these patterns in terms of the probability that they have occurred by chance . We examine the performance of these tests on patterns detected in several large data sets , including a data set describing the locations of earthquakes in California and another describing flow cytometry measurements on phytoplankton .
Keywords : Data mining , pattern detection , local structure , uncertainty , significance tests
Introduction
1
Data mining is the process of seeking structures in large data sets ( Hand et al , 2000 ; Hand , Mannila and Smyth , 2001 ) . Such structures have been divided usefully into the large and small scale . Large scale structures , summarising global features of a data set , are often called models ; model building has been the focus of statistical investigation over many decades . Small scale structures , typically referring to structures that are local in the space of measured variables , are called patterns . Pattern detection as an area of formal investigation is a relatively recent development – unlike model building , which could be developed for hand application on small data sets , the search procedures implicit in pattern detection required the advent of the computer . Tools for pattern detection have been developed in parallel in several areas , including association rule analysis , genomic sequence analysis , clickstream analysis , and fraud detection . Such has been the rate of progress in these areas – driven by urgent commercial and scientific needs – that many pattern detection algorithms have been developed . However , detecting a pattern is but the first step . A vital subsequent question , once a potential local structure has been flagged as of interest , is that of whether the pattern represents some real underlying aspect of the data generating mechanism , or is merely a feature of chance fluctuation in the data which happen to have been observed . It is this question that is the focus of the present paper . In particular , we describe significance tests for patterns . We do not pretend that our method provides the definitive answer to the question of uncertainty in pattern detection ; however , we demonstrate a statistical approach that contributes a practical solution to this problem .
Patterns are variously described in the literature . Broadly speaking , for our purposes a pattern may be defined as a recurring configuration of features describing the objects under investigation . The recurrence may be in different objects ( eg anomalous sequences of credit card transactions ) , or may be at different positions in the feature set describing a given object ( eg a nucleotide sequence in DNA ) . We adopt a definition that subsumes these and other definitions . We define a pattern as a data vector identifying an anomalously high local density of objects ( Hand , Blunt , Kelly and Adams , 2000 ; Adams , Hand , and Till , 2001 ) . This definition can be applied to most data types , from temporal sequences to static databases , provided some metric measuring the similarity of objects can be defined .
The algorithm that we use to find local peaks of probability density is that described in Adams , Hand , and Till ( 2001 ) ( and which we now call the PEAKER algorithm: ) . This algorithm finds estimates of the probability density of the data at each of the objects , and then examines each object in turn , to see if it lies at a local peak of the probability density function ( pdf ) . To illustrate , take an arbitrary object P . A local region is defined about P , in terms of the L closest objects to P . These L closest objects to P are examined to see if any of them has a higher estimated pdf than the estimate at P . If none do – if the pdf estimate at P is larger than that at any of its L nearest neighbors – then object P lies at a local pdf peak or mode . The algorithm requires the specification of the method for estimating the probability density and the choice of L . In fact , of course , any monotonic transformation of the pdf estimate will do – we are not concerned with the absolute values , but only their relative size . Taking advantage of this invariance , we use the reciprocal of the average Euclidean distance from P to its k nearest neighbors as our estimate . Adams , Hand , and Till ( 2001 ) describe some experiments on choice of k and L . In the examples described below , we set k independently of L , but quite small relative to the size of the data set , as we do not want to miss any structure in low density regions of the data . However , any values other than the ones we use , or indeed , any other choice of method of pdf estimation , could be used without affecting our method of significance testing , which does not depend on this choice .
Once we have detected these modes , we wish to know whether they are true patterns , or simply artefacts of random error in the data . That is , we want to attach a measure of statistical significance to a mode such that we can provide evidence that this mode is a pattern . To do this , we apply statistical tests under the null hypothesis that the data are locally uniform and identify departures from this hypothesis that indicate ‘peakedness’ in the density . This tells us the probability that we would get such a configuration if the data were uniform , with the alternative that the data are ‘peaked’ and thus a pattern . We describe three different test statistics , and discuss features of these tests and their implementation
2 Distributional Assumptions
PEAKER identifies local modes of probability density . The question we now want to answer is whether such a mode is likely to have arisen if the background distribution ( in the region covered by the L nearest objects to the mode ) is uniform . We thus define test statistics measuring departure from uniformity and derive their distributions . In particular , since we are interested in alternative hypotheses that favour leptokurtosis ( peakedness ) , our test statistics are measures of leptokurtosis . The result of such a test will be a significance value indicating the probability of observing such an extreme measure of leptokurtosis if the underlying distributions were truly locally uniform . It will be immediately apparent that issues of multiple testing will complicate the conclusions . We discuss these issues below .
Since our basic mode finding algorithm is based on nearest neighbor methods , we also use such concepts to define our test statistics . Nearest neighbor methods have been used for clutter removal in spatial point processes ( Byers and Raftery , 1998 ) , but not as yet for assessing the significance of the features that they leave behind . In particular , when defining our tests , we summarize the distances of the L nearest objects to the mode using measures such as means and medians . The distributions of these can be evaluated under the null hypothesis of uniformity , and we can compute the probability of observing values as extreme as those we do observe ( in fact , in the case of the mean and median , this translates into the probability of observing values as small as those we do observe ) . We give the details below . First , however , it is useful to establish some distributional machinery .
Suppose we have a continuous multivariate data set with dimensionality d ( ie d variables ) . The volume , RV , of a d dimensional hypersphere of radius R is given by :
V

We are ultimately interested in the distribution of the distances of objects from the center of this hypersphere when these objects are uniformly distributed within a hypersphere of radius R . However , this distribution is easier to derive if we first define a variable based on volumes . Draw an object from a uniform distribution over the hypersphere of radius R , and let V be the random variable defined as the volume of a hypersphere with same center as the original hypersphere and radius the distance from the center to the object . The probability density function for V can be written as :
Pr( vV

We can also see that will come in useful when formulating significance tests . Remember that in these formulations R is a constant and not a random variable .
3 Significance Tests
Suppose that we have a sample of n objects within a d dimensional hypersphere of radius R ; that is , we have n random variables , the objects from the center of the hypersphere , from which we obtain the corresponding functions of X , previous section . We now seek test statistics for departure from uniformity that highlight high density towards the center of the hypersphere .
3.1 Mean of 1Y The mean of 1Y , is calculated by the equation ; however , the distribution of 1Y is not easily obtained . Finding the distribution of the sum of Beta distributions is a hard problem as the probability and moment generating functions cannot be characterized in a closed form and so cannot be used to derive the distribution of 1Y . We choose instead to use Central Limit Theorem results to characterize the distribution as an approximate normal distribution . Hence representing the distances of

If there is a region of high density around our object point , then M will be smaller than we would expect than if the data were uniformly distributed on the hypersphere . We can compare values of M with the lower tail probabilities of the Beta distribution for appropriate values of n .
Note : We replace n with ( L 1 ) in all of these tests to obtain significance tests for modes detected by PEAKER with the radius , R , of the local region defined as the distance to the Lth nearest neighbor . The null hypothesis is valid for the ( L 1 ) nearest neighbors , given our choice of R .
4 Edge Effects
Situations in which the ranges of the variables have sharp cut off values , or which have clusters of objects with sharp edges , can cause difficulties . Our tests are based on the null hypothesis that the modes being tested are at the center of hyperspheres containing objects generated from a uniform distribution . This null hypothesis led us to deduce the form for the distribution of the distance of objects from the central mode . Unfortunately , if the hypersphere is centerd near a sharp edge , the distribution of the distance of objects from its center no longer has the same distribution ( the further objects are taken from a distorted distribution ) . In such situations , if we were to apply the significance tests to every object , there would be artificially inflated values of the k nearest neighbor distance due to edge effects , something that is commonly seen with nearest neighbor methods in spatial statistics . This means that objects near the boundaries of a cluster or a region will have artificially deflated values of the significance statistics and these boundary objects will appear more significant than they actually are . We can illustrate this with a data set containing 10,000 objects uniformly and independently distributed over [ 1,1]5 . Figure 1 shows 2Y statistic with those objects with a significance level of 0.05 % after applying the L=100 nearest neighbors .

The concentrations of objects at the corners of the plot show that edge effects are particularly evident here . In spatial statistics , there are many approaches to coping with these edge effects . One solution is a toroidal wrap around of the data such that no object is , in effect , on an edge . This is a practical solution but not so easy to justify in higher dimensions . We also note that a object on the edge of a cluster will display edge effects that will not be removed by a wrap around of the whole data set . For example , in Figure 2 we have a data set in two dimensions with 10,000 objects uniformly distributed over four unit squares . Figure 3 shows the objects significant at the 1 % level after the toroidal wrap around has removed edge effects . y

2Y statistic and thus appear The central edges have artificially deflated values of the more significant , whereas the outside edge effects have been ( mostly ) removed . This edge effect increases greatly with increasing dimension and increasing numbers of objects .
We note that objects that are precisely on an edge or a corner are not necessarily affected by edge effects . In this case , the nearest neighbors all lie in a volume arc of the hypersphere centered at the object in question . Within this arc , the assumptions of the distribution of the radius still hold . However , an object a short distance from the edge will have nearest neighbors in a small radius sphere , but next nearest neighbors only on one side ( see Figure 4 ) , thus artificially reducing the mean nearest neighbor distance . This is why one approach to edge correction in spatial statistics is to examine only those objects within a ‘guard area’ such that edge effects are not encountered .

5 Correction of Significance Values for Multiple Testing
We have already mentioned the fact that significance values will be affected by multiple testing due to the large number of peaks explored . However , the first correction we must make arises because any objects selected by PEAKER are by definition extreme within their local region ; these objects have a higher density than their L nearest neighbors . Consequently , we can say that such an object is more likely to be a pattern ( or ‘peak’ ) than these L nearest neighbors , and thus more likely to have more extreme values of the test statistic than these L neighbors . A high local density is implied by small nearest neighbor distances , especially as these tests are functions of the local density . The statistical tests that we have discussed will only provide us with correct significance values if we apply them to a randomly selected object , so we must correct for the extremeness of each mode .
In our tests we are interested in small values of the statistic and so we want the distribution of the minimum of L+1 realizations of the statistic . If the test statistic in question , then the CDF of the minimum of a sample of ( L+1 ) of these statistics is given by :

2Y , finding that is thus a conservative estimate of the CDF .
Of course , the underlying assumption in this distributional result is that the objects are independent and identically distributed . Unfortunately , this assumption of independence will not necessarily be true as our tests are all functions of the other L objects in the sample , which will be more dependent the closer an object is to the ‘peak’ object .
For example , we find that an object is a peak amongst its 50 nearest neighbors and we apply test . This would suggest statistical significance at the 1 % level ; however , taking into account the multiple testing aspect , we have F min
When we run the PEAKER algorithm for a certain value of L we will often identify more than one peak . We need to take into account all of these peaks when performing statistical tests ; that is , we must account for the effects of multiple testing once again . This time , however , the correction depends on the number of peaks that PEAKER identifies . Suppose we identify P peaks , then the adjusted value of the CDF for the test statistic is given by

For this result we assume that peaks are distributed independently of each other .
If we set PEAKER to search through multiple values of L , we encounter more multiple testing problems that are harder to account for , as issues of independence are less clear . The consideration of how this variation of L affects the test statistics is continuing work .
6 Choice of Tests
The significance tests available to us are :

The combination of the PEAKER algorithm with the statistical tests is referred to from here on as PEAKER+ ( PEAKER Plus ) .
7 Results
We ran PEAKER+ on two artificial and two real data sets . The first artificial data set , Art1 , consists of 2,000 objects generated from a uniform distribution on U appended with 50 objects from a multivariate normal distribution :

These added objects constitute a peak above the background noise of Art1 , although it is not clear from the plot whether the peak is significantly different from the background noise . We set ‘medium’ and ‘large’ peaks ; note that the smaller value of L was set to equal the number of objects in the peak and the medium value was set at twice the number of objects in the peak . We also employed the toroidal wrap around to remove edge effects . and 200 to represent ‘small’ ,

No peaks were identified as being significant at anything more extreme than the 99 % level , which is reassuring for a data set consisting entirely of random noise . The same experiment was run on Art2 and results shown in Table 2 .
Similar results to those for Art1 were obtained for L = 50 , but the peak is recognized at L = 100 with a significance level of approximately 0.004 % for the mean test and 0.07 % for the median test . The peak is less significant at the L = 200 level , and the median test suggests that there is not enough evidence here to suggest that the peak is not a feature of random variation in the data . As we include more objects in the test region , so the peak becomes more likely to have arisen through some random effect in the data . The object identified as a peak with L = 100 had co ordinates ( 0300,0308 ) to 3 significant figures , showing that the pattern has been correctly identified . No other objects flagged as peaks in Art2 were found to be significant different from a uniform distribution under the tests .
The Quakes data set consists of the longitude and latitude measurements of all 2,049 earthquakes with Richter intensity above 2.5 in California , USA recorded between 1962 and 1981 . Patterns found here may indicate an unusually high density of earthquakes in a local region , as opposed to earthquakes that occur randomly in the region . Again , we set k = 20 but this time we varied L over smaller values than those we used in the artificial data sets in order to find peaks with smaller support . The number of peaks significant at the 5 % level found by PEAKER+ for these parameter values on the Quakes data is shown in Table 3 .

The following plots show peaks significant at the 5 % level for the together with their local regions for L = 25 ( Figure 6 ) and L = 50 ( Figure 7 ) . The coloured triangles with white centers represent peaks significant at the 5 % level . These peaks are surrounded by a coloured circle representing their local region as defined by the Lth nearest neighbor distance ; the different sized local regions reflect the densities of objects in different areas . The coloured circles with white centers represent peaks found by PEAKER+ that are not significant at the 5 % level ; we have little evidence to suggest that these patterns are not simply the result of random fluctuation in the data .
The value of L is an indication of the level of support for a pattern , so our choice of L reflects the pattern size if a peak is flagged as being significant . In Figure 6 , many peaks are flagged but only a few are significant . In some cases , peaks that look like they should be patterns are not significant ( for example , the upper left peak ) . They are not significant for this level of L ; however , this is not to say that they will not be significant at some other level of L . We see in Figure 7 , that the upper left peak is now significant , whereas the three significant peaks on the left hand side in Figure 6 are not significant for L = 50 . By eye , we can sometimes find objects that look like they are not features of random variation , but by applying PEAKER+ we can find peaks and assess their significance for particular values of L , also identifying patterns that the naked eye may miss . e d u l t i t a

The Crpret1 data set is made up of five ( standardized ) measurements on each of 10,000 phytoplankton cells through analytical flow cytometry . These measurements are forward light scatter ( FSC ) , 90° light scatter ( SSC ) , depolarized/horizontally polarized light scatter ( FL1 ) , orange fluorescence ( FL2 ) and red fluorescence ( FL3 ) ( see Collins and Krzanowski ( 2001 ) for more details ) . Patterns here may indicate small groups of phytoplankton with unusual characteristics .
We set k = 20 and recorded results for L = 25 , 50 and 100 , to discover small patterns in the data . Results in Table 4 suggest that there are 2 significant peaks at the 5 % level for L = 50 and that either one or both of these peaks are also significant for L = 30 , depending on which test we use . No peaks are significant at the larger L = 100 level .

A scatterplot matrix ( Figure 8 ) appears to confirm the presence of these two patterns in the data . The dense cluster to the top of the FL3 axis ( 9909 objects ) contains no small significant patterns within it , something that we have no way of knowing simply by looking at the plot .
8 Conclusion
The main parameter of interest in the statistical tests for PEAKER+ is the number of nearest neighbors , L , that define the local region . We have seen that patterns are significant for some values of L but not for others and we realize that it is tempting to vary L until a ‘most significant’ value is reached . However , we reiterate that this action renders the significance tests meaningless in their current form , as we must once again account for multiple testing to obtain valid significance values . Increasing the number of multiple tests requires accurate tail probability estimates that are increasingly sensitive to error . We are currently investigating an approach that would allow such variation of L .
We observed differences in significance values between results for the mean and median test over all data sets , especially as L increased . This is due to the different distributions of the statistics . The distribution of has a larger variance and median

( 2Y

( 2Y median
) would be more robust to edge effects . but the estimates themselves
2Y . Estimates of the significance levels for peaks heavier tails than the distribution of are thus generally more conservative for have greater variance . However , for large values of L an estimate of the significance value using
In a setting where we are analysing spatial data , such as the Quakes data above , we may also be interested in patterns over certain geographical areas . A possibility here would be to define the local region by area rather than by support . However , since the density of objects often varies considerably over different areas , the significance tests will consider different numbers of objects for each peak . It is not clear whether we can account for multiple testing in the same way when we consider this inconsistency . If this can be overcome then such an approach can be useful for spatial data . However , we feel that varying the local region according to L , and thus the support of a peak , is more easily transferred to multivariate data and thus has wider application .
Of course , others have also developed statistical tests for patterns – though , as we noted in the introduction , the field is a relatively new one . Most other work appears to be based on computing the probability of the occurrence of patterns when the features are categorical . Examples , in a genomic context , are given in Atteson ( 1998 ) and Tompa ( 1999 ) . Our work generalizes this , permitting approximate matches and continuous data . In summary , PEAKER+ is a data mining algorithm that provides the answer to the most important question we should ask ourselves whenever we discover patterns in data containing any element of uncertainty : are these patterns real ?
