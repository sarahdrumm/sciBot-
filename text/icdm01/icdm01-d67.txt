Our approach
We propose a new methodology for visualizing association mining results . Inter item distances are computed from combinations of itemset supports . The new distances retain a simple pairwise structure , and are consistent with important frequently occurring itemsets . Thus standard tools of visualization , eg hierarchical clustering dendrograms can still be applied , while the distance information upon which they are based is richer . to general association mining applications , as well as applications involving information spaces modeled by directed graphs , eg the Web . In the context of collections of hypertext documents , inter document distances capture the information inherent in a collection's link structure , a form of link mining . We demonstrate our methodology with document sets extracted from the Science Citation Index , applying a metric that measures consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets .
1 . Introduction the
In some respect , the World Wide Web is like a vast library without an index system . Search engines are thus critical in finding Web pages of interest . Traditionally , search engines rank their results according to how well pages match keywords in the user query . In contrast , more innovative search engines such as Google [ 1 ] first perform a keyword search , and use results from prior analyses of the structure of Web hyperlinks to generate page ranks , independent of user queries for the selected pages . However , the results for these link based search engines are still displayed as ranked lists , just as for traditional search engines .
Simple linear lists cannot adequately capture many of the complex hyperlink relationships among Web pages . Techniques from the field of information visualization can help in this regard , making complex relationships more readily understandable . Visualization augments serial language processing with eye/brain parallel processing . Thus , the goal of visualization techniques is to enable users to recognize patterns in Web link

Previous approaches in this area have typically analyzed Web hyperlinks directly to determine page relationships [ 2 ] , or have relied on measures of similarity that only consider joint referencing of pairs of pages . The approach proposed in this work relies instead on measures of similarity that exploit sets of pages of arbitrary cardinality . In particular , the similarity among a set of pages is based on the number of other pages that jointly link to them . in introduced co citations ,
The proposed similarity measures are inspired by the concept of classical information retrieval in the context of citations appearing in published literature [ 3 ] . Co citations reduce complex citation or hyperlink graphs to simple scalar similarities between documents or Web pages . Co citation based similarities allow the direct application of standard tools developed in other areas of science , such as cluster analysis [ 4 ] . in
Similarity among objects by common reference has recently received some attention the form of association mining [ 5 ] . While they are not usually recognized as such , what are defined as itemsets in association mining can be interpreted as generalized cocitations . Similarities between pairs of documents in cocitation analysis can be generalized to reflect the impact of sets of documents of arbitrary , larger cardinality that are jointly cited . Thus , itemsets are interpreted as higher order co citations .
This work is the first known application of association mining to the visualization of link structures . Important ( frequently occurring ) higher order itemsets are often obscured by the mere pairwise treatment of traditional co citation analysis . The approach we take here involves the discovery of frequently occurring itemsets of arbitrary cardinalities , and the assigning of importance to them according to their support frequencies .
In a collection of itemsets , pairs of itemsets can overlap , so that there is a combinatorial explosion in the numbers of sets the user has to potentially deal with . We propose a novel approach to the problem of presenting results of association mining to users , which involves embedding higher order co citations ( itemset supports ) into pairwise document similarities . This hybrid of pairwise and higher order similarities greatly reduces the complexity of user interaction , while being significantly more consistent with higher order co citations than standard pairwise similarities . It also admits the application of fast algorithms developed for data mining , which are empirically known to scale linearly with problem size [ 6 ] . the section
The next augmented dendrogram introduces our higher order generalization of co citations , and describes how they can be included in inter document distances . Section 3 then proposes clustering visualization for information retrieval , and demonstrates the effects of our new distances on the dendrogram . In Section 4 , we define a metric that measures consistency between clusters and frequently occurring itemsets , and apply the metric to a number of test cases with real world data extracted from a literature citation database . Section 5 then summarizes our work and highlights its conclusions .
2 . Distances from Itemset Supports
Hyperlink systems , eg the World Wide Web or science citations , can in general be modeled as directed graphs . A graph edge from one document to another indicates a link from first to second . It is convenient to apply a matrix formulation for the development of linkbased document distances . for actual implementation this leads to the direct application of matrix data structures and operations usually found in programming languages . fact ,
In
In the matrix formulation , a binary adjacency matrix is formed that corresponds to the linkage graph . We take the convention that adjacency matrix rows are for citing documents and columns are for cited documents . Thus for adjacency matrix A , element indicates that document i cites document j , and is the lack of citation . jia , jia ,

A co citation between two documents is the citing ( or hypertext linking ) of the two documents by another one [ 3 ] . A measure of similarity between a pair of documents is the number of documents that co cite the pair . This is known as citation count . Taken over all pairs of documents , the co citation count similarity serves as a compact representation of citation graph structure .
A central component in classical citation analysis is clustering based on co citations as a measure of similarity . In the case of co citations , an association is made between two documents according to the number of times they are co referenced , ie through hypertext links or literature citations . The purpose of clustering is to form larger sets of documents that are more strongly associated with one another than they are to documents outside the cluster . clustering , because of
Traditional citation analysis typically applies single linkage lower computational complexity [ 7 ] . But because of its very weak clustering criterion , single linkage can have problems unless the data are inherently well clustered . Given the improved performance of modern computing machines , it becomes feasible to apply stronger clustering criteria in citation analysis . its
For the stronger clustering criterion of complete linkage , all similarities for the three pairs need to exceed the threshold before the documents constitute a single cluster . But it is still possible to construct cases in which there is not even one document that cites all of the clustered documents simultaneously . The completelinkage criterion is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the simultaneous citing of all documents in a cluster .
We propose a generalization of the co citation similarity in which sets of cardinality above two are considered for co citation . That is , we defin e a similarity among a set of cited documents that is based on the number of times all the members of the set are simultaneously cited . Because the similarity is among more than two documents , we consider it to be higher order than pairwise .
In our matrix formulation , itemset supports are computed for sets of columns ( cited documents ) of the adjacency matrix , just as they are computed for pairs of columns in computing co citation counts . For itemset I of cardinality I , whose member documents correspond to columns

A central problem in data mining is the discovery of frequent itemsets . In the context of hypertext systems , such frequent itemsets represent groups of highly similar documents based on higher order co citations . But managing and interacting with itemsets for information retrieval is problematic . Because of the combinatorially exploding numbers of itemsets and their overlap , user interaction becomes unwieldy .
  ( cid:229 ) ( cid:213 ) ( cid:229 )
Also , standard tools of analysis and visualization such as clustering assume an input matrix of pairwise distances . Mathematically , distances for all document pairs correspond to a fully connected distance graph . But the generalization to higher order distances means that the distance graph edges are generalized to hyperedges , that is , edges that are incident upon more than two vertices . It is difficult to generalize clustering algorithms to such distance hypergraphs .
Our approach to this problem is to apply standard clustering algorithms , but with pairwise distances that include higher order co citation similarities . The new distances we propose are thus a hybrid between standard pairwise distances and higher order distances . For information retrieval visualization , users need only deal with disjoint sets of items , rather than combinatorial explosions of non disjoint itemsets . The approach is designed such that member documents of frequent itemsets are more likely to appear together in clusters .
We extend the standard model by computing document similarities from higher order support features by summing supports over all itemsets that contain the document pair in question . More formally , the itemset support feature summation is s

This yields the similarity k , where transformation We [ ]I ( ) T z before summation . The transformation T is super linear ( asymptotically increasing more quickly than linearly ) , so as to favor large itemset supports . The hybrid similarity kjs , then becomes

A for approach straightforward reducing computational complexity for hybrid pairwise/higherorder distances is to exclude itemsets whose supports fall below some threshold value , denoted minsup . The worstcase complexity of the problem of finding all frequent itemsets is exponential . But algorithms have been proposed that empirically scale linearly with respect to both the number of transactions and the transaction size [ 6 ] . We then simply exclude from the summation in ( 1 ) all itemsets with supports

We have derived a theoretical guarantee for the nonlinear transformation of itemset support features in the similarity computation . In the discussion below , we provide a sketch of this theoretical result . It begins with a proof that the most frequent itemset can always be made a cluster , given a large enough degree of nonlinearity in the transformation . The proof relies on the transformation = in ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) , as T the degree of nonlinearity p increases , with a ( )z larger z with a smaller z . Since the term with largest z asymptotically dominates the distance summation , the result is that documents in the most frequent itemset are asymptotically closer to one another than to any other documents , thus forming a cluster .
( )z is asymptotically bounded from below by for a super linear of itemset supports z that ( )p ;z pT pT p
We then generalize the proof to cover the clustering of arbitrary itemsets in terms of their relative supports and document overlap . The result is that more frequent itemsets asymptotically form clusters at the expense of less frequent itemsets that overlap them . If there is no overlapping itemset with more support , then a given itemset will form a cluster for a sufficiently large value of the nonlinearity parameter p . For overlapping itemsets with equal support , the itemset members not in common asymptotically form clusters , and each of the members in common are asymptotically in one of those clusters , though there is no guarantee for exactly which of them .
This theoretical guarantee provides no upper bound on the necessary degree of nonlinearity of p to ensure itemset clustering for a given data set . But empirically , we have found that the transformation p

3 . Hierarchical Clusters with Higher Order Co Citations in
Clustering plays a central role information retrieval . In classical work , clustering based on cocitation similarity is known to correspond well to individual fields of knowledge [ 7 ] . For information retrieval , results from simple keyword queries can be clustered into more refined topics . Co citation based clustering provides a narrowing of search results , by allowing the user to focus on documents in pertinent clusters only . This helps alleviate the potentially tedious task of manually reviewing large lists of search results . Also , co citation analysis can broaden search results by providing alternative documents linked by co citation .
Three important heuristics for clustering are singlelinkage , average linkage , and complete linkage . These heuristics are agglomerative , at each step merging clusters that have the closest distance between them . Arguments have been given for all three heuristics in terms of desirable clustering characteristics .
For our experiments with real world document collections , clusters resulting from the 3 criteria are generally significantly different . This suggests that the documents are not inherently distributed as wellseparated clusters . In particular , we have seen ample real world examples of single linkage “ chaining . ” This is in direct contrast to the classical notion that typical document collections have well defined clusters , so that single linkage is adequate [ 7 ] . However , at least one author has suggested that single linkage clustering may be inadequate for citation analysis [ 8 ] . is a
The dendrogram tree visualization of a hierarchical clustering . Leaves of the dendrogram tree are individual documents , at the lowest level of the hierarchy . Non leaf nodes represent the merging of two or more clusters , at increasing levels of the hierarchy . A node is drawn as a horizontal line that spans over its children , with the line drawn at the vertical position corresponding to the merge threshold distance .
We now demonstrate our approach to itemset based clustering , in which we compare frequent itemsets to graph theoretic clustering . The demonstration employs data extracted from a literature citation database , the Institute for Scientific Information ’s Science Citation Index ( SCI ) . We do the itemset/clustering comparison by a novel augmentation of the dendrogram with members of frequent itemsets , which allows an easy visual assessment of our proposed itemset matching metric . For the example , we do an SCI query with keyword “ wavelet* ” for the year 1999 . The first 100 documents returned by the query cite 1755 documents . We filter these cited documents by citation count , retaining only those cited three or more times , resulting in a set of 34 highly cited documents .
We then compute complete linkage , average linkage , and single linkage clusters for the set of 34 highly cited documents . Here we first apply the standard pairwise method of computing co citation based distances . The resulting augmented dendrogram is shown in Figure 1 . The dendrogram is augmented by the addition of graphical symbols for members of frequent 4 itemsets , added at the corresponding tree leaves .
In this example , the most frequently occurring 4itemset is {2 , 17 , 19 , 20} . For complete linkage , documents 17 , 19 , and 20 of this itemset are a possible cluster . These documents apply wavelets to problems in the field of chemistry , and are well separated from the rest of the collection , both thematically and in terms of co citations . But including document 2 ( a foundational wavelet paper by wavelet pioneer Mallat ) in this cluster would require the inclusion of documents 12 , 15 , and 25 , which are not in the itemset . These three additional documents are another foundational wavelet paper by Mallat , and two foundational papers by fellow pioneer Daubechies .
For single linkage , there is even less cluster/itemset consistency . The itemset {2 , 17 , 19 , 20} is possible within a cluster only by including 8 other documents . We interpret this as being largely caused by single linkage chaining . In general , the application of clustering to mere pairwise co citation similarities is insufficient larger cardinality appear as clusters , even with completelinkage . for ensuring itemsets of that
As a comparison with standard pairwise distances , Figure 2 shows complete linkage clusters computed with our hybrid pairwise/higher order distances . It considers three separate cases , each case being taken over multiple values of itemset cardinality c . The three cases are 3,2=c . Here the itemset supports ] ]4 ( ) ( )I ( ) z I I with distances computed via ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) , and ( 4 ) . are nonlinearly transformed by

. However , the case the two cases 3,2=c has inconsistency for the most frequent itemset . It is apparent that the lowest order ( pairwise ) supports are the source of the disagreement . Lower order supports are generally larger than higher order supports , and thus tend to dominate the summation in ( 1 ) .

Figure 1 . For standard co citation document distances , there is considerable inconsistency between clusters and frequent itemsets .
We suggest that clustering dendrograms such as Figure 2 can provide greatly enhanced understanding of document sets resulting from information retrieval keyword searches . Augmentation with symbols for frequent itemset members allows direct identification of these important itemset . The visualized clusters and itemsets are computed from distances based on citation ( link ) text based analysis . As retrieval output , the user would be presented with a modified form of the dendrogram shown here , which has been rotated clockwise by 90(cid:176 ) and augmented with text corresponding to each document . thus complementing information ,
The augmented dendrogram we propose can help guide the navigation of retrieval results . For example , small representative samples can be examined from a number of separate clusters , allowing the user to more quickly identify documents of potential interest . Once a promising cluster is identified , the user can then focus solely on documents within it .
4 . Experimental Results
This paper proposes new methods of visualizing hypertext document clusters for information retrieval . The methodology employs a new class of inter document distances that is a hybrid between standard pairwise and higher order distances . These higher order distances are analogous to itemset supports in association mining . to
In real world hypertext . this section , we apply our proposed hybrid document distances In particular , we apply them to data sets from the Institute for Scientific Information ’s Science Citation Index ( SCI ) . Science citations are a classical form of hypertext , and are of significant general interest . The assumption that links imply some form of content influence also holds reasonably well for citations . This is in contrast to Web hypertext , in which links could be for more general purposes , such as navigation .
The SCI data sets we employ are described in Table 1 . For each data set , the table gives the SCI query keyword and publication year(s ) , the number of citing documents resulting from the query , and the number of documents they cite after filtering by citation count . For the data sets 1 , 5 , and 9 , results are included for both co citations and bibliographic coupling , yielding data sets 2 , 6 , and 10 ( respectively ) , for a total of 10 SCI data sets .
Our empirical tests apply a metric that compares clustering to frequent itemsets , determining whether given itemsets form clusters comprised only of the itemset members . In other words , we determine the minimal cardinality cluster that contains all the members of a given itemset , and compare that cluster cardinality to the itemset cardinality . This is then averaged over a number of itemsets , to yield an overall itemset matching metric for a clustering . More formally , let be a partition } of items consistent with the hierarchical clustering merge tree . Furthermore , let be a set of , 2 I , there is some itemsets . Then for each itemset p

For the 20 combinations of 10 data sets and 2 itemset cardinalities , we find that itemset support nonlinearities with p=4 are usually sufficient ( 15 of 20 ) for a good match to frequent itemsets . Otherwise nonlinearities with p=6 in ( 5 ) are sufficient , in all but one of the 20 combinations . Here we consider a clustering metric value greater than about 0.7 to be a good match . This corresponds to a frequent itemset comprising on average about 70 % of a cluster that contains all its members .

» ( cid:229 ) » ( cid:229 ) · · results show that excluding itemset supports below minsup generally has little effect on clustering results , particular for smaller values of minsup . However , there is some degradation in metric values for higher levels of minsup . Here “ degradation ” means that metric values are smaller when some itemset supports are excluded , corresponding to a poorer clustering match to frequent itemsets .
We offer the following interpretation for the minsupdependent degradation in clustering metric . Members of frequent itemsets are typically frequently cited documents overall . Such frequently cited documents are likely to appear in many itemsets , even less frequent itemsets . Thus there are likely to be many itemsets below minsup that contain these frequently cited documents . Excluding itemsets below minsup then removes the supports that these itemsets contribute to the summations in computing hybrid distances .
5 . Summary and Conclusions
We have proposed a new methodology for visualizing association mining results . A central component in the methodology is a new class of inter item distances computed directly from itemset supports . While the distances are computed from supports of itemsets of arbitrary cardinality , they still retain a simple pairwise structure . These hybrid pairwise/higher cardinality distances thus allow the direct application of standard visualization tools such as clustering dendrograms . However , less complex user interaction compared to that of working directly with all are frequent computationally for computing frequent itemsets . We provided a theoretical guarantee the new hybrid distances , consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets is attainable independent of the clustering criterion .
The hybrid distances fast algorithms require much feasible via that under they itemsets . for dendrogram
We proposed the application of the hierarchical clustering association mining visualization , which enables quick comprehension of complex distance relationships among items . We also introduced new augmentations of the dendrogram to support the visual mining process by adding itemdescriptive text , and graphical symbols for members of frequent itemsets .
We tested the effects of our new hybrid distances on hierarchical clustering dendrograms , for large numbers of test cases with data extracted from the Science Citation Index . In particular , we compared dendrograms between a variety of hybrid distance formulas and standard pairwise distances , in terms of a metric that measures consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets . For the majority of the test cases , metric values were higher for our hybrid distances , indicating better consistency between clusters and frequent itemsets . We also conducted experiments showing that excluding itemset supports below some minimum value has relatively little effect on itemset/cluster consistency , so that it is reasonable to apply fast algorithms for computing the frequent itemsets needed for the hybrid distances . in Proceedings of
This is the first known application of clustering for the visualizing association mining results . The pairwise structure of the new hybrid inter item distances allows the visualization of frequent itemsets of arbitrary cardinalities . The nonlinear transformation of itemset supports helps ensure consistency between clusters and important frequent itemsets , making frequent itemsets less likely to be obscured during visualization . As a more basic contribution , this work represents a first step towards the unification of association mining and clustering visualization .
