ABSTRACT Collaborative tagging services ( folksonomies ) have been among the stars of the Web 2.0 era . They allow their users to label diverse resources with freely chosen keywords ( tags ) . Our studies of two real world folksonomies unveil that individual users develop highly personalized vocabularies of tags . While these meet individual needs and preferences , the considerable differences between personal tag vocabularies ( personomies ) impede services such as social search or customized tag recommendation . In this paper , we introduce a novel user centric tag model that allows us to derive mappings between personal tag vocabularies and the corresponding folksonomies . Using these mappings , we can infer the meaning of user assigned tags and can predict choices of tags a user may want to assign to new items . Furthermore , our translational approach helps in reducing common problems related to tag ambiguity , synonymous tags , or multilingualism . We evaluate the applicability of our method in tag recommendation and tag based social search . Extensive experiments show that our translational model improves the prediction accuracy in both scenarios .

INTRODUCTION
On line services , such as Delicious1 , Flickr2 , or LibraryThing3 , have evolved into important and popular content collection , management , and sharing tools . They allow their users to label content by assigning freely chosen keywords ( tags ) . In such open environments , tagging has proven a powerful alternative to existing top down categorization techniques , such as taxonomies or predefined dictionaries , that lack flexibility and are generally expensive in their creation and maintenance . In contrast , tagging allows users to choose the labels that match their real needs , tastes , or language , which reduces the required cognitive efforts . Community services that center around the tagging of resources are called folksonomies [ 27 ] . These communities have become a valuable source of information , since they bundle the interests , preferences , or contributions of thousand or millions of users .
Folksonomies come in two forms , depending on the underlying tagging rights [ 26 ] . Narrow folksonomies restrict the bookmarking and thus tagging of resources to only a limited number of users . A common example of this type of folksonomy is Flickr , where photos are labeled by their owner . In this paper , we will instead focus on broad folksonomies , such as Delicious or Bibsonomy4 , where items can be bookmarked and tagged by the entire community , such that the tagging activity of one user can be related to the activity of other users . The difference in tagging rights is also expected to have a severe impact on the observed motivations behind tagging . Whereas users of narrow folksonomies may try to promote their content by assigning common tags , ie tags other users will most likely search for , this motivation is less present in broad folksonomies , where users tag other users’ content . As a result , users of broad folksonomies have a limited interest in the social aspects of tagging , but will assign tags for personal content retrieval . In consequence , we observe these users developing their own tag vocabularies , more commonly known as personomies [ 11 ] , which may differ drastically from those of other users .

1http://delicious.com 2http://wwwflickrcom 3http://wwwlibrarythingorg 4http://wwwbibsonomyorg is not as free as it seems . Instead , there exists an underlying interest in a stable and proven set of category tags for more efficient content retrieval at a later stage . Accordingly , we observe that individual tagging habits remain relatively stable if long term effects , ie changing user interests , can be ignored . Apparently , this trend is further strengthened by the tag recommendation functionalities that all popular tagging sites have introduced to their services . However , an individual user ’s interest in a converging set of category tags is not a social phenomenon . Instead , we observe that even if two users bookmark conceptually similar content , the tags they prefer for categorizing this content are likely to differ . It simply appears to be a matter of personal taste which category tags a user chooses among existing synonymous forms , singular or plural forms , abbreviations , etc . Also , we find that individual tag vocabularies often reflect the multilingualism of users or their different levels of expertise .
From an information retrieval perspective , the fact that tags are highly personalized may be ignored on a macroscopic scale , where cumulative effects dominate over local heterogeneities . In fact , our studies reveal that resources in broad folksonomies develop a characteristic and stable tag spectrum independent of user level differences . Consequently , tags have been successfully used to calculate the similarity between items [ 14 , 16 , 21 ] as well as for item clustering and concept extraction [ 2 , 8 , 14 ] . However , effects due to customized tag assignments ( TAS ) cannot be neglected for applications and scenarios such as personalized tag based search , tag recommendation , or user interest discovery , which focus on the needs of individual users . 1.1 Our contribution
We study the user level tagging behavior in two representative broad folksonomies and provide evidence that users follow different tagging strategies . We present a novel , usercentric tag model ( UCTM ) that overcomes the problems this diversity induces in many potential application areas , including tag recommendation , user interest discovery , and tag based search . Our model infers the semantics of tags based on who applied them and by looking at the items they have been assigned to . By studying these contexts and their co occurrence with the tags chosen by other users , we then derive translational mappings between individual personomy tags and the corresponding folksonomy . These mappings help us to overcome common problems related to tag ambiguity , synonymous tags , and biases towards singular or plural forms . The translation of personomy tags even allows us to account for multilingual communities . Furthermore , by translating user tags to the language of the community , we can deduce the meaning of a tag based on who assigned it and design more robust user models that overcome inter user discrepancies in tagging . On the other hand , translating from the folksonomy language to a user ’s individual language enables us to predict the concepts ( tags ) that a user will associate with an item based on the associations of other users . We evaluate the applicability of our translational approach in two user centric scenarios , that we describe in the next section . 1.2 Application Scenarios
Tag recommendation .
Tag recommenders support a user during the posting pro cess by suggesting potentially relevant tags . In addition to their positive effect on usability , they are effective tools to limit global and local tag divergence by lowering the ratio of misspellings and increasing the likelihood of tag reassignments . We consider the scenario of graph based tag recommendation , where no additional information about the underlying items , tags , or users is given . Our approach allows us to translate community tags previously assigned to a resource into a user ’s own tagging language , producing more accurate predictions . Tag recommendation is probably the best researched recommendation scenario in the context of folksonomies , see eg [ 7 , 10 , 12 , 22 , 24 , 25 ] . This scenario therefore allows us the evaluation our approach with respect to previously presented methods .
Social search .
Folksonomies have become important sources for content search , since they aggregate the interests of thousands or millions of users and index content by tags . Our second application scenario considers a user who searches for interesting items related to a tag from her personomy . In this use case , we assume that the user wants to find relevant content related to topics she has been interested in before . Our goal is to simplify this task . Instead of having to guess how other users labeled relevant content , our solution allows the user to rely solely on her own tag vocabulary for search . The challenges in this scenario are not only the personalized retrieval of interesting items , but also the identification of the individual search intention behind a given tag . We will show that this intention can be inferred by our translation approach , yielding more useful search results . Although we limit our discussion here to a search scenario , we believe that our findings also apply to related tasks such as the topic aware recommendation of items or the topic aware detection and indication of trends .
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows . We begin with a discussion of related work and provide a description of the folksonomy datasets we use for our studies and evaluations . We then analyze these datasets in order to verify the assumptions that motivate our approach . This is followed by the description of our translational model and its evaluation in the application scenarios described above .
2 . RELATED WORK
Recent years have seen an increasing number of publications on different aspects of folksonomies . Among the first publications are [ 6 ] , [ 17 ] , and [ 18 ] that provide an initial overview on the structure and dynamics of collaborative tagging systems and start modeling folksonomies as tripartite hypergraphs [ 18 ] .
2.1 Tag models
The authors of [ 6 ] investigate the user intentions behind tagging . Of the tags they analyzed a vast majority referred to the topic , type , or owner of the underlying content . These results have been confirmed and extended to various types of folksonomies by Bischoff et al . [ 3 ] . Both studies , [ 6 ] and [ 3 ] , do not investigate the differences in user level tagging strategies . The authors of [ 19 ] propose an approach to tag translation for cross language retrieval . Tags are considered valid translations if they expose similar global tag co occurrence patterns . The contextualization of tags for improved tag disambiguation was proposed by Yeung et al . [ 2 ] . The authors present a co occurrence measure that considers two resources as similar if a user has labeled them with the same tag . They report that this user centric measure is better adapted for tag disambiguation than other co occurrence measures . Further research on various tag cooccurrence distributions is presented in [ 5 , 16 , 20 ] . Li et al . [ 14 ] note that users of the Delicious bookmarking service use personalized vocabularies for the same URLs . They further argue that these differences can be neglected when looking only at URL tags due to cumulative effects . Both observations inspire our translation approach , which uses the tag cooccurrences between personomies and the folksonomy within the tagged resources in order to create mappings . However , we believe that the user level differences in tagging can only be neglected in non user centric scenarios .
2.2 Tag recommendation
One of the first works on graph based tag recommendation in folksonomies is [ 12 ] . The authors compare the performance of co occurrence based tag recommenders and more advanced methods like the FolkRank algorithm [ 11 ] . They report only minor improvements of the FolkRank method over the co occurrence approaches . Instead of reducing the folksonomy hypergraph to bipartite co occurrence graphs , Symeonidis et al . [ 25 ] propose to decompose the full folksonomy tensor and estimate missing values using Higher Order SVD ( HOSVD ) . The authors claim reasonably good results on the task of tag recommendation . Rendle et al . [ 22 ] report an even better performance when using ranking oriented tensor factorization methods . Most similar to our work is an approach by Lipczak [ 15 ] . The proposed tag recommender weights the tags of each user ’s personomy with respect to community tags using a lexicon based approach , but no further details about the mappings are provided . Other , less related work on tag recommendation is [ 7 , 10 , 24 ] .
2.3 Social search
Because of the user driven aggregation and labeling of content , folksonomies are valuable sources for content retrieval . Heymann et al . [ 9 ] investigate the potential of social bookmarking services , such as Delicious , for enhanced web search . They show that there exists a reasonably high overlap between search query terms and tags found in Delicious . Similar studies are presented by Krause et al . [ 13 ] . Zanardi et al . [ 32 ] approach the problem of content recommendation in folksonomies by a collaborative filtering approach where the similarity between users is determined by tag overlap . Furthermore , the authors expand tag queries by including closely related tags . Wu et al . [ 30 ] develop a probabilistic latent topic model for folksonomies . Their model returns items that fall into the same latent topic(s ) as the user query . Similar to this approach , Wetzker at al . [ 28 ] propose a hybrid item recommender that merges collaborative filtering and tag based models into a unified representation . Their results show an improved performance of standard collaborative filtering techniques when adding tags . Another hybrid approach to item recommendation is presented by Xu et al . [ 31 ] , who design a personalized search framework that ranks documents by their similarity to a user and the input query in the tag space . Finally , the universality of the FolkRank algorithm also allows its deployment in a social search scenario , as demonstrated by Hotho et al . [ 11 ] . None of these existing works consider the meaning of a tag to be user specific . Instead , it is generally assumed that the meaning of a tag is intrinsic .
3 . DATASETS
We conduct our analysis and evaluate our model based on large snapshots of two popular social bookmarking services .
Delicious is probably the best researched folksonomy to date . Its users can centrally save and organize their bookmark collections on the Web . Our Delicious dataset is a subset of the one presented in [ 29 ] , which is publicly available upon request . To avoid spam related artifacts , we remove users with a very high concentration of URLs that point to the same domain(s ) . This filters highly influential spammers who intend to promote only a limited number of domains by posting many URLs . Of the spam filtered corpus , we only keep the bookmarks recorded in the first 16 months from September 2003 until December 2004 .
Bibsonomy is another highly researched folksonomy where users collect and annotate URLs as well as publications . We use the Bibsonomy snapshot that was made available during the 2009 ECML PKDD tag recommendation challenge . We simplify the scenario by fusing URLs and publications into a single item set , as previously done by other authors [ 11 , 12 , 22 , 25 ] . The dataset does not require any spam filtering , since spam was manually removed by the Bibsonomy team .
From both datasets we only consider the actual network between users , items , and tags and ignore all additional data , such as content descriptions or bibliographic information in the case of publications . Our user level analysis of tagging is based on the full folksonomy graphs . For the tag recommendation and the search scenario we instead follow common practice and perform our evaluations on p core versions of the original graphs , with p set to 5 . The p core of a folksonomy graph is its largest subgraph where all users , items , and tags appear in at least p bookmarks of the subgraph [ 12 ] . The resulting global dataset statistics are shown in Table 1 .

4 . THE NEED FOR TAG TRANSLATION
Our translational approach is motivated by several assumptions . We examine the validity of these assumptions by analyzing the available data .
A1 : People tag for personal later retrieval .
The intention to save content for possible later use is a general characteristic of folksonomies [ 27 ] . To reach an optimal retrieval efficiency , folksonomy members will tend to avoid the usage of synonymous tags . Furthermore , one might expect that folksonomy users are less interested in the social effects of their tagging behavior , resulting in individual tagging strategies . To exemplify this behavior , Figure

Figure 1 : ( a ) Intra personomy distribution of synonymous tags in Delicious . The x axis measures the ratio at which a user chooses the right tag from both choices . The histograms emphasize that users avoid mixing equivalent tags , since this would complicate later resource retrieval . ( b ) Cosine similarities between the tags that two randomly selected users assigned to the same resources . Only user pairs that shared at least 5 items have been included in the evaluation . The plot shows that the tags which two users apply to the same items do not have to overlap . Hence , users who obviously share the same interests by bookmarking the same content do not have to appear to be similar in the tag space . ( c ) Probability that a new tag exists in a user ’s personomy or in the item vocabulary as a function of the number of previous tag assignments ( TAS ) by each user and to each resource ( Delicious ) . The tag coverage constantly increases with growing vocabularies , indicating converging tag distributions .
1(a ) investigates to what degree Delicious users mix synonymous tags , such as “ webdev ” versus “ webdevelopment ” . The x axis shows the ratio at which a user selects one of the two synonyms . The figure illustrates that users tend to avoid using both tags in parallel , but rather stick to their initially chosen alternative . Similar observations can be made for Bibsonomy . Table 2 lists the tags which two Bibsonomy users assigned to the same resources as well as the Top 5 community tags . Both users have developed standardized sets of category tags , avoiding the mixture of equivalent tags , such as “ collaborative ” versus “ collaboration ” or “ folksonomy ” versus “ folksonomies ” . These categories do not necessarily have to overlap with the community opinion , but may satisfy more personal classification needs , as demonstrated by User237 .
Further support for our assumption comes from the observation that 15 percent of all Delicious users in our dataset group tags to so called tag bundles . This feature of Delicious lets users define categories and list the personomy tags that should fall into each category , providing users with an additional top down classification technique . Moreover , since tag bundles behave like meta tags they can help find previously bookmarked items by category . The rather frequent use of this technique further highlights the retrieval motivation behind tagging .
A2 : People tag differently .
Table 2 also highlights inter user differences in tagging strategies . While User107 has a tendency towards commonly assigned tags , we find the second user ( User237 ) to have developed a personalized set of labels including tags , such as “ diplomathesis ” or “ closelyrelated ” , that rather describe the user ’s relation to the respective content than the content itself . Figure 1(b ) further emphasizes the usercentric nature of tagging by looking at the cosine similarity between the tags two randomly selected users assigned to the same resources . The evaluation only includes pairs of users who share at least five items . Independent of the dataset , about 20 to 30 percent of all pairs of users labeled the same resources in such a different manner that there exists nearly no overlap between the assigned tags . The divergence of categorization strategies likely even exceeds the one shown in Figure 1(b ) , because , as we will discuss in the following , many overlapping tags describe a specific item and are not part of any categorization scheme . Therefore , even in cases where two users obviously share common interests by bookmarking the same content , they do not necessarily appear similar in the tag space . Deriving user similarities by simple personomy comparison , cf . eg [ 23 , 32 ] , will hence lead to suboptimal results . We therefore propose first to translate the personomies of users into a unified global representation before taking further steps .
A3 : People share a common understanding about content .
A prerequisite of our model is the relative stability of tag distributions from an item perspective . Figures 2(a) (c ) look at how the tag distributions of three exemplary URLs develop over time . All plots show a convergence after only a few bookmarking events . The collaborative labeling of content thus leads to the emergence of a characteristic and stable tag spectrum despite of user level discrepancies . This spectrum is dominated by a minority of very frequent tags , with the most popular tag being assigned in more than 25 percent of all cases independent of the URL . These dominant tags are not item specific , describing the name of the URL or service , but rather describe the primal concern of the resource , such as “ news ” ( a ) , “ reference ” ( b ) , or “ css ” ( c ) . On the other hand , looking at the node degrees unveils a majority of tags that appear only once . This inequality between dominant and infrequent tags seems even more pronounced than in power law distributions , that have been comprehensively reported for various network types including folksonomies [ 11 , 14 , 20 ] . We attribute this bias to the

Figure 2 : Tag distribution over time for three Delicious URLs and users . Each line corresponds to the frequency of one tag wrt the overall number of tag assignments ( TAS ) . The small plots show the corresponding node degree distributions ( log log scale ) . Resources develop a characteristic and stable tag spectrum strongly dominated by very few tags . User vocabularies , on the other hand , react more dynamically to shifting user ’s interests or tagging behavior . The node degree distributions of personomies exhibit power law characteristics , whereas the contrast between very frequent and very rare item tags even exceeds an expected power law divergence . fact that though users agree on some characteristic resource labels – an agreement likely to be supported by existing tag recommenders – they additionally tend to assign their own sets of category tags . The diversity of these tags results in the observed long tail distributions of the node degrees .
An exploration of the 500 most popular URLs in our Delicious corpus unveils stable tag distributions for all items , and we believe that this stability is a natural consequence of collaborative tagging . These scale free spectra allow us to infer a folksonomy opinion about resources , even if these have been bookmarked by only a subset of users . This justifies our idea of translating to the community vocabulary , although we only deal with incomplete data . The stability of the community opinion is also important from a practical perspective , since we do not need to retrain our translational mappings whenever resources receive additional bookmarks .
A4 : Personomies are stable in the short term .
Our translation approach tacitly assumes that the user models , which have been trained on past data , are valid for the prediction of future user behavior . This makes it essential to look at how fast user interests and tagging strategies , that both manifest within personomies , actually change . Juxtaposing the personomies of Delicious users , we encounter more diversity then we did for item vocabularies . However , the majority of personomies develops similar to the examples that are displayed in the second row of Figure 2 . Not unexpectedly , we observe that personomies are much less static than resource labels and reflect interest shifts or changing labeling strategies . User tag models , even though representative in the short term , will therefore require constant updates . Furthermore , comparing the tag distributions of URLs and users unveils that personomies tend to be less dominated by very frequent tags than are resources . Instead , the distributions of node degrees often look more similar to power law distributions which corresponds to linear relations on a log log scale . The deviating distribution patterns between personomy and item tags render it less efficient to directly compute user item similarities , eg by calculating the overlap between personomies and item vocalbularies [ 23 ] . Our approach overcomes these problems by mapping user tags to item derived vocabularies before calculating similarities .
Another way to investigate the stability of personomies is to look at the number of newly assigned tags that did not occur in the vocabulary before . Figure 1(c ) illustrates that the percentage of new tags covered by a user ’s personomy constantly increases as the personomy grows . The first 10 tags a user assigns reoccur in more than 50 percent of the following labels which is a further indicator of the stability of user interests in the short term . The results of Figure 1(c ) are also significant for the tag recommendation scenario , since they represent the maximum recall rates purely item or user vocabulary based recommenders can achieve given the tag assignments in the training data .
The assumptions explained in this section form the basic building blocks of our translation approach which we describe in the following section .
5 . TRANSLATING PERSONOMIES 5.1 Notation
Figure 3 : A folksonomy as a tensor and corresponding matrices after aggregating over one mode . graphic letters for tensors ( Y ) , bold capital letters for matrices ( A ) , and bold lower case letters for vectors ( u ) . Sets and set elements are represented by non bold letters , eg I and i . Capital letter subscripts of tensors and matrices denote the sets corresponding to each mode , such that the matrix AIT represents a |I| by |T | matrix with rows and columns build from the sets I and T respectively . Lower case letter subscripts represent the reduction to only one entry of the corresponding set , eg Ait is the entry of AIT that resides in row i and column t . Analogously , we will use subscripts for sets to indicate the members of the original set that fall into the context represented by the subscript , eg Iu represents all items a user u has bookmarked . 5.2 Formalization
A folksonomy can be represented by a tuple F := ( I , T , U , Y ) , where I , T , U are finite sets of items , tags , and users , and Y ⊆ I × T × U is a ternary relation , whose elements are called tag assignments [ 11 ] . Bookmarks can then be formalized as the sets of tag assignments that share the same user item entities B = {(i , u)|∃t : ( i , t , u ) ∈ Y } . The tag vocabulary of a user , her personomy , is given as Tu = {t|∃i : ( i , t , u ) ∈ Y } , the tag vocabulary of an item as Ti = {t|∃u : ( i , t , u ) ∈ Y } , and the tags of a bookmark as Tiu = {t|(i , t , u ) ∈ Y } .
A natural way to represent the ternary relations Y that build a folksonomy are tensors as shown in Figure 3 . We can construct the folksonomy tensor Y IT U ∈ R|I|×|T |×|U | that represents Y as
Y itu =fl 1 , if ( i , t , u ) ∈ Y
0 , otherwise .
Modeling folksonomies as tensors allows us to apply tensor calculus to derive substructures of Y . For example , the cooccurrence matrix AIT of items and tags , which we will later require for our translation model , can be calculated by aggregating the tags assigned to each item over all users . This is equivalent to
Following common notation conventions we use bold calli
AIT = Y IT U ×U u1 ,
( 1 ) where ×X is the vector product with a tensor in the mode represented by X , and u1 is a vector of size |U | of all ones . Each entry Ait of the matrix AIT hence denotes the number of users that have labeled i with t . It is likewise possible to aggregate along other modes as shown in Figure 3 . Using the vector product , we can also derive the tags a user assigned to an item as t(i , u ) = Y IT U ×I i ×U u ,
( 2 ) where i and u are vectors of all zeros except for the indices that correspond to the user item pair and which are set to 1 . Notation wise , this is equivalent to writing Y iT u . 5.3 Calculating the translation tensor
We assume that each user has a distinctive vocabulary of tags that can be translated to the folksonomy vocabulary by looking at tag co occurrences within the shared item space . Employing tensor calculus , we can construct the tensor T T ˜T U that contains these ( item normalized ) tag co occurrence counts for each user as
T T ˜T U = Y IT U ×I A′
T I ,
( 3 ) where the T and ˜T modes of the translation tensor represent the folksonomy and personomy tag dimensions , A′ T I is the transposed and item normalized stochastic version of the global item tag co occurrence matrix from Equation 1 , and ×X denotes the matrix product with a tensor in the mode corresponding to the set X . The value of each element in T T ˜T U is thus equal to
T t˜tu =Xi∈I
Y i˜tuA′ ti .

Since Y i˜tu will be 1 if ( i , ˜t , u ) ∈ Y and 0 otherwise , this can also be written as
T t˜tu = Xi∈Iu˜t
A′ ti .
( 5 )
Each tag ˜t from the personomy of a user u is thus represented by a tag vector T T ˜tu that aggregates the tag distributions of all items that user u has labeled with ˜t . One important aspect of our model is that it considers the user as a part of the folksonomy she is mapped to . This allows us to derive primitive mappings even in cases where a user does not share any items with other users or where the shared items are sparsely tagged .
Based on T T ˜T U , tags from a user ’s personomy represented by ˜t can now be translated to the folksonomy vocabulary by simple vector multiplication : hand , will help us to infer the meaning of a query tag in the search scenario .
6 . SCENARIO 1 : TAG RECOMMENDA
TION
Tag recommendation within a folksonomy is the task of predicting Y iT u for a previously unseen bookmark , ie ( i , u ) /∈ B . 6.1 The tag recommender
We approach the problem of tag recommendation by translating the tag spectrum of the item i to the person omy of user u . The weights bt(i , u ) for each personomy tag are calculated using Equation 7 as
˜t(i , u ) =
T T ˜T u ×T A′ |T T ˜T u ×T A′ iT iT |
,
( 8 ) iT = A′ where A′ IT ×I i denotes the item ’s community tag distribution . Based on ˜t(i , u ) we can now predict the personomy tags a user will assign to a new item . However , ˜t(i , u ) only contains weights for tags within the user ’s personomy , whereas all tags the user did not assign yet will have zero weights . Recommending tags solely based on ˜t(i , u ) would thus disregard the previously noted fact that many tags are item specific ( see also Figure 1(c) ) . We therefore extend our model to include item tags to bt(i , u ) = αet(i , u ) + ( 1 − α ) t(i ) , with t(i ) = A′ iT . Tags are thus recommended from a mixture of personomy and item tags , where the parameter 0 ≤ α ≤ 1 controls the mixture ratio . For each user item combination , we then recommend the N tags with the
( 9 ) highest value inbt(i , u ) .
6.2 Experiments
We run our evaluations on p core versions of the original Delicious and Bibsonomy datasets with p set to 5 . From both datasets we randomly select 10 percent of all bookmarks for testing and keep the rest for training . For each test bookmark , we then predict a ranked list of tags based onbt(i , u ) and calculate the achieved P recision , Recall and the corresponding F1 measures at different ranks N . We report results averaged over all bookmarks and 10 test runs . The best value of the α parameter is determined using a brute force approach . We choose the α value that performs best in terms of maximal reached F1 measure . 621 Other recommenders t(˜t , u ) =
T T ˜T u × ˜T |T T ˜T u × ˜T
˜t ˜t|
,
( 6 )
We compare the results achieved by our user centric tag model ( UCTM ) approach to a variety of baseline recommenders . where |.| represents the sum of all vector elements . Each value of t(˜t , u ) gives us a weight for the user meaning t when saying ˜t . Analogously , we can translate from the global tag language to a user ’s personomy :
˜t(t , u ) =
T T ˜T u ×T t |T T ˜T u ×T t|
.

We will later use the mapping from Equation 7 to identify the most likely user tags for an item given the tags previously assigned by the community . The translation of user tags to the global tag vocabulary from Equation 6 , on the other

Adapted PageRank Hotho et al .
[ 11 ] propose an extension of the well known PageRank algorithm [ 4 ] to folksonomies . Instead of the Web graph , they merge all node sets to a set V = I ∪ T ∪ U . They then construct a |V | × |V | weighted adjacency matrix A , where each entry corresponds to the number of times two nodes co occur in Y . The weight update process is defined as w ← dAw+(1−d)p , where p is a preference vector , and d regulates the impact of the preference vector . As proposed by [ 12 ] , we set entries of p to 1 except for the entries that correspond to the input item and user and that are set to |I| and |U | respectively . d is set to 07 We stop the weight diffusion process after 10 steps .
FolkRank The fact that edges within folksonomies are undirected results in a suboptimal accuracy of the Adapted PageRank algorithm [ 11 , 12 ] . As a consequence , Hotho et al . [ 11 ] propose a differential approach w = w1 −w0 , where w0 is the global weighting obtained from the Adapted PageRank algorithm when p = 1 , and w1 is the result vector with preference , as described above . This differential approach is known as the FolkRank algorithm . for of value optimal the parameter β
The the M ostP opularI,U model is again determined by a brute force approach . For all recommenders we always suggest the N tags with the highest weight . 6.3 Results
Figure 4 presents the P recision and Recall values of all recommenders when suggesting up to 10 tags . Independent of the dataset , we observe very similar results , with our user centric tag model ( U CT M ) performing best . The importance of tag translation is highlighted when comparing the results of the M ostP opularU with the U CT Mα=1 recommender . Both models only return the tags a user has already used before . However , selecting tags based on the ( translated ) community opinion about an item is much more accurate , since it respects the item ’s nature . The comparably good result of the M ostP opularI recommender is most likely a consequence of the previously discussed very high density of item tags , which simplifies the prediction of popular tags . However , combining item and ( translated ) user tags still yields large performance gains , and a M ostP opularI,U recommender with β set to 0.5 produces reasonable good results on both datasets , outperforming even more advanced approaches such as the F olkRank method .
The best recommendations on both datasets are given by a U CT M recommender with a mixture ratio of α = 06 This recommender reaches a maximal F1 measure of 0.514 on Bibsonomy and 0.533 on Delicious , performing significantly better than the M ostP opularI,U ( 0478/0448 ) and the FolkRank ( 0430/0413 ) methods . The performance gain of our approach on the Delicious dataset is probably a consequence of larger personomy sizes that result in more robust translational models . The very good performance of our U CT M approach underlines the potential of tag translation for the task of tag recommendation . This potential is even higher if we consider that our method of fusing translated user and item tag models in Equation 9 is rather basic and still leaves much space for improvements .
7 . SCENARIO 2 : SOCIAL SEARCH
In the social search scenario we consider a user who wants to find content related to one of the tags from her personomy . Search scenarios will generally require that the user guesses the tags other users might have assigned to relevant content . Instead , we enable the user to search based on her individual vocabulary and translate the user query to the global vocabulary . The proposed social search service thus supports users in discovering new content with respect to the topics they have previously shown interest in . For instance , User237 from Table 2 may search for publications using the tag “ diplomathesis ” and expecting results similar to the documents he previously labeled with this tag . This allows her to discover content related to her own work of which she was previously unaware of . The challenge in this scenario is to identify the search intention that a user asso

We divide the search process into two steps : The translation of the query tag to the global vocabulary and the actual item retrieval . Translating a single user tag ˜t only requires to look at it ’s previous co occurrence with other tags represented by the vector T T ˜tu within the translation tensor T T ˜T U . In the second step , we then identify the items which generally fall together with these community tags calculat ing the weight vectorbi(˜t , u ) as bi(˜t , u ) =
T T ˜tu ×T A∗ |T T ˜tu ×T A∗
IT IT |
,
( 10 ) where A∗ IT is the tag normalized stochastic version of the matrix AIT . In this work , we only consider single tag search queries . However , our model can be easily extended to ˜t , where multi tag queries by replacing T T ˜tu with T T ˜T u× ˜T ˜t is the tag vector corresponding to the query . We set all values ofbi(˜t , u ) to 0 where ( i , u ) ∈ B , since items are book marked only once per user . 7.2 Experiments
We apply the same test setup as in the tag recommendation scenario . For each bookmark of the test set we now randomly select a tag to simulate a query and try to predict the item the user had labeled with this tag . To avoid item specific tags with little expressiveness for user interests , we require that each query tag was applied at least 5 times by the user in the training data . For each user tag combination we then recommend the N items with highest weight inbi(˜t , u ) . As for the tag recommendation scenario , we test our approach against a variety of other methods , including the previously described Adapted PageRank and FolkRank algorithms . Furthermore , we report results for a MostPopular item recommender as well as for a tag aware item recommender ( MostPopularT ) that ranks items according to their previous co occurrence with the query tag , but does not perform any personalization .
7.3 Results
The Recall and Precision values for the first 20 ranks and for all search methods are displayed in Figure 5 . Both plots demonstrate a superior result quality for our translation approach ( U CT M ) . The query tag translation improves the Recall@10 by about 15 percent on Bibsonomy and 18 percent on Delicious compared to the M ostP opularT baseline method . Our translational model also performs better than the F olkRank algorithm , yielding Recall@10 improvements of 7.5 percent and 10 percent . This becomes even more meaningful if we consider that the F olkRank algorithm incorporates collaborative filtering information , eg information about users with similar bookmarking patterns , whereas our approach personalizes solely by trying to understand the user ’s search intention . Similar to the tag recommendation task , we find the AdaptedP ageRank algorithm to perform worse than simple baseline methods .
The tag recommendation scenario has shown that global tag distributions can be translated to local , user level distributions . The good results of our approach in the social search scenario , on the other hand , show that this translation can be performed in both directions , resulting in better user models and an improved awareness of user intentions . The prediction task in this search setup reoccurs in other application scenarios , such as the topic aware recommendation of items or the topic aware detection of new content . We believe that our translation approach can also help to identify user interests in these scenarios .
8 . CONCLUSIONS
This work investigated the nature of tagging within folksonomies from a user centric perspective . Our studies on two real world social bookmarking services revealed that users who tag for content categorization develop distinct tag vocabularies over time . This heterogeneity vanishes when the tags of many users are aggregated , resulting in characteristic tag distributions for resources . However , the personal aspect of tagging cannot be ignored in user centric scenarios , such as tag recommendation or tag based search .
We presented a novel approach to tag translation , which maps user tags to the global folksonomy vocabulary using the labeled resources as intermediates . Based on these mappings , we were able to infer the meaning of a user tag and to accurately predict which tags a user will assign to new content . We evaluated the applicability of our approach in two relevant use cases : tag recommendation and tag based social search . Our experiments reveal that tag translation improves prediction accuracy in both scenarios .
This paper focused on tagging in broad folksonomies where tags can be assigned by the entire community and users mainly tag for content organization . In future work we plan to extend our investigations to narrow folksonomies that exhibit flat tag distributions and display different tagging motivations . Narrow folksonomies would especially benefit from tag translation , since here user level peculiarities in tagging are not compensated by aggregative effects which hinders the tag based indexing of resources . Further , we want to obtain a better understanding of how shifts in user interests are reflected in a user ’s tagging behavior . Understanding this relationship will allow for the design of more accurate user models , which in turn can help improve the quality of many services .
