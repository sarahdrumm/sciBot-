ABSTRACT Massive Open Online Courses ( MOOCs ) , which collect complete records of all student interactions in an online learning environment , offer us an unprecedented opportunity to analyze students’ learning behavior at a very fine granularity than ever before .
Using dataset from xuetangX , one of the largest MOOCs from China , we analyze key factors that influence students’ engagement in MOOCs and study to what extent we could infer a student ’s learning effectiveness . We observe significant behavioral heterogeneity in students’ course selection as well as their learning patterns . For example , students who exert higher effort and ask more questions are not necessarily more likely to get certificates . Additionally , the probability that a student obtains the course certificate increases dramatically ( 3 . higher ) when she has one or more “ certificate friends ” .
Moreover , we develop a unified model to predict students’ learning effectiveness , by incorporating user demographics , forum activities , and learning behavior . We demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms ( +203 903 % by F1 score ) several alternative methods in predicting students’ performance on assignments and course certificates . The model is flexible and can be applied to various settings . For example , we are deploying a new feature into xuetangX to help teachers dynamically optimize the teaching process .

INTRODUCTION
Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) have become increasingly popular and offered students around the world the opportunity to take online courses from prestigious universities . Three pioneer MOOC platforms—Coursera , edX , and Udacity—offer hundreds of courses and draw more than 100,000 registrants per course [ 25 ] . 2012 was called “ The Year of the MOOC ” by New York Times [ 23 ] . Following the three pioneers , many other platforms have also been developed quickly around the world , such as c⃝ 2016 ACM . ISBN 978 1 4503 3716 8/16/02 $1500

Khan Academy in North America , Miriada and Spanish MOOC in Spain , Iversity in German , FutureLearn in England , Open2Study in Australia , Fun in France , Veduca in Brazil , Schoo in Japan , and xuetangX in China . MOOCs are without doubt leading a revolution of education , by gathering global education resources and restructuring the learning environment , eg , providing online forums to geographically dispersed students . Furthermore , as all students’ learning behavior occurs online , it enables us to evaluate students’ performance in a more objective and quantitative way . For example , KDD CUP 2015 used the MOOC data to offer a challenge of predicting students’ dropout rate among a number of courses.1
MOOC platforms collect complete records of students’ online activities , which enables us to take a closer look at students’ learning behavior than ever before . However , new challenges have also emerged . For example , the low completion rates of MOOC participants—preliminary statistics show that less than 5 % of the participants have completed a course—has been a central criticism [ 16 , 25 ] . Moreover , MOOC is not just a place for teaching or learning . It also provides an interactive platform to support group level interactions among students , lecturers , and teaching assistants . Students with various motivations to study MOOCs [ 2 ] have very different learning behavioral patterns , and these online learning behavior may also deviate from those in traditional learning environments . Therefore , there is a clear need to understand user behavior in MOOCs , and more importantly , to design effective mechanisms to motivate more participation in both courses learning and social interaction .
In this paper , we focus on studying how students engage in MOOCs and to what extent we can predict their learning behavior . Understanding the complex and subtle forces underlying the learning process can significantly help design better courses and improve the learning effectiveness . More specifically , how to retain students in a course ? How to estimate the completion rate of a course ? How to evaluate the learning performance of different students ? Despite several relevant studies , such as course completion analysis [ 16 ] , learning behavior analysis [ 25 ] , and student classification and engagement analysis [ 2 ] , there are few systematical studies on modeling students’ learning behavior for different categories of courses .
Employing xuetangX,2 one of the largest MOOC platform from China , as the basis of our study , we systematically investigate the aforementioned problem . We first conduct an in depth analysis to understand the degree to which user demographics ( gender , age , and education background ) influence students’ forum activities and learning behavior including watching videos and working on assignments . Moreover , we estimate each of the three factors’ im

Please refer to § 4 for definitions of the comparative methods . portance on students’ learning performance , eg , the likelihood of getting certificates . We have several intriguing discoveries . First , hard working and frequent questioning do not necessarily imply high learning performance . Second , engaging in the course forum is a significant indicator for students’ learning performance . Third , homophily [ 18 ] — the idea that similarity and connection tend to co occur , or “ birds of a feather flock together ” [ 20 ] — plays an important role for predicting students’ learning behavior . The probability that a student obtains the course certificate increases dramatically ( 3 . higher ) when she has one or more “ certificate friends ” . We then propose a latent dynamic factor graph ( LadFG ) to model and predict learning behavior in MOOCs . The model incorporates students’ demographics , forum activities , and learning behavior into a unified framework . It captures the dynamic information and homophily correlations between students , and projects students’ learning behavior into a latent continuous space . Although the model is general enough to be applied to various settings , we particularly consider two prediction tasks : assignment grade prediction and certificate earner prediction . The former predicts students’ performance on assignment , while the latter predicts which students could get the certificates after a course ends . Figure 1 shows the performance of different comparison methods for the two prediction tasks on both science courses and non science courses . Clearly , the proposed method improves the prediction accuracy by up to 9.03 % over the alternative methods . Based on the results of the proposed model , we are deploying a new feature into the xuetangX system to help lecturers optimize their teaching process .

Data . Our data comes from xuetangX , a partner of edX . The system was launched in October 2013 and up to November 2015 , it has offered 670 courses ( including courses from Tsinghua University , Peking University , and edX courses from MIT , Stanford , UC Berkeley , etc . ) and attracted 1,700,000 registered users . The dataset used in this paper consists of 11 completed courses in the Fall 2013 and Spring 2014 semesters . We categorize the courses into two types : science ( Computer Science and Electronic Engineering ) vs . non science ( Economics , History , and Sports ) courses . The average number of registered users for the science courses is lower than that of the non science courses , though the difference is not statistically significant ( 5,911 vs . 12,959 , p = 0.247 , twosided t tests ) . Each course has a discussion forum for students to post/reply questions and to interact with each other . The dataset also consists of multiple types of students’ activities such as watching videos , working on assignments , downloading resources and etc . In total , there are 56,800,000 time stamped activity logs . Table 1 reports summary statistics of the dataset .
We first conduct a regression analysis to examine correlation between student demographics and course selection . Regarding demographics , we consider gender , education ( graduate degree including master and PhD , bachelor , and those with degree below bachelor ) , and age . As age and education are significantly and positively correlated ( p = 0.000 , chi square test ) , we focus on education here . Figure 2 shows regression results from a linear probability model of course enrollment.3 The dependent variable is whether user vi registers a course . The independent variables are ( 1 ) female dummy and ( 2 ) education level dummies including 3We present the linear probability model as it is easier for results interpretation . All results are robust when probit or logit models are used .

Additionally , we control for age and course characteristics by including course category and estimated weekly hours in learning . From the results , we observe that compared to male students , females are significantly more likely to take non science courses ( p < 0.01 ) , and less likely to choose science courses ( p < 001 ) Moreover , compared to users with low education ( <bachelor ) , bachelors are significantly more likely to take non science courses ( p < 0.01 ) , and significantly less likely to choose science courses ( p < 001 ) In contrast , graduate students are significantly more likely to take science courses ( p < 005 )
Organization . Section 2 presents pattern analysis for student activities ; Section 3 formulates the problem and presents the proposed model ; Section 4 presents the experimental results ; Section 5 discusses related work and Section 6 concludes the work . 2 . PATTERNS OF STUDENT ACTIVITY
In this section , we investigate students’ learning activities including forum activities and time spent on videos and assignments . Moreover , we examine how each of these factors affects a user ’s likelihood of getting certificates , ie , a student ’s final grade in a course is at least 60 out of 100 .
Several common features apply throughout our regression analysis . First , robust standard errors are reported in parentheses . Second , two sided p values are reported and significant at : * 10 % ; ** 5 % ; *** 1 % . Third , age and course type dummies are controlled in all regressions . Finally , in all regression analyses , we consider ordinary least squares ( OLS ) models . 2.1 Learning Activity Patterns
We first study users’ participation pattern of forum activities including posting new threads and replying to questions . Second , we study their learning behavior for watching videos and doing assignments . Engagement patterns of forum activity . In course forums , students can post new questions and answer existing questions . Overall , the level of forum activities is very low : 94 % users in our sample never participate in posting or replying to questions . Additionally , among active users , their forum activities decrease with time ( p < 0.05 ) for all but new post in science courses ( p > 0.1 ) , suggesting that users’ participation enthusiasm in courses decays over time . This observation is consistent with that in previous studies [ 2 , 25 ] .
We present ordinary least squares ( OLS ) estimates of the relationship between student characteristics and the number of forum activities in Table 2 . The dependent variable is the number of new posts ( Columns 1 and 3 ) or replies ( Columns 2 and 4 ) per student , and the independent variables include gender , education level , and the required effort level for a course ( specified by the teacher ) . It is interesting that women are only more active in asking questions in non science courses , while they are much more quiet in science courses . Within non science courses ( Columns 1 and 2 ) , women post significantly more questions than men ( p < 0.01 ) , though they reply marginally significantly fewer questions ( p < 01 ) In contrast , their amount of new post in science courses is significantly less than male students ( Column 3 , p < 005 )
Pertaining to forum activities between students with different education levels , we find that bachelors post significantly more questions in non science courses ( Column 1 ) . In contrast , graduate students do not ask many questions while their amount of replies in science courses is marginally significantly higher than those with degrees below bachelor ( Column 4 , p < 01 ) The effect size is also

Obs . R2 higher than that for bachelors ( 0.306 vs . 0.074 , p = 0.105 ) , which indicates that people with different education levels may play different roles in forums . In addition , within non science courses , users post more questions when a course requires more working hours ( Column 1 , p < 001 ) However , the amount of replies is significantly negatively correlated with course effort requirements ( Column 2 , p < 001 ) One explanation is that more difficult courses may induce more questions , while these questions may be more challenging for users to answer .
Engagement patterns of videos and assignments . First , we define user vi ’s effective learning time below .
Definition 1 . Effective learning time . It represents the actual ( or valid ) time that a student spends on watching videos and working on assignments .
In practice , it is difficult to accurately measure students’ study time [ 8 ] . For example , after a student clicks a video , she may leave and work on something else . Therefore , we design an algorithm based on deterministic finite automaton to approximate effective learning time . Specifically , we define three states : idle , video , and
95 assignment , in the state automaton . The automaton starts with idle , and changes states when it receives certain activities triggered by students . For example , when the student triggers a “ play video ” activity , the state changes from idle to video . While a “ pause ” activity changes the state back to idle . Altogether , the duration between two activities will be counted as the effective learning time . In addition , there is threshold triggered transition from any states to idle . The idea is that if a student stays in a state , eg , video , for a long time ( longer than a threshold),4 the automaton moves back to idle .
Applying the algorithm described above , we estimate each user ’s effective learning time on a certain course . Similar to forum activities , time spent on videos and assignments is extremely few . Specifically , the median time for watching videos is 4.53 minutes per course and 0 for working on assignments . In fact , 36 % users never watch videos , and 52 % of them never do assignments , suggesting that doing assignments requires more effort from users . In addition , for users who have active learning records , the amount of video and assignment related activities increases in time ( p < 0.01 ) for all but assignments in non science courses ( p > 01 ) We suspect that students may only spend time on learning when the deadline approaches .
We report regression results of users’ effective learning time in Table 3 . First , compared to male students , female students spend significantly more time on both videos and assignments in non science courses ( Columns 1 2 ) , while they spend significantly less time on both activities in science courses ( Columns 34 ) . Again , this echoes our prior findings on gender differences in both course selection and forum activities . Second , for both science and non science courses , bachelors work hardest among all education groups , and the effect size is significantly stronger for science courses than non science course ( video : 8.032 vs . 1.019 , p = 0.003 ; assignment : 8.946 vs . 1.123 , p = 0000 ) Graduate students spend least time on study in non science courses ( Columns 1 2 ) . In science courses , though their effort is higher than those with degrees below bachelors , it is still lower than that for bachelors ( video : 6.945 vs . 8.032 , p = 0.648 ; assignment : 4.817 vs . 8.946 , p = 0076 ) Additionally , when the course requires higher effort , students spend significantly more time on assignments ( Column 2 ) . Surprisingly , they spend significantly less time on videos ( Column 1 ) . One possibility is that the time spent on videos is also correlated with unobserved course characteristics , eg , the length of videos . 2.2 Certificate Rate
Now , we examine whether the likelihood of getting the certificate is correlated with user demographics , forum activities and effective learning time . Overall , among 11 courses in our data , the certification rate lies between 0.84 % and 1495 % The average certification rate for science courses is lower than that in non science courses , though the difference is not statistically significant ( 1.11 % vs . 4.68 % , p = 0.178 , two sided t tests ) .
Table 4 summarizes results from linear probability models . In the first model specification ( Columns 1 2 ) , we only include demographic information used in prior regressions , and we control for forum activities and effective learning time in the second model ( Columns 3 4 ) . First , we find that compared to male students , females are significantly more likely to get the certificate in nonscience courses ( Column 1 of Model 1 ) ; however , the size of the gender difference decreases significantly after we control for forum activities and effective learning time in Model 2 ( 0.014 vs . 0.002 , p = 0.000 , chi square test ) . This suggests that the superiority of 4In our implementation , we set the threshold to 20 minutes based on human feedback .

Second , compared to students with degrees below bachelors , bachelors are significantly more likely to get the certificate in nonscience courses and the result is robust in both models ( Columns 1 and 3 , p < 0.01 ) , while their high effort on science courses does not transform to significantly higher certificate rate.5 Surprisingly , graduate students are also significantly more likely to get the certificate in non science courses ( Column 1 : 0.007 , p < 0.01 ) , although their effective learning time is significantly lower than others . Moreover , after controlling for effort , the size of the effect is almost doubled ( Column 3 : 0.013 , p < 001 ) This implies that the certificate rate is not only related to effort , but also ability and existing knowledge level . In particular , for graduate students who may have higher learning ability , once they exert effort , they have a higher chance to get certificates . Additionally , the required effort level for a course is significantly and negatively correlated with the likelihood of getting certificates ( Columns 1 and 3 ) .
Last but not least , we discuss effect of forum activities and effective learning time on certificate rate . Specifically , both forum activities are good predictors for getting certificates . In non science courses , the size of the effect between posting and replying questions is about the same ( 0.004 vs . 0.004 , p = 0.837 , F test ) . In contrast , in science courses , posting questions matters more than answering them ( 0.038 vs . 0.001 , p = 0.000 , F test ) , suggesting that students who ask questions are more likely to get certificates than those who answer questions . Moreover , in both two types of courses , the amount of time spent on videos and assignments are significantly positively correlated with certificate rates,6 although the magnitude of the effect is very small .
5The effect is positive and marginally significant in Model 1 and it becomes negative and insignificant in Model 2 . 6The only insignificance is the effect of video time in science courses .
96 Definition 2 . Learning Activity : Let Y 2 f0 , 1gTNn be a tensor , with each element Yt,i,j representing the jth activity by student vi 2 V at time t , where T is the number of time stamps and n is the number of activities .
The activity space includes all activities ( eg , doing assignments and getting certificates ) that we are interested in . We use a n,dimensional vector Y t(i ) = [ Yt,i,0 , Yt,i,1 , : : : , Yt,i,n,1]T to represent all activities performed by student vi at time t . Moreover , we introduce the definition of latent learning state .
Definition 3 . Latent Learning State : For each student vi at time t , we define a m,dimensional vector of continuous latent states Z t(i ) = [ Zt,i,0 , Zt,i,1 , : : : , Zt,i,m,1]T , with Zt,i,j 2 [ 0 , 1 ] . Latent states of all students at all time stamps are recorded in a tensor Z 2 [ 0 , 1]TNm [
] To facilitate model description , we define Zt,1 t,p(i ) = T 2 [ 0 , 1]m.p as the vector Z t,1(i)T , Z t,2(i)T , : : : , Z t,p(i)T of latent states of student vi in the previous p time stamps . Finally , for modeling student behavior , we define attributes ( features ) for students in different time stamps as follows .
Definition 4 . Time varying Attribute Tensor : Let X 2 RTNd be a tensor in which Xt,i,j represents the jth attribute of student vi at time t , and d is the number of defined attributes ( features ) . We use a d dimensional vector X t(i ) = [ Xt,i,0 , Xt,i,1 , : : : , Xt,i,d,1]T to represent the attribute values of student vi at time t .
The attribute tensor includes all possible attributes associated to students at different time stamps , eg , demographics and all behavior except the defined learning activities.7 The attributes may not change over time , eg , gender . In this case , we have X 0(i ) = X 1(i ) = = X ( T,1)(i ) .
Our goal for modeling learning behavior is to find a mapping from students’ attribute tensor to the observed learning activities . Instead of directly learning the mapping , we use latent learning states as the bridge to connect the two sets of observation variables . Based on this idea , we propose a latent dynamic factor graph ( LadFG ) model . 3.2 Latent Dynamic Factor Graph Model
Figure 4 shows the graphical representation of the LadFG model . Each student is associated with a feature vector X t(i ) and a set of activities Y t(i ) for time t . We use latent states Z t(i ) to model students’ activities and features . In Figure 4 , each group of circles stands for a student ’s latent learning states Z t(i ) = [ Zt,i,0, , Zt,i,m,1 ] at time t , which is used to characterize the intention of the student to perform different activities . Each group of latent states is associated with an activity vector Y t(i ) , a vector of attributes X t(i ) , and it depends on the student ’s historic learning states Zt,1 t,p(i ) in previous p time stamps . Furthermore , f ( WdSt(i ) + bd ) denotes a factor function to capture the dynamic dependency . The method of modeling students’ activities using latent states is similar to the assumption in Dynamic Factor Graph ( DFG ) [ 21 ] , Markov Decision Process ( MDP ) [ 14 ] , and Deep Learning [ 13 ] . Activity correlations between students are also modeled in the latent state space using function f ( ) Different from traditional models , we also model a long distance 7In different prediction applications , the defined learning activities and attribute tensor may be different .
( a ) Forum Activity
( b ) Certificate Rate
Figure 3 : Forum Activity and Certificate Rate for Active Users .
As the distribution of forum activities is highly skewed , our findings might be contaminated by the large number of inactive users . As a robustness check , we focus on the active users , eg , those who have posted at least one thread in the forum . Overall , the relationship between forum activities and certificate rate is still positive and significant , with a slight decline in magnitude . It implies that to improve the likelihood of getting certificates , it is more important to be present and participate , while the intensity of participation , for instance posting another thread , matters less . This is supported by Figure 3(a ) , in which we plot the percentage of students obtaining a certificate by the number of forum threads they post . Clearly , the certificate rate increases sharply with the first few posts , but the benefit from further incremental activities becomes smaller . Another empirical finding is the spillover effect . We define a “ certificate friends" dummy which is coded as 1 if a user interacts with other students who finally get certificates , and it is significantly positively correlated with users’ likelihood of getting certificates , suggesting the importance of homophily correlation and positive learning spillover from well performed students .
Summary . In summary , we have the following observations : ffl Female students are more likely to ask questions in nonscience course forums , though not necessarily reply more questions . They also spend more time on watching videos and working on assignments for non science courses . ffl Bachelors ask more questions , especially in non science courses . Interestingly , graduate students are not as active as bachelors in terms of asking questions , but they are quite active in answering questions , especially in science courses . ffl Both forum activities and effective learning are significant predictors for certificate rate , suggesting the importance of encouraging students to participate in forum discussions .
3 . MODEL FRAMEWORK
Now , we turn to discuss how to model the learning behavioral data . We propose a latent dynamic factor graph ( LadFG ) model to address the problem . The model incorporates observed learning activities , including forum activities , watching videos , and doing assignments , into a unified framework . Different from previous research on factor graph model [ 26 ] , in LadFG , we use a latent learning state to model students’ learning state . Based on the modeling results , we will introduce how to apply the model to predict students’ learning behavior . 3.1 Formulation To present the model precisely , we introduce some necessary notations . Let V denote a set of jV j = N students . We first define students’ observed learning activities as follows :

As the objective function has a closed form solution , it can be learned efficiently by the gradient descent method , eg stochastic gradient descent ( SGD ) . 3.3 Model Learning
We have two sets of learning variables : model parameters . and latent states Z . To learn these parameters , we use an EM style algorithm to achieve the minimization of the objective function ( Eq 4 ) iteratively . The learning algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 1 . Specifically , there are two major steps :
1 . E step : fix all model parameters . and update Z , by using a gradient descent method .
2 . M step : fix all latent states Z and update each model param eter in
@i
Each parameter is updated by i i + @O
, where is the learning step . The gradient of each parameter wrt the objective function can be derived in the following ways . We use Zt,i,j and Wdu,v as the example to explain the gradient , and omitted others due to space limitation . @O p∑ @Zt,i,j , 2 n,1∑

Figure 4 : Graphical Representation of the LadFG Model . Each group of circles stands for a student ’s latent learning states Zt(i ) at time t , which is used to characterize the intention of the student to perform activities Y t(i ) ; each group of latent states is associated with an activity vector Y t(i ) , a vector of attributes X t(i ) , and depends on the student ’s historic learning states Zt,1 t,p(i ) in previous p time stamps ; f ( WdSt(i ) + bd ) and f ( WoZt(i ) + bo ) denote two factors to capture the latent learning states and dynamic dependency , respectively . dependency—a student ’s latent state can depend on her states in previous p time stamps .
In the LadFG model , we use function f ( . ) to capture correlations between different ( observed or latent ) variables . For simplicity , we use logistic regressions to model the dependency , although it can be replaced by any other functions . Specifically , we define f as a sigmoid function f ( z ) =
1
1 + e,z .
Moreover , for latent state Z t(i ) , LadFG models the observed learning activities Y t(i ) by : fi Y t(i )
= f ( WoZt(i ) + bo )
( 1 ) where Wo 2 Rn.m , bo 2 Rn are observation model parameters . The dynamic model establishes a time dependent correlation between a sequence of p past latent state Zt,1 t,p(i ) , attributes X t(i ) and latent state Z t(i ) . For easy explanation , we define inputs of ] dynamic model as :
[
St(i ) =
Zt,1 t,p(i )
T

Then the latent states can be obtained by : fi Zt(i )

Based on all parameters above , we define the objective function

Feature Definition and Implementations . Our implementation of learning algorithm is based on the machine learning framework Theano [ 3 , 5 ] . To train the LadFG model , we mainly define three categories of features .
Non Science ffl Demographics : These features are derived from students attributes including : gender , age , education . We consider binary features for each discrete value of every attribute , and in total we have eighteen demographics based features . ffl Forum : These features are derived from forum activities , respectively representing the number of different forum activities , the number of replies received from other students , etc . We also consider some homophily correlation features such as the number of replies received from well performed students . There are six forum activity based features . ffl Learning Behavior : These features include a list of statistical features such as the number of chapters a student browses , the number of deadlines she completes and the total time she spends on watching videos and doing assignments . In total , there are ten features defined in this category .
4 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The proposed method for modeling students’ learning behavior is very general and can be applied to different settings in MOOCs . Furthermore , using data from xuetangX , we present various experiments in this section to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method . All datasets and codes will be publicly available . 4.1 Experimental Setup Evaluation Aspects . model , we consider the following performance measurements :
To quantitatively evaluate the proposed ffl Assignment Grade Prediction . We apply our methods to the MOOC data to predict students’ grades on assignments and compare different methods . Specifically , each course has multiple assignments and a student will get a grade after completing an assignment . Our goal is to predict students’ grade for each assignment . We cast the prediction task as a binary classification problem , eg , for non science courses , “ Yes ” , if a student ’s grade is ranked top 30 % of all students . Otherwise , it is “ No ” .8 ffl Certificate Earner Prediction . We use our methods to model and predict whether a student will get the certificate after completing a course .
8We use 30 % as the cutoff for non science courses because on average , 30 % of students who completed at least one assignment eventually earned the course certificate . The cutoff for science courses is 10 % . ffl Parameter Sensitivity Analysis . We analyze the sensitivity of different parameters in our methods : latent dimension m , the parameter p , and model convergence .
Finally , we present results of error analysis for our method . In all experiments , we remove the “ register only ” students in our experiments.9
Comparison Methods and Evaluation Metrics . We compare our model with several alternative predictive models : ffl Logistic Regression ( LRC ) [ 19 ] : It uses logistic regressions to train a classification model and employs the classification model to make the prediction . ffl SVM [ 10 ] : It uses SVM to train the classification model and employs it to make the prediction . For SVM , we employ LIBLINEAR [ 10 ] . ffl Factorization Machines [ 1 , 17 ] : Factorization models have been proposed and successfully applied to recommendation and prediction tasks . As the factorization model projects the input feature space onto a latent space , it enables us to learn more complex interactions between features .
Altogether , we try to use the same set of features in all comparison methods . Regarding tunable parameters m , p , . , z , w and z in LadFG , we find the best configuration using cross validation ( ie , m = 5 , p = 2 , z = 0.5 , . = 0.1 , w = 0.01 and z = 001 ) Moreover , we evaluate the performance of comparison methods in terms of Area Under Curve ( AUC ) , Precision ( Prec. ) , Recall ( Rec. ) , and F1 Measure ( F1 ) [ 7 ] . Additionally , all algorithms are implemented in Python , and all experiments are performed on an x64 machine with 2.9GHz intel Core i7 CPU and 8GB RAM . 4.2 Assignment Grade Prediction
We conduct assignment grade prediction for the 11 courses in our dataset . In each course , we use the first half ( before the mid term ) of the data for training and the second half ( after the mid term ) for testing the prediction performance . Table 5 presents the average prediction performance of different methods and the largest performance numbers under each index are bolded . Overall , the proposed LadFG model clearly outperforms all alternative methods . In terms of F1 score , LadFG achieves a 160 256 % improvement compared 9It refers to students who only register a course , but never actually engage in any course activities .

For science courses , the prediction performances vary a lot and they depend on the amount of data used for training . Additionally , it seems difficult to predict grades of the last assignments in science courses .

4.3 Certificate Earner Prediction
Moreover , we use certificate earner prediction to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model . Again , we use the first half of the data ( before the mid term ) for training each method , and apply the learned model to predict whether a student would get the course certificate . Table 6 summarizes the performance of different methods for predicting certificate earners . Consistently , LadFG performs better than alternative methods . In addition , we conduct a similar feature contribution analysis for certificate earner prediction . Figure 7 shows the prediction performance of the proposed model by considering different categories of features and we have similar results as those for assignment grade prediction . 4.4 Parameter Sensitivity Analysis
We now discuss how different parameters influence the performance of our methods , as well as presenting the efficiency perfor
Figure 6 : Average Prediction Performance by Varying the Percentage of Data for Training . to SVM and LRC , neither of which considers the latent interactions between variables . Although FM which also considers the interactions between variables outperforms SVM and LRC , it cannot effectively leverage the temporal information and correlations between students . Consequently , it still underperforms LadFG . We perform two sided t tests and all the p values are < 0.01 , which indicates that the improvements of our proposed models over the comparison methods are statistically significant .
Feature Contribution Analysis . We study how different categories of features ( demographics , forum activities , and learning behavior ) help the prediction task . The learning behavior includes all activities related to watching videos and doing assignments . Specifically , each time , we respectively remove demographics , forum activities , and learning behavior when training our proposed model , and compare performance of assignment grade prediction based on the trained models . Figure 5 shows the AUC performances for each type of courses . “ All Features ” stands for the LadFG model considering all features defined in our method . “ Demographic ” , “ Forum ” , and “ Behavior ” indicate results from removing demographics , forum activities , and learning behavior , respectively . Apparently , the learning behavior features contribute significantly to the results for both types of courses . It is also worthwhile to note that learning behavior seems to be more important for modeling the non science courses . Without learning behaviorbased features , the performance of assignment grade prediction in non science courses is worse than that in science courses .
Effect of the percentage of the training data . We investigate the performance of assignment grade prediction by varying the percentage of the training data . Figure 6 shows the average prediction performance . The x axis ( k = 20 , 90 ) indicates the percentage of data we use for training . It is very interesting that non science

In all the analyses , we use the assignment grade prediction as the example , and report the average performance on non science and science courses respectively .
Effect of Latent Dimension m . We evaluate how the latent dimension m affects the quality of the models learned by LadFG . We perform an analysis by varying the dimension of latent space in the proposed LadFG method . Figure 8(a ) shows its AUC performance with different numbers of topics . We find that LadFG results in a better performance when the latent dimension is smaller than 20 . In addition , increasing the dimension results in a performance drop and this might be due to the data sparsity .
Effect of Parameter p . Pertaining to the parameter p , Figure 8(b ) shows the performance of LadFG with different p ( other parameters are fixed , eg , m = 5 ) . Although the performance changes when we vary the value of p , the best performance is obtained when p = 2 ( by considering latent states of two previous time stamps ) .
Convergence analysis . We further investigate the convergence of the learning algorithm for LadFG . Figure 8(c ) presents the convergence analysis of the algorithm . The algorithm converges within 500 iterations . Furthermore , this rapid convergence enables us to do efficient training of the model on large scale datasets .
Efficiency . We compare the efficiency of the different methods . Table 7 lists the average running time of the comparison algorithms for training the prediction models . Overall , all methods have good efficiency performance , and the running time of different methods ranges from seconds to minutes . LadFG results in a slightly lower efficiency compared with FM . 4.5 Error Analysis
In the end , we conduct an error analysis on the results of our approach and observe three major types of errors .
( 1 ) Unpredictable negative cases . The proposed LadFG model fails in the following scenario in which a substantial proportion is credited to final exams in certain courses . Some active learners , who engage in forums and lectures enthusiastically , may not take tests due to personal reasons , eg , scheduling conflicts , and they would be misclassified into certificated group .
( 2 ) Unpredictable positive cases . In contrast , some inactive students never participate in forums and have very few learning activities . However , they still complete assignments ( or pass the final exams ) with extremely high scores , and they are incorrectly grouped to be low grade in the assignment grade prediction ( or uncertificated in the certificate earner prediction ) . We randomly choose several of those students and conduct interviews with them . We find that a substantial proportion of them are very skillful undergraduate or graduate students who have taken similar courses offline . Therefore , they are capable of taking online tests without spending much effort .
( 3 ) Swing cases . LadFG would become ineffective for certificate earner prediction on “ swing ” cases as well . Each course has a minimum passing score , above which the student would be certificated . Swing cases are those students whose scores are hovering around the minimum score . Our model would misclassify these swing cases and draw a wrong conclusion .
5 . RELATED WORK
MOOCs boom swiftly in recent years and have attracted millions of users worldwide . Experiences in offline education which predict dropouts and school failures do not fully satisfy the need in MOOCs . Analyzing and mining the big data from online courses becomes an important topic to understand students’ behavior . We review related literature in three topics : attribute analysis , engagement analysis and time related feature analysis . Attribute analysis : This line of researches mainly focuses on studying the relationship between user demographic attributes and their behavioral patterns in online courses . For example , Guo et al.[11 ] investigated how navigation strategies vary by demographics . Based on demographic results , Wilkowski et al.[27 ] found no correlation between prior skills and course completion rates . Furthermore , their study showed that students who completed course activities were more likely to earn certificates than those who did not . Moreover , Seaton et al.[25 ] examined activities that help students get certificates . Engagement analysis : More and more researchers start to analyze students’ engagement in courses . For online open courses , Anderson et al.[2 ] developed a taxonomy of individual engagement style , and there was a further discussion between student engagement and their grades . Since student dropouts in MOOCs have gathered widespread attention , Ramesh et al.[24 ] proposed a latent representation model which could be applied to abstract student engagement types and to predict dropouts . Additionally , for traditional courses , Bayer et al.[4 ] predicted dropouts and school failures when student data has been enriched with data derived from students’ social behavior . Related studies can be also found in [ 12 , 22 ] . However , most existing research on engagement shared similarities with Champaign et al . ’s work[8 ] . They estimated time spent

Forum analysis : Several interesting work examines MOOC forums , which plays an important role in online learning . Chaturvedi et al.[9 ] predicted instructor ’s intervention in forums . Brinton et al.[6 ] investigated factors correlated with the decline of forum activities , and found strategies to classify and rank thread relevance . Additionally , Huang[15 ] explored super posters on forums and studied their engagement patterns . They found that super posters display above average engagement , enroll in more courses , and obtain better grades than the average forum participants . However , these studies might isolate and overstate the importance of forum performance .
To the best of our knowledge , there was little work utilizing temporal correlations between demographics , forum behaviors , and learning activity patterns to model and predict assignment grade performance and certificate earners . 6 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we study a novel problem of modeling and predicting learning behavior in MOOCs . We conduct in depth analysis for student demographics , and learning activity patterns in course forums , videos and assignments . We propose a latent dynamic factor graph ( LadFG ) to incorporates students’ demographics , forum activities , and learning behavior into a unified framework . Our experimental results on two prediction tasks : assignment performance prediction and certificate earner prediction , validate the effectiveness of the proposed model .
The general idea in this paper , to model and predict learning behavior in MOOCs , represents an interesting and new research direction . There are many potential future directions for this work . A straightforward task would be to incorporate human feedback into the proposed model . Other courses and more information on users would also be worth exploring . Looking further ahead , we believe that different models and semi supervised learning algorithms for exploring social network structures should be beneficial . Finally , building a theory of why and how students join and quit different courses is an intriguing direction for future research .
