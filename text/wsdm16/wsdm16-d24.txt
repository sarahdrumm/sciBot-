ABSTRACT The cumulative effect of collective online participation has an important and adverse impact on individual privacy . As an online system evolves over time , new digital traces of individual behavior may uncover previously hidden statistical links between an individual ’s past actions and her private traits . To quantify this effect , we analyze the evolution of individual privacy loss by studying the edit history of Wikipedia over 13 years , including more than 117,523 different users performing 188,805,088 edits . We trace each Wikipedia ’s contributor using apparently harmless features , such as the number of edits performed on predefined broad categories in a given time period ( eg Mathematics , Culture or Nature ) . We show that even at this unspecific level of behavior description , it is possible to use off the shelf machine learning algorithms to uncover usually undisclosed personal traits , such as gender , religion or education . We provide empirical evidence that the prediction accuracy for almost all private traits consistently improves over time . Surprisingly , the prediction performance for users who stopped editing after a given time still improves . The activities performed by new users seem to have contributed more to this effect than additional activities from existing ( but still active ) users . Insights from this work should help users , system designers , and policy makers understand and make long term design choices in online content creation systems . Keywords online privacy , de anonymization , temporal loss of privacy .

INTRODUCTION
Privacy is a relatively new concern of modern society [ 14 ] . Historically , compromising one ’s privacy was a difficult task , being mainly achieved by using constant physical surveillance , costly by nature , and easy to thwart . The advent of the online environment has changed the privacy landscape : users of social network , blogging , microblogging plat∗Corresponding author : marian andrei@rizoiu.eu forms willingly or unwillingly share information with the public and with organizations . The general public are already aware [ 4 , 16 ] that information inadvertently left online can hurt privacy , and researchers showed that [ 12 ] personal attributes can be predicted from these online behavioral traces . However , the longitudinal change of privacy loss is not well understood – namely , how information collected over several years can compromise privacy , and how the predictability of private attributes evolve . In this paper , we set out to answer such challenging questions by curating a novel large scale behavioral trace dataset , and by measuring the predictability of personal traits in a number of ways .
We construct a new dataset from all editing activities in and around Wikipedia – the largest encyclopedia to date collaboratively constructed by hundreds of thousands of users . We use as input each user aggregated editing activities in a number of broadly defined content and community categories , and the target output are personal traits from Wikipedia badges , ie , what users choose to disclose on their personal pages . This problem and system setting allows us to make several key observations : ( 1 ) We show that Wikipedia editors’ private traits can be inferred using off the shelf machine learning algorithms , and that the prediction performance consistently improves over our prediction period from 2007 to 2013 . In particular , our results include predicting an individual ’s gender , educational status and religious views . Among the different personal attributes , a subset of showed high prediction accuracy as measured by the equal precisionrecall metric – namely , the editors’ gender at 0.79 , practicing muslim religion at 0.9 or being jewish at 091 ( 2 ) We quantify the effect of different features using a temporal measure called information transfer . We observe that while the marginal utility of newer features decreases over time , the new users consistently add additional information for the prediction tasks . ( 3 ) We show that the prediction of private attributes continues to improve for users who exited the system – or stopped editing after 2007 . The continued loss of privacy for these users seems to be associated with two quantifiable factors : the information learned from a user ’s own activity ( or online breadcrumbs ) and the activity of other editors .
To the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to quantify longitudinal change in privacy loss , carried out on a large dataset and over more than 13 years . Not only do we show that private traits can be predicted increasingly well with time , we also provide several methods to quantify the value of new information over time , and the different source of information loss from more activity or more users . Our findings suggest privacy continues to erode for all users , even after one stops publishing data online . Our findings also can help design data storage and retention policies , can make users aware of the implications of seemingly harmless online activities , and adds to the very lively research topic about online privacy .
2 . RELATED WORK
The value of privacy . Social scientists have been interested in how individuals perceive and values their privacy . Acquisiti et al . [ 2 ] revealed that the perceived value of privacy , while not entirely arbitrary , is highly malleable . For example , there is a large gap between the amount of money that individuals would accept to disclose private information and the amount of money they would pay to protect it . Furthermore , certain categories seem particularly vulnerable to the online privacy issue . Young adults have been shown [ 5 ] to be as worried about their privacy as older adults , especially in what concerns giving personal information to businesses , having photos of them uploaded to the internet or the legislation protecting privacy . On the contrary , Hoofnagle et al . [ 10 ] found that young adults tend to expose themselves more , especially on popular social networks , because they are less aware of the risks , less informed about the protection given by law and more prone to social peer pressure . Our work can contribute to the public understanding of privacy risks , by studying on public open data and with quantifiable outcomes .
Privacy Loss and inferring private traits . One definition of Personal Identifiable Information ( PII ) is private information relating to a person , which can be deductively identified , based on the person ’s public profile [ 19 ] . This is a source of concern particularly in the context of the Open Data effort of governments , in which anonymous datasets are released publicly , after removing private attributes such as name and contact information . The literature shows many applications in which private information , which was never intended to be publicly released , can be inferred from apparently harmless data . In one notorious example , the medical condition of an American politician was inferred starting from anonymized medical records released to the public [ 23 ] . Researchers found that de anonymization can be carried out in large scale . The 2011 IJCNN Social Network Challenge was won by de anonymizing the identity of the Flikr users , including those in the test set [ 18 ] . More recently , De Montjoye et al . [ 7 ] showed that only four spatio temporal points are enough to identify 95 % of individual trajectories using mobile carrier ’s antenna information , while the same group [ 17 ] show that 90 % of individuals can be re identified using their credit card transactions trajectory .
Another salient source of private informations are patterns of online behavior . Kosinski , Stillwell and Graepel showed [ 12 ] how private traits like gender , sexual orientation , ethnic origin and even the fact that a user ’s parents have divorced before her twenty first birthday can be accurately inferred from apparently harmless , naturally revealed public data , such as Facebook likes . In another data domain , the pattern of an individual ’s online or phone activity have been shown [ 21 ] to reveal precious information about her habits and preferences . Furthermore , computer based evaluations of human personality have been shown more accurate than those of close friends [ 27 ] .
We show that private information can be extracted not only from structured anonymized datasets ( such as [ 23 ] ) or datasets rich in social information ( such as [ 12 , 21] ) , but even from data traces left for the public good , such as Wikipedia . Ramachandran and Chaintreau [ 20 ] recently studies how the structure of locally connected individuals affects privacy loss . Our focus is in the time dimension – in quantifying the temporal evolution of privacy loss .
Editing behavior in Wikipedia . Wikipedia is the largest online collaborative encyclopedia . In its early years , Wikipedia showed rapid growth . Initial studies [ 3 ] explained the growth as driven by the rapidly increasing user base . The growth of the English Wikipedia slowed after 2007 , with fewer new editors joining , and fewer new articles created . A few studies [ 8 , 22 ] explain this dynamic as Wikipedia editors face increasingly limited opportunities to make novel contributions , with the easy articles already been created , leaving only more difficult topics to write about . To make useful contributions to the site , editors must also meet an increasingly high bar of expertise in their field . In addition , Halfaker and McNeil [ 9 ] consider that Wikipedia ’s mechanisms for managing quality and consistency deterred newcomers . In our profile of Wikipedia ’s growth and decline ( Sect . 5 ) , we were surprised to see that the changes of activity over time are not uniform across content and personal demographic attributes . There is a rise in site maintenance , and some user groups showed slower decline ( PhD ) , or even a rise ( self identified muslism users ) in editing activities . Finally , while social interactions in Wikipedia have been studied before [ 6 , 26 ] , to the best of our knowledge , this is the first study of private traits that can be inferred from editing activities .
3 . WIKIPEDIA ACTIVITIES AND USER TRAITS
Why Wikipedia ? Wikipedia is an ideal data source for studying longitudinal predictability of private traits , due to the following three reasons . Firstly , it is an apparently harmless dataset , whose purpose is to be a reservoir of knowledge , with little or no focus on personal or social information . Unlike online social networks centered on users’ profiles , Wikipedia is not intended to record any individual contributor ’s personal and social interactions . Secondly , Wikipedia ’s entire edit history is publicly accessible . Wikipedia provides the longitudinal editing history for individuals , spanning over a decade – 2001–2013 at the time of our snapshot . Such a unique long temporal extent allows the study of the effect of time in online privacy . Finally , Wikipedia contributors are from many geographic locations and numerous social , religious , educational and political backgrounds – providing a rich and diverse sample for activities and candidate personal traits . We show that as Wikipedia accumulates user data and editing activity , increasing amounts of private information can be inferred ( see Sect . 6 ) .
The Wikipedia dataset . Our dataset contains 13 years of edit history , from the beginning of Wikipedia in January 2001 to July 2013 . 188,805,088 revisions are performed by 117,523 editors to 22,172,813 pages . A revision is a Wikipedia term referring to an atomic edit of a page by a user with an associated timestamp . All data used in this study are obtained from July 2013 public Wikipedia dump , more details about data processing are in the supplemental material ( SI ) [ 1 ] . For predicting private traits ( Sect . 4 and 6.1 ) we limit the studied period between 01/2007 and 07/2013 in order to have sufficient numbers of users .

User activity profiles . We encode a user ’s activity using two sets of features . In the basic set , we count the number of revisions performed in a given period of time , over six predefined categories of the edited pages . The intuition behind these features is to capture the intent of a user ’s editing effort . For example , the CONTENT feature captures edits made to main Wikipedia articles and can be associated with the knowledge creation effort . Similarly , the WIKI and INFRA features quantify the effort put into organizing the editing effort ( ie , community pages , help desks ) , while USER and TALK U captures the social components , such as constructing a personal page and talking to other users . Features in the basic set are based on the Wikipedia namespaces and a summary of their respective meanings is in Table 1 . Wikipedia namespaces are organizational categories , to encode the intended purpose of a page ( details in SI [ 1] ) . The second set of features , ie the extended set , is constructed by adding to the basic set 26 new categories based on Wikipedia ’s toplevel category hierarchy . A Wikipedia page can be assigned by its editors to one or more of the 26 thematic categories such as History , Geography , etc . The extended set provides a more detailed profiling of a users’ activity , by capturing their editing interests . Details of feature construction are described in Sect . 4 .
The editors’ personal information . Many Wikipedia users keep a user page ( resembling a social network profile ) , on which they distribute information about themselves , their interests or the causes they support . Some distribute information typically considered as private , such as their gender , ethnic origin , religion , education , or even sexual preferences . We retrieve these records using public APIs1 , and use them as target personal traits . For the purpose of this study , we selected three private traits with sufficient user bases : gender ( declared by 6936 users ) , education ( undergrads , grads and Phd , declared by 9224 users ) and religion ( christian , muslim , atheist or jewish , declared by 7685 users ) .
4 . MEASURING PRIVACY LOSS
We study the loss of privacy by modeling it as a prediction
1 https://wwwmediawikiorg/wiki/API:Users problem : how well can we predict a given a class variable Y ( ie , gender , education or religion ) using descriptive features X in the basic or extended set . By following a set of users through time , we observe the dynamics of the predictive performance . We define the temporal loss of privacy as better explaining a variable linked to a private trait , as we observe editing behaviors for longer periods of time . In this work we use two sets of tools . The first is a predictive approach : we predict the private traits of a hold out set of users on increasingly longer activity history on Wikipedia , and we observe the change in prediction accuracy . The second approach uses information transfer , a measure from physics and economics , to quantify the uncertainty in Y explained by feature X over time .
4.1 Encoding activities over time
We denote a feature X u i as computed in the timeframe i for user u , with X ∈ {CONTENT , TALK C , USER , TALK U , WIKI , INFRA} for the basic set , and encoded similarly for the extended set . We construct a series of temporal datasets , each having a 3 month period in addition to the previous . A user appears in a temporal dataset if she/he has performed at least one revision during or before the last 3 months . We construct two kinds of features over time , the instantaneous for user u in the ith 3 month period alone , and features f u i the longitudinal feature F u 1:i ] for user u – containing the series up to ( and including ) timeframe i . Features are constructed by counting the number of revisions performed by u during the given timeframe , over the predefined cati , TALK Uu egories , eg , f u i , WIKIu i describe both the past and the current activities , and contain temporally increasing quantities of information . In addition , for newly joined editors , we explicitly encode the missing values in previous timeframes . This is done by including a binary missing feature flags for each activity category , a value of 0 means an editor has joined Wikipedia ( even if she is on a pause during timeframe i ) , and 1 means the editor has not joined Wikipedia , ie missing . For the basic set , this rei = ( CONTENTu sults in additional six binary features , ie , f u i , p_Cu i , TALK Uu i , p_TUu i , WIKIu i , i ) for the basic set . Naturally , features F u i = ( CONTENTu i , TALK Cu i , USERu i , INFRAu i = [ f u i , TALK Cu i , p_TCu i , USERu i , p_Uu
3 months timeframe , it is useful to quantify the additional information contained in time period Xt that were not already contained by earlier features X1:t−1 . The Information Transfer measure , I(Y ; Xt|X1:t−1 ) , is designed for this purpose . Fig 1 illustrated the intuition behind I(Y ; Xt|X1:t−1 ) using a Venn diagram . In this example , X3 contains quite a lot of information about Y – expressed as the mutual information I(Y ; X3 ) , or the large intersection between red and blue circles . However , the new information that X3 provides , in addition to X1:2 , is much smaller – expressed as I(Y ; X3|X1:2 ) , as I(Y ; X3 ) minus the part already covered by I(Y ; X1 ) and I(Y ; X2 ) . Intuitively , information transfer is the Conditional Mutual Information of Y and Xt given X1:t−1 , or the amount of uncertainty that will be reduced after observing Xt :
I(Y ; Xt|X1:t−1 ) = H(Y |X1:t−1 ) − H(Y |X1:t ) .
The relationship above follows from the definition of mutual information and conditional entropy [ 13 ] . We implemented information transfer using the infotheo toolbox in R [ 15 ] , which computes conditional entropies and in highdimensional input spaces by quantizing the input . We use Information Transfer I(Y ; Xt|X1:t−1 ) and conditional entropies H(Y |Xt ) and H(Y |X1:t ) to answer two key questions : which features are most important in the disclosure of private information , and which time periods are critical to privacy loss .
5 . EDITING BEHAVIOUR OVER TIME
In this section , we present a profile of wikipedia editing behaviour over time . While our profile concur with the slowdown of Wikipedia [ 8 , 9 , 22 ] , our analysis detects the rise of maintenance effort and shows that different user groups contribute differently to various functional and topical sections of the encyclopedia .
The decline of editorship and rise of maintenance . It has been observed [ 8 , 9 , 22 ] that Wikipedia ’s growth slowed since 2007 , with fewer new editors joining , and fewer new articles created . Our profiling shows the same phenomenon . Fig 2 shows the number of active editors , new editors , and number of edits over time . A user is considered active in a time interval if she has submitted at least one revision in the given period . A user is considered a new users ( or a newcomer ) if she made her first revision in the given time interval . We can see that the slowdown started in 2007 , with both the active population , and the total number of revisions decreasing steadily – as seen in the volume of CONTENT revisions in Fig 2a , and revisions to the Nature section in Fig 2b . We can also see that while the overall growth rate is slowing , the increasing amounts of accumulated information require an increasing effort to organize . Fig 2c shows that the number of infrastructure related revisions ( INFRA ) continues to increase , made by a decreasing number of users . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first work to detect and quantify this rise of maintenance . Different growth trends across editor demographics . One explanation [ 8 ] for the slowdown of Wikipedia is that the easy articles have already been created . This means that in order to make a novel , useful contribution to the site , editors must meet an increasingly high bar of expertise in the field . Fig 3a plots the active population size for users with a declared education level . The three curves corresponding to undergrads , graduates and PhD have been scaled in [ 0 , 1 ] to

Even if X3 explains a large portion of the information in Y , most of Y was already explained by X1 and X2 , and the new informationX3 brings is given by the conditional mutual information I(Y ; X3|X1:2 ) . i , p_Wu i , INFRAu p_Wu i ) , where features prefixed with p_ are the missing flags of the preceding feature . For the extended set , additional features for the 26 categories are constructed in the same manner and appended to each f u i . We tried other schemes to encode user activity , such as cumulative features to encode activities from the beginning of until timeframe i , and found them to have lower performance . Therefore the rest of the paper presents only the incremental scheme . 4.2 Predicting personal attributes
We evaluate how well a private trait can be predicted by setting up a set of binary classification tasks . Multi class target variables ( ie , religion and education ) are transformed to binary prediction tasks in a one vs. all fashion ( eg , christian vs . non christian ) . We use 2:1 stratified splits to construct the training and test user subsets – 66 % of the editors are randomly selected to be part of the training set , and the remaining 33 % are used for testing , with the random sampling preserving class priors . One model is learned for each class and each time period , using logistic regression classifier with L1 regularization that favors sparse feature weights , with the hyperparameter obtained by cross validation [ 11 ] . We also tried the L2 regularizer and observed lower performances . The performance is evaluated using the AUC metric ( the area under the ROC curve ) [ 11 ] , intuitively random guess classifiers have an AUC of 0.5 , and perfect classification has 10 Accuracy and F score for predicting each private trait are given in the SI [ 1 ] . We independently sample the train/test split 10 times , and record the mean and standard deviation of the AUC . While other classifiers can be used , we have not tried them in our experiments since our interest lies in the evolution of prediction performance and not its absolute value . 4.3
Information transfer over time
Information theory measures are useful for capturing feature relevance in prediction tasks [ 13 ] . One particular measure , Information Transfer , was recently used [ 24 ] to uncover hidden links in social media . Intuitively , we capture the uncertainty of private information with the entropy of the target variable Y . The quantity of private information explained by feature X is then given by the mutual information I(Y ; X ) . Since feature X takes different values for each

Figure 5 : Temporal evolution of mean values of features , broken down by classes in each private trait . We present three selected examples of pairs ( feature , trait ) , other graphics are in the SI [ 1 ] : ( a ) ( CONTENT , education ) , ( b ) ( USER , gender ) and ( c ) ( CONTENT , religion ) . All values are computed as the number of revisions on the given category during a timeframe and expressed as percentages of the total number of revisions . The mean value over all users is presented . render them comparable . All three population show the expected initial rapid increase . The undergrads and graduates reach maximum at the same time as the general population The more specialized PhD population seems to peak much later , in early 2010 , which seems to confirm the hypothesis that the required increase in the specialization of editors is one of the factors responsible for the slowdown of Wikipedia . We can also see differing demographic trends across different groups in editors’ religion and gender . In Fig 3b , the number of christian , jewish and atheist editors start to decrease around 2007 . On the other hand , the self declared muslim population seems to continuously increase , at a slower pace than during Wikipedia ’s initial growth 2001 2007 . Fig 3c plots the number of active editors by gender , we can see that the number of active female editors started decreasing earlier than that of male editors . While gender imbalance in Wikipedia has been previously studied [ 9 ] , no other discussion of the evolution across time of gender , religion and education is present in prior literature .
Aggregated edit counts correlate with private traits .
We describe a user ’s editing activity by aggregating her revision counts over a number of predefined categories . We conduct a exploratory analysis by presenting the averages of the features , with consideration for each of the private traits . Fig 4a shows differences between the average male and female behavior : 59 % of all the revisions performed by males are CONTENT , compared to 48 % for females . Females tend to socially relate more , by writing more on USER pages ( 35 % of all revisions for females , less than 25 % for males ) . Similarly , Fig 4b presents average male ( highlighted in blue ) and female ( highlighted in red ) behavior , over features in the extended set . Females edit more subjects like Agriculture , Health , History , Language , Belief , Arts and People , while males edit more Mathematics , Society , Business , Geography and Culture . While the absolute differences between average behavior on gender tend to be rather small , they indicate a separability of the two classes . We perform a similar analysis for education ( Fig 4c ) and religion ( Fig 4d ) : undergrads create less CONTENT revisions and more USER revisions . graduates and PhD populations both dedicate a higher percentage of revisions to CONTENT . The PhD are more active on technical categories , such as Science , Mathematics , Education , Technology , Health and Applied Sciences , and the graduates edit more subjects like People , Environment ,
Culture , Society and Life . When aggregating per religion , Fig 4d shows that the jewish editors are the most prolific in all thematic sections ( the extended feature set ) , except Mathematics . muslim editors dedicate higher attention to Belief , Language , Law and INFRA , and lower attention to Arts , Education and Society . Atheist users dedicate more time editing Mathematics , Science , Nature and Culture , and less time to People and Law . This static analysis of mean behavior suggests that there are regularities in the editing patterns for each population . These could be exploited for training a classifier and predicting weather a new user belongs to any of these classes .
Evolution of editing patterns . We further study how editing patterns evolve over time . For each feature , we compute the mean number of revisions over each timeframe , broken down by class . This value is still an aggregate measure over an entire subpopulation , but it evolves temporally , therefore hinting changes in editing patterns . Fig 5 shows examples of temporal evolution for three selected pairs ( feature , private trait ) . More examples are presented in the SI [ 1 ] . Fig 5a shows the feature CONTENT differentiated over levels of education . The static pattern shown in Fig 4c is a result of change in editing patterns over time : editors with a PhD edit CONTENT more as Wikipedia matures , as also shown in the editor population breakdown in Figure 3a . For other features the editing pattern evolves over time . Contrasting Fig 5b and Fig 4a , we can see the differentiation of edits to the USER section by gender – female users edit more overall than male users , but this is only true until 2009 . TALK C and BELIEF also present the same temporal pattern shift , as shown in the SI [ 1 ] . Finally , some features present unexpected trends . Fig 5c unveils that , unlike the general trend of decreasing number of contributions , CONTENT related edits increase for muslim editors . This temporal analysis reinforces the hypothesis that user editing patterns , as well as their evolution , are differentiated along different user traits .

We quantify the privacy loss due to newcomers as the relative gain of learning performance for the two populations . fer metric to pin point the source of performance gain over time . 6.1 Predicting personal attributes over time
Predictability of private traits improves over time . We train binary predictors for every class of every private trait in our study , on datasets with increasing amounts of history ( as shown in Sec 42 ) The editors’ activity is described using the basic feature set . Fig 6 shows the AUC over time for three selected examples of private traits ( all remaining classes are in the SI [ 1] ) . The graphics show the performance of predicting the gender of editors ( Fig 6a ) , whether they are undergrads ( Fig 6b ) or of muslim religion ( Fig 6c ) . The AUC measure increases over time , roughly following a linear trend ( coefficient of determination R2 > 0.83 for all three examples ) . The AUC differences between the first and the last timeframes are statistically highly significant ( t test p < 0.001 , details and results in the SI [ 1] ) . We interpret this steady increase of performance over time as loss of privacy : as more historical information is available , the learning algorithm infers more accurately user traits which are potentially private .
We also report the model performance on an intuitive measure called equal Precision and Recall ( ePR ) , defined as where a 45 degree line from the origin intersect with the precision recall curve . For the three classes in Fig 6 , in the last timeframe , we obtain a mean ePR of 0.791 ( for gender ) , 0.535 ( for education/undergrads ) and 0.9 ( for religion/muslim ) . All the other classes and the evolution of ePR over time are found in the the SI [ 1] ) . The ePR measure allows to quantify how accurate are the predictions of certain private traits . We find that certain religious attributes have notably high prediction performance ( muslim eP R = 0.9 and jewish eP R = 0.913 ) from behavioral features .
In a similar setup , we predict user gender using the extended feature set and we plot the AUC over time in Fig 7 . Alongside , we produce the results for the basic feature set and the relative gain between the two , for each timeframe . Predictions using the extended features consistently outperform those using the basic features , showing that knowledge about thematic editing patterns is informative about user private traits . The AUC over time series for the two types of features sets are highly correlated ( Pearson correlation of 0973 ) This shows that , while adding the thematic information improves the absolute value of the prediction accuracy , it seems to have little influence on the evolution of the privacy loss . We speculate that the evolution of privacy loss is not linked to the way the data is described , but it is rather intrinsic to the online social environment . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to highlight and quantify this intrinsic cumulative effect of time over privacy .

Feature are ordered by the conditional entropy H(Y |X ) , here Y = 0/1 is the gender attribute , X is each feature . Lower is better . Basic features are shown in red , extended features in blue . ( d ) Mutual Information between each feature at time t and gender ( on NE ) . Information Transfer on Fixed Population FP ( b ) and NE ( e ) . Conditional entropy evolution on FP ( c ) and NE ( f ) . We can see that while later edits contains just as much information about a user ’s privacy as the earlier edits , they contribute less to prediction gain , since most of the information they bring was already known . vacy loss is caused by a joint effect of two factors : i ) the information learned from new users who enter the population and ii ) online breadcrumbs – a more accurate estimate of how the behavioral features correspond to personal traits . To separate these factors , we study two scenarios defined by subsets of the editor population : the “ New Entry ” ( NE ) in which new users can enter freely throughout time and “ Fixed population ” ( FP ) , which is limited only to users active in the first timeframe ( ie , first quarter of 2007 ) . In Fig 8 , we plot the AUC over time when studied on FP and we compare it to NE . The curve corresponding to FP increases over time , though slower in later timeframes . The difference between the first and last timeframe is statistically very significant – t test p < 001 Intuitively , only the online breadcrumbs could cause this privacy decay for FP . By comparison , predictions on NE are constantly more accurate and continue to notably improve beyond the initial burst detected for FP . We attribute this additional improvement to information relating to new users entering the system .
Are later edits less harmful to one ’s privacy ? Intuitively , the longer a user edits , the more she discloses about herself . We approach this issue using the Temporal Information Theory measure detailed in Sec 4 , on both FP and NE populations . Let T be the number of timeframes . Fig 9a shows the conditional entropy of the class variable Y ( here gender ) , after conditioning on all the temporal instantiations of a given feature X ( ie H(Y |X1:T ) ) , on the NE dataset . We can see which features which give out the most information about a user ’s gender . Consistent with the data profile in Sec 5 , CONTENT differentiates the most males from females .
The thematic features , like Life , Society , Nature or Culture follow , having very similar scores . Surprisingly , USER distinguishes gender less than seen from the profiling analysis . An almost identical ordering of importance of features is obtained on FP . Fig 9d presents the instantaneous mutual information over time between the gender variable and the three most important features . All three present very similar dynamics ( both on NE and on FP ) . The information overlap between the temporal instantiation of features and the private trait remains almost constant until close to the end of the studied period . This answers the questions whether later edits are less harmful , by showing that later activity hurts privacy as much as the initial activity , as it discloses similar quantities of information . We further study the amount of new information introduced features in later timeframes . Fig 9b and 9e show that the Information Transfer over time on respectively FP and NE , for the same three features . All series present an initial burst , after which they drop quickly . Note that , due to differences in the effectives of the FP and NE populations , the absolute values are not directly comparable and only their evolutions are meaningful . We can see that later features Xt bring few new information not already disclosed by the earlier features Xt−1 , Xt−2 . . The take home message for this subsection is : While later edits contain just as much information about a user ’s privacy as the earlier edits , they tend to be less harmful since most of the information they bring has already been learned .
The continuous impact of newcomers on privacy loss . Information Theory measures provide means for separately quantifying the privacy loss due “ online breadcrumbs ”

For FP ( Fig 9b ) , the utility of later edits drops to virtually zero , whereas for NE ( Fig 9e ) they decrease to a non negligible score . The information inferred from newcomers seems to be moderate , but constant in time . This information is also responsible for the continuous increase of prediction performance detected in Fig 8 for the NE population . Similar conclusions can be drawn by studying the conditional entropy over time for the two populations . For FP ( Fig 9c ) it decreases rapidly and remains constant afterwards , showing that virtually no new information is learned after the initial burst . For NE ( Fig 9f ) , it continues to decay even after the initial burst , though at a slower pace .
6.2 Predicting the attributes of exited users
Privacy continues to erode even for retired users . We further analyze what happens to the privacy of users who left the system . After their retirement , no more useroriginating information ( “ online breadcrumbs ” ) is available to disclose private traits . We quantify the prediction performance on a user population who have edited prior to 01012008 , but stopped after this date . Therefore , any information introduced in the system by the users themselves is restricted to the timeframes before 2008 . In Fig 10a , we plot the AUC over time for the education/undergrads binary classifier . We observe an constant increase of prediction performance , even though it shows a saturation in later timeframes . An increase of prediction performance for for retired users is also observable for religion/christian ( see the SI [ 1] ) , but not for any of the other binary classifiers . No longer being in activity , the loss of privacy after 01.2008 is not the result of the users’ actions . A Temporal Information Theory analysis performed on this exited population shows Information Transfer values of zero after 01.2008 – ie no information originating with “ online breadcrumbs ” . As far as we know , these are the first results to show that certain private traits could be predicted increasingly better even after the users exited the system .
Why does privacy degrade for exited users ? Intuitively , user originating information is available only until the exit of the users , afterwards the source of new information are in the actions of other users . Predictions about unseen retired users can be made only using features relating to their period of activity ( here 01/2007 12/2007 ) . In the logistic regression models learned at each timeframe , the strength of the links between features and the class variable are given by the corresponding coefficients . We study the coefficients of features which encode the activity of users prior to their retirement ( ie X u 1:4 ) . We show the coefficients relating to CONTENT ( in Fig 10b ) and to USER ( in Fig 10c ) , in models learned for education/undergrads in each timeframe . In later timeframes , CONTENT features observe an increase in importance , with both CONTENT2 ( number of CONTENT revisions in the 2nd quarter of 2007 ) and CONTENT3 steadily increasing from being completely absent in the initial models . CONTENT4 remains absent for all timeframes . Simultaneously , USER features decrease in importance , with USER4 disappearing completely . We hypothesize that the AUC increase observed after 01.2008 originates with the currently active users whose activity overlapped with the exited users : classifier learns from users active both before and after 01.2008 , by modifying the weights of features , including those before 012008 In this case , they learn that CONTENT features should have more importance , while USER features should have less . In summary , predicting of personal traits increase even for retired users , and the key factor for this improvement is better estimates on a subset of important features such as CONTENT .
7 . DISCUSSION
We present a first study to quantify the extent of gradual privacy erosion over six years . First , we set up a large scale evaluation using Wikipedia editing behavior to predict private traits over time . We analyze a 13 year history of Wikipedia edits made by more than 117 thousand users . Our descriptive analysis showed that as Wikipedia evolves , editors of different personal traits shows distinct patterns in their volume of edits and topical preferences . Second , we provide experimental evidence that time has an adverse effect on privacy . We show that prediction performance on private traits , such as gender , education and religion , increases with longer Wikipedia editing history . Third , we show that prediction of private traits improves even for users who have stopped editing Wikipedia . We further quantify the effect of predictability , and found that the improved performance can be attributed to two factors : new editors of Wikipedia , and better estimate of feature relevance with the first having a larger effect . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first study to quantify the change of private traits over time , using Wikipedia , an open online dataset containing behavior breadcrumbs . This work shall raise awareness in the public on the privacy implications of online activity over long periods of time . The fact that the information of newcomers can be used to learn more about existing members has profound implications : users do not have complete control over the consequences of the information they release . Reflecting on this work , we would like to discuss a few of its limitations , practical implications and connections to other areas of research .
What does it really mean for Wikipedia users , should they be worried ? To the best of our knowledge , no studies have shown that the real identity of Wikipedia users can be revealed based on their editing activity . However , this may not the case for other social networks .
User disclosure bias . This work uses self disclosed personal traits on users’ public profile . It is well known that such a data source is prone to users’ disclosure biase . The set of users who voluntarily disclose private information might be biased towards users less concerned with their privacy , who in turn has a distinct behavioral pattern . Validating the effect of such a bias would require an alternative source of groundtruth and maybe even behavioral data , and is beyond the scope of this study .
What about other online platforms ? Although we predict predict private traits from Wikipedia , similar prediction results ( on a static snapshop ) was reported for other Being a collaborative platforms such as Facebook [ 12 ] . encyclopedia , Wikipedia records relatively small amount of information about its users . More detailed longitudinal analyses could be performed on platforms such as Facebook , and it is likely to also see an increasing trend for predicting personal traits .
A natural law of evolution of privacy loss . This study provides empirical analysis about privacy loss . A longer term open challenge is a physical model for privacy loss , ie , predict the de anonymization rate of a given anonymized dataset .

Effective conditions for preserving privacy ? There is a growing literature on characterizing which privacy guarantees can be obtained under a given information release protocol [ 25 ] . We hope our findings invite new empirical and theoretical investigation into the case in which data release is spatio temporal and heterogeneous across different entities . In light of this study , we advocate that new means should be found to tackle the issue of online privacy . We argue one feasible means to preserving privacy is to construct laws which would enable erasing the recorded activity in the online environment .
