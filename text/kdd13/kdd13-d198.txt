ABSTRACT The benefits of crowdsourcing are well recognized today for an increasingly broad range of problems . Meanwhile , the rapid development of social media makes it possible to seek the wisdom of a crowd of targeted users . However , it is not trivial to implement the crowdsourcing platform on social media , specifically to make social media users as workers , we need to address the following two challenges : 1 ) how to motivate users to participate in tasks , and 2 ) how to choose users for a task . In this paper , we present Wise Market as an effective framework for crowdsourcing on social media that motivates users to participate in a task with care and correctly aggregates their opinions on pairwise choice problems . The Wise Market consists of a set of investors each with an associated individual confidence in his/her prediction , and after the investment , only the ones whose choices are the same as the whole market are granted rewards . Therefore , a social media user has to give his/her ‘‘best’’ answer in order to get rewards , as a consequence , careless answers from sloppy users are discouraged .
Under the Wise Market framework , we define an optimization problem to minimize expected cost of paying out rewards while guaranteeing a minimum confidence level , called the Effective Market Problem ( EMP ) . We propose exact algorithms for calculating the market confidence and the expected cost with O(n log2 n ) time cost in a Wise Market with n investors . To deal with the enormous number of users on social media , we design a Central Limit Theorem based approximation algorithm to compute the market confidence with O(n ) time cost , as well as a bounded approximation algorithm to calculate the expected cost with O(n ) time cost . Finally , we have conducted extensive experiments to validate effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on real and synthetic data .

INTRODUCTION
The wisdom of crowds has long been known , but only with the development of online services has it becomes possible to enroll and manage the crowd ’s work effectively and handle payments efficiently . On traditional crowdsourcing platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk ( AMT ) , task holders post their tasks onto a public task pool and wait for workers to choose them . Once the tasks are completed , workers are paid via the crowdsourcing platform . These centralized crowdsourcing platforms contribute greatly to facilitate the power of crowds . However , there are certain natural drawbacks of this mechanism : 1 ) Payments are only weakly associated with the quality of the work from crowd workers , so some workers try to maximize income by giving answers fast , even to the extent of giving random answers ; 2 ) Task holders cannot actively choose the workers . Rather they have to accept anyone who shows up and meets the published criteria , thereby having very limited control on the quality of workers recruited , and hence on the quality of work produced ; And 3 ) The crowd tends to be from a restricted demographic class [ 10 ] , which may produce biased results when demographics matter .
Users of social media services can be a huge reservoir of workers for crowdsourcing : 1 ) Users of social media range over a much broader demographics , and of course , a larger population ; 2)Information in the users’ profile can be used to infer some of their interests and abilities ; 3 ) Task holders can actively enroll targeted workers using built in functions like ‘@’ ( in Tiwtter ) or private messages ( in Facebook ) . Therefore , there is an emerging notion of "managed crowdsourcing" [ 5 , 6 ] , where workers are actively chosen . In this paper , we present WiseMarket as an effective framework to support such managed crowdsourcing , for tasks are twooption decision making problems . To this end , we tackle two essential challenges : how to motivate users to participate in tasks , and how to choose users for tasks .
Markets are known to be an effective institution for aggregating beliefs of online users and yielding reliable answers . For example , in Racetrack Betting [ 8 ] investors are only allowed to choose from two options , and the promised rewards are only given to the investors whose investment meets the market opinion ( the majority of all investors ) . We use this idea as the basis for our framework . Online users are considered investors in this market , while the social media is treated as a collective knowledge base . Thus , a wise market includes a set of investors , each associated with a probability ( individual confidence ) that he or she will give the correct answer . The system maintains a pool of candidate users while evaluating the users’ confidence simultaneously . When a particu

After their choices , the answer preferred by a majority of the users will be output as the market opinion and the ones who make the same choice as the market are granted a reward . Note that the output is the majority of the market , not necessarily the same as the ground truth . The probability that the market opinion meets the ground truth is considered as the Market Confidence . The expected total reward payout is the Market Cost borne by the task owner . Then the problem of building an ‘‘effective’’ market is to find a set of investors from all possible users , whose Market Cost is minimum subject to its Market Confidence satisfying a given threshold . We show the problem with the following example .
EXAMPLE 1 . Consider a candidate set of investors ( social media users ) A(0.8 ) , B(0.6 ) , C(0.7 ) , D(0.8 ) , E(05 ) Each candidate investor has an individual confidence as in brackets , and the task owner has a market confidence threshold θ = 085 Our problem is to find a set of investors who have the minimum market cost subject to the market confidence threshold . First , we try the market , W M1 = {A(0.8 ) , C(0.7 ) , D(0.8)} , following the majority rule , W M1 works correctly only when at least two investors make the correct choice . Specifically , there are in total four out of eight cases that the market provides the correct answers as shown in Table 1 . In the first 4 cases , the number of correct investors are in a majority(ie no less than 2 ) . We obtain the probability that the entire market performs correctly(Market Confidence ) by summing up the probabilities of the first 4 cases , ie M C(W M1 ) = 0.448 + 0.112 + 0.192 + 0.1912 = 0864 expected value of cost E[Cost ] = 3 · . 2 · .
Turning to the cost , we need to pay three units for case 1 , and two units each for cases 2,3,4 . Note that even when the market does not give the correct answer as in the last 4 cases , payments still need to be made to the majority of the investors . We denote the investors in majority as a Winning Set , whose size determines the payment . The ( Prob . of Case 1 and 8 ) + If we instead selected W M2 = {B(0.6 ) , C(0.7 ) , D(0.8)} , it turns out that W M2 has a market confidence of 0.788 and an expected cost of 236 W M2 is more ‘‘cheaper’’ than W M1 . However , since the given threshold is θ = 0.85 , W M2 does not satisfy the confidence threshold . In such a case , W M1 is the answer .
( Prob . of Case 2 to 7 ) = 246
In this paper , to address the problem of building an effective wise market on social media , we have made the following contributions : • We propose Wise Market , a new framework to manage the wisdom of online social users . • We define the Effective Market Problem as the central design • We design efficient exact algorithms to calculate the market confidence and the expected cost , as well as a Central Limit Theorem based approximation algorithm for the market confidence and an approximation algorithm for the expected cost with an approximation ratio of ( 3 − 2θ ) . challenge for effective utilization of wise markets .
• We provide an efficient algorithm to solve the Effective Market Problem , which seamlessly incorporates the proposed algorithms and two effective pruning methods .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . A formal definition of the problem is presented in Section 2 . In Section 3 , we study the calculation of Market Confidence and present both exact and approximate algorithms and in Section 4 , we study the structure of calculating Market Cost and propose both exact and approximation algorithms . Then , in Section 5 , we build upon the work in the preceding two sections to present the overall Effective Market Algorithm(EMA ) . In Section 6 , we empirically study the intrinsic characteristics of the problem and the performance of the proposed algorithms . Finally , in Section 7 , we summarize the most recent related work , and conclude in Section 8 .
2 . PROBLEM DEFINITION 2.1 Investor
In a Wise Market , each investor works on tasks , each of which is to make a choice between two given options . The task may have a ( latent ) ground truth , but this is not known to us . ( Some tasks may have a ground truth that is difficult to characterize eg which of two logos is more "eye catching" . ) When the option selected is the same as the aggregate market choice ( not necessarily the latent ground truth ) , the investor receives a reward of one unit . Investors make decisions based on their experience and general knowledge , and there is a chance that an investor fails to identify the true value of the target . So for an investor ιi , we define the individual confidence ci to describe how likely an investor is to choose correctly , and we use another variable vi ∈ {0 , 1} to denote its actual vote between the two choices .
DEFINITION 1
( INVESTOR CONFIDENCE ) . For each investor ιi , the Investor Confidence ci is the probability that ιi chooses the same option as the ground truth . ci = Pr{ιichooses correctly}
= Pr{G = 0} · Pr{vi = 0|G = 0}
+ Pr{G = 1} · Pr{vi = 1|G = 1}
= Pr{vi = G|G} where G is the ground truth , the confidence ci is a probability of making the correct choice , and there are two standard ways to evaluate it . First , confidence could be estimated from the frequency of correct judgments , which could be implemented by analyzing previous records or inserting tasks with known answers [ 12 ] . Second , since the probability reflects the subjective degree of the belief , the confidence ci can also be estimated by associating the relative authoritativeness of users [ 6 ] . 2.2 Wise Market
A Wise Market is a set of investors along with rules to aggregate the market information and issue rewards to successful investors . Assume I = {ι1 , ι2 , . . . , ιN} is the set of all investors , we define a Wise Market as follows : ( Wise Market ) . A Wise Market is a set of investors W Mn = {ι1 , ι2 , . . . , ιn} ⊆ I with size n , where each ιi is associated with an individual confidence ci and actual vote vi .
DEFINITION 2
The most popular aggregation rule is Majority Voting , which presents the opinions of the majority of investors as output . We denote such output as the Market Opinion and present the formal definition as follows :
DEFINITION 3
( MARKET OPINION ) . Given a Wise Market W M , the Market Opinion OP ( W Mn ) is the aggregated result
456 according to the following equation : fi
OP ( W Mn ) =
1 0

To avoid the cumbersome special case where the vote is tied , in this paper we study the case where the size of a Wise Market is ODD . 221 Market Confidence
As an institution for aggregating the distributed knowledge , the quality of a Wise Market is measured according to the probability that the market successfully identifies the true value of a task . For better illustration , we first define the concept of Truth Set C = {ιi|ιi ∈ W Mn st vi = G} , which includes the investors whose answers are identical to the ground truth G .
DEFINITION 4
( MARKET CONFIDENCE ) . The Market Confidence M C is defined as the probability that the Market Opinion is the same as the ground truth G :

222 Market Cost
Another significant concept for a Wise Market is the Market Cost . We assume that unit rewards are granted to the winning investors . In such a setting , the market cost is numerically equal to the number of winning investors in a market , in other words , the size of the majority in a market .
We define the concept of Winning Set as the set of investors who have the same opinion as the market opinion . We then formally define the Market Cost as follows :
DEFINITION 5 the Market Cost , Cost(W Mn ) , is the size of the Winning Set :

Note that , only when OP ( W Mn ) = G , the two sets W and C
The Market Cost varies according to different constitution of Wise Market , and to measure the effectiveness of a Wise Market , we present the concept of Expected Market Cost , which follows the definition of expected value : E[Cost(W Mn ) ] nff nff

2.3 Effective Market Problem
Formally , we define the Effective Market Problem as follows :

''C
'' , we threshold θ , the Effective Market Problem(EMP ) is to find a subset of all investors W Mn ⊆ I , so that : minimize E[Cost(W Mn ) ] subject to M C(W Mn ) ≥ θ
3 . CALCULATION OF MARKET CONF
There are three main subproblems to be studied to build up an effective Wise Market from a given set of investors , the first one is to efficiently calculate the Market Confidence , the second one is to calculate the Market Cost , and the third one is to efficiently pinpoint the most effective subset of all investors as a market . We study each of these sub problems in turn in the following three subsections . 3.1 A Divide and Conquer based Exact Method the probability that the size of C is no less than ff n the size of C ( Therefore , the probability mass function of lows ,

In order to compute the Market Confidence efficiently , we propose a divide and conquer based exact algorithm ( Algorithm DC in Figure 1 ) . The algorithm first divides the set of investors W Mn into two groups , W Mn1 and W Mn2 , as long as W Mn does not have a single member in lines 1 2 . Then , the algorithm recursively computes the probability mass function of tioned groups in lines 3 4 . As a consequence , we get two vectors of size n in W Mn1 and W Mn2 , respectively . In fact , the probability of each possible value of global of corresponding probabilities in two partitioned groups . According to the concept of convolution , the corresponding probabilities of each value of

Moreover , '' and compute M C(W Mn ) of where V eclower and V ecupper are used to store the probability distribution of in order to speedup the recursive computation of convolution , we employ the Fast Fourier Transform ( FFT ) and the Inverse Fast Fourier Transform(iFFT ) in line 5 . In addition , the algorithm exits in lines 8 10 . Thus , based on Algorithm DC , we can obtain the probability distribution of the given set of investors W Mn easily . Algorithm MCA(Figure 2 ) shows the details of computing market confidence of W Mn . Back to the running example , we illustrate Algorithm DC in Figure 3 : We first split the set of {A , C , D} into two smaller sets {A} and {C , D} , and recursively split {C , D} into {C} and {D} . Then we merge the smaller sets using convolution , and FFT and iFFT are adopted to speedup the process . Computational Complexity Analysis : In line 5 of Algorithm DC , the computation cost of the FFT based convolution is O(n log n ) , where n is the size of W Mn . Thus , the whole complexity of Algorithm DC is O(n log2 n ) . Consequently , the exact market confidence can be computed by Algorithm MCA with computational complexity of O(n log2 n ) .

3.2 A Chernoff Inequality based Bounding
According to Definition 6 , we only need to test whether the market confidence of W Mn is larger than the given threshold and need not to get the exact value of M C(W Mn ) . Thus , we are interested only in an efficient checking method . In this part , we include a tight upper bound of M C(W Mn ) to help speed up the checking .
LEMMA 1 . ( Chernoff Inequality based Bounding ) Given a Wise Market W Mn , a market confidence threshold θ , M C(W Mn ) satisfies the following upper bound ,

Note that due to the limit of the space , proofs of all the lemmas Based on Lemma 1 , we only spend O(n ) time to check whether the upper bound satisfies the confidence threshold . 3.3 A Central Limit Theorem based Approx imation Algorithm
As we discussed above , the Chernoff Inequality based bounding technique of M C(W Mn ) can improve the efficiency of the exact solution by employing the upper bound to check whether the set can be pruned . Then , we perform Algorithm MCA if the set fails to be filtered . However , in a real social network , which features a large number of candidate users , the computational cost is still high , especially when the set of investors fail to satisfy the market confidence threshold and cannot be filtered by the above pruning method . In this subsection , we propose an efficient Central LimitTheorem based approximation algorithm which not only has linear computational complexity but also returns the result with a high confidence . The basic idea is to use the probability density function of a Standard Normal distribution to replace the probability mass function of M C(W Mn ) can be approximately computed by the probability density function of a Standard Normal distribution . In the following , we firstly prove that the probability distribution of verges in probability to a Standard Normal distribution , and then propose our approximation algorithm .

PROOF . For each investor associated with individual confidence ci , we denote ζi as the random event that ιi invests correctly , which follows the Binomial distribution . Thus , the expectation and variance of ζi are E(ζi ) = ci and V ar(ζi ) = ci(1 − ci ) , respectively . For a given Wise Market W Mn , i=1 ζi , so the expectation and variance of

Because different ιi may have different ci , ζ1ζn are independent and may not follow a same distribution . Based on the Lyapunov ’s Central Limit Theorem , the probability distribution of converges in probability to a Standard Normal distribution iff the following two conditions hold : 1.E[|ζi| ]

For the first condition , it is obviously correct because E(ζi ) and V ar(ζi ) are finite . And the second condition is also satisfied based on the existence of a suitable δ . A detailed proof can be found in our technical report [ 7 ] .
Based on Theorem 1 , we design an approximate algorithm(see
Algorithm CLT MC in Figure 4 ) to compute M C(W Mn ) efficiently . In Algorithm CLT MC , the expectation and the variance σ of

''C the M C(W Mn ) can be obtained by a hash function which maps different expectations and variances to the corresponding probabilities under a Standard Normal distribution . Back to the running example , while = E(|C| ) = 0.8 + 0.8 + √ 0.7 = 2.3 and δ = 0.16 + 0.16 + 0.21 = 0.728 , according to Theorem 1 , φ( 2+05−23 ) = 061 Note that as the data size increases , the approximated value gets closer to the real value .

Computational Complexity Analysis : In Algorithm CLT MC , the computational complexity is only O(n ) where n is the size of Wise Market W Mn because we only accumulate the expectation and the variance of since we implement the probability calculation of the Standard Normal distribution via a hashing function , line 5 only requires O(1)time .

In this subsection , we focus on how to compute the market cost exactly .

Then , according to Definition 5 , ability distribution of the expected market cost is computed in lines 2 6 and the final market cost is returned in line 7 . Computational Complexity Analysis : Because Algorithm EEC employs Algorithm DC in line 1 , this step spends O(n log2 n ) comIn lines putational cost where n is the size of the Wise Market . 2 6 , the algorithm spends O(n ) time cost . Thus , the total computational complexity of Algorithm EEC is O(n log2 n ) + O(n ) = O(n log2 n ) . 4.2 An Approximation Algorithm
''C
In order to compute the market cost efficiently , we also introduce an approximation algorithm which has linear computational complexity and a constant approximation ratio . Before we discuss the approximation algorithm , we introduce a pair of lower and upper bounds of the expected market cost via the following two lemmas .
LEMMA 2 . ( Lower Bound of Expected Market Cost ) Given a
Wise Market W Mn , the following inequality holds : nff ci < E[Cost(W Mn ) ] i=1 where each ci is the invest confidence of each ιi .
In addition to the lower bound of the expected market cost in Lemma 2 , we also find the upper bound of the expected market cost in the following lemma .
LEMMA 3 . ( Upper Bound of Expected Market Cost ) Given a Wise Market W Mn , and a market confidence threshold θ , the following inequality holds : nff ci + n(1 − θ )
E[Cost(W Mn ) ] < i=1
Based on the aforementioned upper bound of the expected market cost , we can use the upper bound instead of the expected market cost as the approximation result and guarantee that the approximation result is at most ( 3 − 2θ ) times larger than the exact result in the following theorem .
THEOREM 2 . ( Approximation Ratio of Approximate Expected Market Cost ) Given a Wise Market W Mn , a market confidence threshold θ , the upper bound in Lemma 3 is at most 3 − 2θ times larger than the exact expected market cost .

Based on Theorem 2 , we can design an approximation algorithm
'' which has ( 3−2θ)−approximation ratio in Algorithm AEC(Figure 6 ) .
In Algorithm AEC , we firstly compute , the expectation of in lines 1 2 . Then , we return an approximation result in line 3 .

Back to the running example , according to the results in Section 3(Figure 3 ) , we can obtain the exact cost E[Cost(W M1 ) ] = 0012·3+0124·2+0416·2+0448·3 = 246 While using Algorithm 6 , we could obtain an approximate value of E[Cost(W M1 ) ] = 2.3 + 3· ( 1 − 0.85 ) = 2.75 , where the threshold θ = 0.85 and the algorithm achieves an approximation ratio equal to 11
Computational Complexity Analysis : Because Algorithm AEC only needs to compute the expectation
'' , the total computational complexity of Algorithm AEC is of O(n ) . 5 . BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE MARKET
''C
In this section , we discuss the strategy to solve the effective market problem by integrating both algorithms of computing the market confidence and the expected market cost . According to the definition of the expected market cost , there is not any monotonicity or anti monotonicity between the subset/superset relationship . So we have to enumerate all possible subsets of the N investors and then check their market confidences and the expected market costs via our solutions discussed above . Therefore , an effective and efficient heuristic algorithm for the effective market problem is shown by the following filtering and verification framework .
459 Algorithm AEC {
Input : A set of investors W Mn Output : The expected Market Cost E[Cost(W Mn ) ] ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) for i ← 1 to n ← + ci ; return E[Cost(W Mn ) ] ← + n(1 − θ ) ;
}
Figure 6 : Approximation Expected Market Cost Algorithm ( AEC )
First Step : We first check whether there exists at least one investor whose market confidence is no less than the market confidence threshold θ . If so , the effective market only includes the investor who has the smallest but threshold satisfying confidence among all the given investors , and then the algorithm stops . Actually , it is equal for any eligible investor to be selected when the size of the effective market is one . However , for the case that the size of the effective market is more than one , an effective heuristic rule is that invertors with the smallest confidence are tried firstly because the unqualified markets can be safely pruned in O(n ) time complexity ( Lemma 1 and Algorithm DC ) . On the contrary , we have to spend O(nlog2n ) time complexity to test the unqualified markets . Therefore , we still select the investor with the smallest confidence when the size of market is one to keep the consistent strategy style . Second Step : If there is no single investor as the effective market , we will enumerate all possible subsets . The main heuristic rule is to search from the smallest market to the larger ones , and test from the combination of investors with smallest confidence to that with higher confidence . Thus , if the Chernoff inequality based upper bound of a subset is smaller than θ , this subset can be filtered.(Filtering Phase )
Third Step : For the subsets of all investors that cannot be pruned , we compute their expected market costs and find the minimum one . ( Verification Phase )
Note that in the first step , we select the investors with the smallest confidence for quickly finding the eligible crowd with the minimum number of investors . Based on the framework above , in the worst case , this solution is O(2N ) where N is the size of all the given investors . For a large amount of data , it is expensive to use this exact method to find the effective market . Therefore , according to the approximation algorithm of the expected market cost in Algorithm AEC , we propose an efficient approximation algorithm to discover the effective market in Algorithm EMA(Figure 7 ) . The basic idea is to search for an effective market in the increasing order of size . For the subsets of same size , we can rank them by their approximation expected Market Cost ( Algorithm AEC ) in an ascending order . Once we find a subset whose market confidence is greater than θ , we stop and return this subset as the final effective market . More details can be found in Algorithm EMA . Before discussion of Algorithm EMA , we propose a pruning method called Early Termination to speed up the algorithm . LEMMA 4 . ( Early Termination ) Given a set of investors I = {ι1 , ι2 , . . . , ιN} , a subset M ⊆ I which has the current minimum market cost(CM C ) so far , a market confidence threshold θ , the algorithm of EMP can stop if and only if CM C ≤ M C(M min ) min contains |M| + 2 investors with the smallest individwhere M ual confidence ci .
In Algorithm EMA , we firstly check whether the largest probability among N investors is larger than the confidence threshold θ . If so , we can directly return the investor who has the minimum probability among investors whose probabilities are not less than θ in line 1 . Otherwise , we continue to check other subsets of the N investors in lines 3 12 . We first perform the Early Termination pruning of Lemma 4 in lines 5 6 . Then , for the set of all subsets whose size is i , Si , we use the function RankM erge(Si ) to generate all ( i+2) size subsets by merging any two i size subsets and to
Algorithm EMA { if ( Max(ci ) ≥ θ ) return EM ← c ∈ W Mn st minimized{E[Cost(c)]} and MC(c ) ≥ θ ; for i ← 1 to n − 1
Input : A set of candidate investors I = {ι1 , . . . , ιN} , a market confidence threshold θ Output : the effective market EM ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) else ( 4 ) ( 5 ) ( 6 ) ( 7 ) ( 8 ) ( 9 ) ( 10 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 )

}
Figure 7 : Effective Market Algorithm ( EMA ) rank them according to the combinatorial order of their ranked confidences in line 7 , eg < c1 , c2 , c5 > ranks before < c1 , c3 , c4 > . If there exists at least one subset whose market confidence is no less than θ , we find the subsets which have the smallest expected market cost among all ( i+2) size subsets whose market confidences are no less than θ ( lines 8 10 ) . In addition , in lines 11 12 , we directly terminate the process to check any ( i+2) size subset if all i size subsets fail to satisfy the confidence threshold θ . 6 . EVALUATION
In this section , we present a series of empirical studies of the performance of our proposed algorithms . All experiments are conducted on a PC with 2 Intel(R ) Core(TM ) 2.13GHz CPU and 2GB memory , running on Microsoft 64 bit Windows 7 .
Since WiseMarket is designed as an advanced tool for the enterprise level task holders , our empirical studies are conducted for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the tool .
Synthetic datasets are generated to explore the intrinsic characteristics of the problems and algorithms ; and real datasets are adopted to evaluate the usability of the algorithms . Therefore , we estimate the confidence from both ranking based method [ 8 ] and benchmark based method [ 15 ] on a collection of Weibo1 data with 1,200 users , which could serve as a real distribution of the confidence among social online users . The Weibo service is a rapid growing platform in Chinese web community , and we choose it as a representative example for online user distribution . In addition , synthetic data sets include both normal distribution and Zipf distribution . The Zipf distribution is pervasively observed in Internetrelated phenomenon , and become one of the most verified laws in the networks associated with human behaviors[1 ] . The basic fact of Zipf distribution is that in social networks , there is a log linear relationship between the size and the rank of certain groups of individuals . The distribution is described by a skew factor s , indicating how quickly the size decreases according to its rank .
To better study the inherent computational characteristics of the EM P , we conduct an empirical study to test the intrinsic traits of M C and Cost , and the performance of our algorithms for calculation of M C , Cost , and EM P . 6.1 Intrinsic Traits of M C and Cost
The characteristics of the Market Confidence and Market Cost over different datasets are our major interest . We generate a set of datasets following normal distribution , with varying mean value from 0.1 to 0.9 and variance from 0.1 to 0.3 respectively . Each dataset includes 1,000 candidate investors .
The results are shown in Figure 8(a ) and Figure 8(b ) . We see that when the given mean approaches 0.5 , the M C increases rapidly to 1 . This indicates that a reliable Wise Market may be established from a relatively small group of investors . Note that when the variance is small(eg var = 0.1 ) , the convergence is much more 1wwwweibocom , the largest microblog service in China

Figure 8 : Experiments Results I(N for Normal Dist . , Z for Zipf Dist . ) obvious since it is a closer approximation to Binomial Distribution . Another interesting phenomenon is in Figure 8(b ) , where the market with lowest Market Cost is achieved by the investors with mean of 05 In such Wise Market , the probability density distribution of the size of Winning Set in a Wise Market is close to ff n . Conceptually , either too many wise investors or too many careless investors will cause a large size of W inningSet , which incurs higher Cost and renders the Wise Market ‘‘ineffective’’ .
2
To further observe the characteristics of M C according to the change of the size of the given Wise Market , we run the algorithm on datasets with varying size from 10 to 90 , where datasets from Normal distribution have mean from 0.3 to 0.7 and variance of 0.2 , and of Zipf distribution have skew factor s from 0.3 to 07 The results are shown from Figure 8(c ) to Figure 8(d ) . In Figure 8(c ) , it is shown that the M C is very sensitive to the given mean value of the Wise Market . For the Wise Market whose mean value is above 0.5 , the M C grows very sharply to 1 with increasing of the market size . Note that for Zipf Distribution , the M C decreases quickly to almost zero . It is because in the datasets of Zipf distribution , most of the investors have low confidence .
6.2 Performance of Algorithms for Calculat ing M C and Cost
Based on the intrinsic traits of M C and Cost , in this subsection we evaluate the performance , including efficiency and effectiveness , of our proposed algorithms .
Efficiency We compare the efficiency among all proposed algorithms for calculating M C and Cost . The datasets have varying size from 100 to 800 . In addition , for Normal distribution , the mean is set as 0.7 and the variance is set as 0.2 ; for Zipf distribution , the parameter s is set as 07
We conduct Algorithm DC and Algorithm MCA to calculate exact M C value(denoted as exact ) , and we also conduct Algorithm based on Lemma 1 and Algorithm CLT MC to fetch the upper bound ( denoted as chnf ) and the approximated values ( denoted as clt ) . All results are shown from Figure 8(e ) to 8(h ) . The results show great efficiency speedup by utilizing the upper bounding technique and Central Limit Theorem based approximation algorithm . It can be observed that the time cost of exact algorithms exhibits an O(n · log2 n ) increasing tendency .
Effectiveness The datasets are generated following a normal distribution with mean 0.6 and variance 02 For the Zipf distribution , the generated datasets have skew factor s 02 All datasets are studied with number of nodes varying from 10 to 90 . The results are shown from Figure 8(i ) to Figure 9(b ) . The result in Figure 8(i ) shows the close approximation between the exact value(‘‘exact’’ ) of M C and the one derived via CLT ( ‘‘clt’’ ) . Due to space limitations , we present the most representative results of performance of the effectiveness issue on Weibo data from Figure 9(e ) to Figure 9(h ) .
In Figure 8(j ) and Figure 8(l ) , we observe the approximation ratio of the Cost both in Normal and Zipf Distribution datasets . Instead of a converging asymptotically , the approximation of Market Cost exhibits a linear tendency(ie3 − 2θ ) . Further , we vary the given threshold θ from 0.6 to 0.95 , and the results of Cost and its approximation are shown in Figure 9(a ) and Figure9(b ) , where the higher the threshold , the closer the approximation is . Note that in Figure 9(b ) , the approximated cost becomes lower than the exact value(dashed line denoted as appx 2 ) when the given threshold is greater than 08 That is because the approximation only holds when the confidence of the given Wise Market satisfies the threshold(see Theorem 2 ) . So , in Algorithm EMA , the approximation of Cost is only considered after its M C is validated .
6.3 Performance of Algorithm for EM P
The EM P problem is essentially with an O(2N ) search space , so the proposed algorithm is actually an approximation algorithm .

With varying size from 100 to 800 and varying threshold θ with 0.8 and 0.9 , we present the Market Confidence and Cost of the selected Effective Market . Results are shown in Figure 9(c ) and Figure 9(d ) . It is interesting to observe that given a threshold , our algorithm could return a Wise Market with a proper M C . While the size of the given candidates set increases , the M C and Cost of selected Wise Market do not increase obviously . However , the increased threshold θ will cause a rise in Cost in order to include more investors with higher individual confidence . Moreover , the dotted line represents the performance with a baseline greedy algorithm , which enrolls workers according to their confidence until the threshold is satisfied . The result shows that for the same candidate crowd , the market from our algorithm requests less market cost , which verifies our motivation for a Wise market .
From Figure 9(e ) to Figure 9(h ) , we show the performance of EM P on real datasets . The results correspond to the complexity analysis in Section 5 , where the approximation of MC and Cost behave satisfactory with increasing size . The difference of performance originates from different confidence estimation methods . 7 . RELATED WORK AND DISCUSSION
Crowdsourcing is the human computation [ 19 ] and social computing [ 11 ] powered with crowdsourced workforce . In the context of data management , crowdsourcing is primarily used in one of two ways : 1 . As a new computing power , the crowds serve as ‘‘HPU’’ that broadens the spectrum of processable data ; 2 . it introduces the entire social media/network as the data source instead of traditional formatted datasets . There are several leading prototype databases powered with crowdsourcing , eg sCoop [ 18 ] , CrowdDB [ 9 ] and Qurk [ 14 ] , as well as several specific operations based on these prototypes , egRanking [ 23 ] , Join [ 13 ] , Entity Matching [ 24 ] , etc . Most of these systems and applications rely on a crowdsourcing platform like AMT as the workforce market . In addition , there are efforts to capture the wisdom of crowds from social media users , most notably in the context of opinions and reviews of popular products and travel ( hotels and restaurants ) . Beyond these , social sensor networks are proposed to monitor earthquakes [ 21 ] and epidemics [ 2 ] . Particularly , a visionary work [ 6 ] studies decision making tasks on micro blog service with an idealized payment model . Another related concept is the Prediction Market , which is believed to be initially inspired by the financial markets’ capability of processing miscellaneous information . In the setting of such a market , even though investors intrinsically choose the option to maximize their rewards , the choice still reflects the investor ’s real opinion between the two options ( proven in [ 8] ) . As prototypes but also successfully running business , Iowa Electronic Market [ 3 ] and Intrade [ 4 ] are early examples of real world prediction markets . Please also refer to [ 26 ] for a comprehensive survey of applications and models of the prediction market .
The quality of the answers from crowds is always a major concern for researchers in this area , and conducting ‘‘workers’’ selection in an active manner is one of the best practices . Related works include Active Surveying [ 22 , 25 ] which studies the optimal approach to issue social inquiries . Survey sampling is a welldeveloped science [ 20 ] . The primary concern is to get representative samples from different demographic segments of the population , with an assumption of differences in opinion across segments . In our case , we are less interested in demographic differences rather we are operating in a universe with a well understood ground truth , which we just happen not to know and hence crowdsource to learn . Moreover , online review aggregation [ 17 , 16 ] has been extensively studied in the social media scenario these works typically aggregate all the inputs without any confidence or quality guarantee . Furthermore , the user contribution is driven by their own intrinsic motivation , and hence hard to control .
Discussion Note that the crowd ‘‘workers’’ here are normal social network/media users , who spend time on the service for pleasure and entertainment . Therefore , dissimilar to the commercial crowdsourcing platform like AMT , the existence of a potential payment is already an effective arousal ; besides , all the work of the users is simply making a binary choice to maximize their benefits , which also amazingly reflects their own judgement about the task ( proven in [ 8] ) . As a comparison , the worker model in multi agent systems ( MAS ) is designed to be more sophisticated with diverse functional attributes , which facilitates the study of logic and effectiveness of mutual cooperation . In summary , model wise , our work provides task holders an advanced ‘‘crowd finder’’ while MAS focuses more on the worker side ; and problem wise , our work tackles a special subset problem challenge , while the MAS aims at more sophisticated optimization problems .
The limitation of this work is that we only focus on binary voting tasks , but it will not be substantially difficult to extend the setting to multiple choice problems . Moreover , this work is serving as a visionary effort in the research line of actively exploiting the power from online social users . Exciting future work includes more powerful and sophisticated tasks , where the quality of the crowds is measured differently according to the specific tasks .
462 8 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we define a new architecture for crowdsourcing using prediction markets defined over social media services . We define the Effective Market Problem(EMP ) as a means for task owners to get crowdsourced answers with the smallest expected cost while meeting a specified confidence threshold . To calculate the market confidence , we present an exact algorithm with O(n log2 n ) time and a Central Limit Theorem based approximation algorithm with O(n ) time . To calculate the expected market cost , an exact algorithm with O(n log2 n ) time complexity is provided , and an approximation algorithm , which has the O(n ) time complexity and the ( 3− 2θ ) approximation ratio , is provided . An efficient algorithm for EMP by integrating the proposed algorithms . We have verified our proposed algorithms through extensive empirical studies .
We believe that this is only the first paper to exploit this new architecture , restricted to binary questions with a simple majority vote as the aggregation method . We hope , in the future work , to be able to further expand the class of questions that can be addressed fruitfully with this architecture .

10 . APPENDIX 10.1 Correctness of Lyapunov ’s Central Limit
Theorem
For a given set of investors W Mn , events ζ1ζn are independent and may not follow a same distribution . The correctness of Lyapunov ’s CLT is based on the guarantee of the following two constraint conditions .
1.E[|ζi|]2+δ is finite where δ > 0(i = 1 , , n ) 2 .
1
E[|ζi − E(ζi)|]2+δ = 0 if there is δ > 0 lim n→∞
V ar2+δ(|C| )
The first condition has been proven in Theorem 1 , we only discuss the correctness of the second condition here .
Firstly , for δ = 2 , we verify whether the second condition holds :
E[|ζi − E(ζi)|]2+2 = ci(1 − ci)4 + ( 1 − ci)c4 = ci(1 − ci)(c3 i + ( 1 − ci)3 ) ( i = 1 , , n ) n . i
In addition , we can also obtain
V ar(|C|)2+2 = V ar4(|C| ) = ( V ar(|C|)2)2 = ( ci(1 − ci))2 i=1
According to the two formulas above , we have the following inequality . n .
0 ≤
1
E[|ζi − E(ζi)|]4 i + ( 1 − ci)3 ) i=1
V ar4(|C| ) fin i=1 ci(1 − ci)(c3 fin i=1 ci(1 − ci))2 fin fin i=1(1 + 1 ) i=1

So ,
2 n 2
= 0 lim n→∞ n . i=1
Based on the Squeeze Theorem , we can obtain
1 lim n→∞
V ar4(|lC| )
E[|ζi − E(ζi)|]4 = 0
Thus , the second condition holds . Namely , for random variables {ζ1ζn} , the normal sum of {ζ1ζn} is 1' V ar(|C| )
Zn =
( n .
ζi − n . i=1 i=1 ci )
So , for any x ∈ ( −∞ , +∞ ) , the cumulative distribution function , Fn(x ) , of Zn has lim n→∞ Fn(x ) = lim n→∞ P r{Zn ≤ x} =
Thus , we can know that the probability distribution of 2 probability to Standard Normal distribution . ff x −∞
