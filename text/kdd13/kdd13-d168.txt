ABSTRACT Opinionated social media such as product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for their decision making . However , due to the reason of profit or fame , people try to game the system by opinion spamming ( eg , writing fake reviews ) to promote or to demote some target products . In recent years , fake review detection has attracted significant attention from both the business and research communities . However , due to the difficulty of human labeling needed for supervised learning and evaluation , the problem remains to be highly challenging . This work proposes a novel angle to the problem by modeling spamicity as latent . An unsupervised model , called Author Spamicity Model ( ASM ) , is proposed . It works in the Bayesian setting , which facilitates modeling spamicity of authors as latent and allows us to exploit various observed behavioral footprints of reviewers . The intuition is that opinion spammers have different behavioral distributions than non spammers . This creates a distributional divergence between the latent population distributions of two clusters : spammers and non spammers . Model inference results in learning the population distributions of the two clusters . Several extensions of ASM are also considered leveraging from different priors . Experiments on a real life Amazon review dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models which significantly outperform the state of the art competitors .

1 . INTRODUCTION Online reviews of products and services are used extensively by consumers and businesses to make critical purchase , product design , and customer service decisions . However , due to the financial incentives associated with positive reviews , imposters try to game the system by posting fake reviews and giving unfair ratings to promote or demote target products and services . Such individuals are called opinion spammers and their activities are called opinion spamming [ 14 ] . The problem of opinion spam is widespread , and many high profile cases have been reported in the news [ 40 ] . In fact the menace has become so serious that Yelp.com has launched a “ sting ” operation to publicly shame businesses who buy fake reviews [ 39 ] .
In recent years , researchers have also studied the problem and proposed several techniques . However , the problem is still wide open . Unlike many other forms of spamming , the key difficulty for solving the opinion spam problem is that it is hard to find gold standard data of fake and non fake reviews for model building because it is very difficult , if not impossible , to manually recognize/label fake/non fake reviews by mere reading [ 14 , 34 ] .
Since it was first studied in [ 14 ] , various methods have been proposed to detect opinion spam . One of the main methods is supervised learning [ 10 , 14 , 34 ] . However , due to the lack of reliable ground truth label of fake/non fake review data , existing works have relied mostly on ad hoc or pseudo fake/non fake labels for model building . In [ 14 ] , duplicate and near duplicate reviews were assumed to be fake reviews , which is restrictive and can be unreliable . In [ 25 ] , a manually labeled dataset was used , which also has reliability issues because it has been shown that the accuracy of human labeling of fake reviews is very poor [ 34 ] . In [ 34 ] , Amazon Mechanical Turk ( AMT ) was employed to crowdsource fake hotel reviews by paying ( US$1 per review ) anonymous online workers ( called Turkers ) to write fake reviews for some hotels . Although these reviews are fake , they do not reflect the dynamics of fake reviews in a commercial website [ 31 ] as the Turkers do not have the same psychological state of mind when they write fake reviews as that of fake reviewers in a commercial website who have real business interests to promote or to demote . Also , Turkers may not have sufficient domain knowledge or experience to write convincing fake reviews . Due to the lack of labeled data , unsupervised methods have also been proposed for detecting individual [ 26 , 42 ] and group [ 29 , 30 ] spammers , time series [ 46 ] and distributional [ 9 ] analysis , and mining reviewing patterns as unexpected association rules [ 15 ] and reviewing burstiness [ 8 ] .
In a wide field , a study of bias and controversy of research paper reviews was reported in [ 24 ] . However , research paper reviews do not usually involve faking . Web spam [ 3 , 38 , 45 ] , email spam [ 5 ] , blog spam [ 22 ] , clickbots [ 19 ] , auction fraud [ 35 ] , social networks [ 13 ] , etc . have also been widely investigated . However , the dynamics of these forms of spamming are quite different from those of opinion spamming in reviews .
The above existing works in opinion spam have made good progresses . However , they are largely based on heuristics and/or hinge on ad hoc fake/non fake labels for model building . No principled or theoretical models have been proposed so far .
This paper proposes a novel and principled technique to model and to detect opinion spamming in a Bayesian framework . It transcends the existing limitations discussed above and presents an unsupervised method for detecting opinion spam . We take a fully Bayesian approach and formulate opinion spam detection as a clustering problem . The Bayesian setting allows us to model spamicity of reviewers as latent with other observed behavioral features in our Author Spamicity Model ( ASM ) . Spamicity here means the degree of being spamming . The key motivation hinges on the hypothesis that opinion spammers differ from others on behavioral dimensions [ 29 ] . This creates a separation margin between population distributions of two naturally occurring clusters : spammers and non spammers . Inference in ASM results in learning the distributions of two clusters ( or classes ) based on a set of behavioral features . Various extensions of ASM are also proposed exploiting different priors .
In summary , this paper makes the following contributions :
1 . It proposes a novel and principled method to exploit observed behavioral footprints to detect spammers ( fake reviewers ) in an unsupervised Bayesian framework precluding the need of any manual labels for learning which is both hard [ 14 ] and noisy [ 34 ] . A key advantage of employing Bayesian inference is that the model facilities characterization of various spamming activities using estimated latent variables and the posterior . It facilitates both detection and analysis in a single framework rendering a deep insight into the opinion spam problem . This cannot be done using existing methods . To our knowledge , this is the first principled model for solving this problem .
2 . It proposes a novel technique to evaluate the results without using any labeled data . This method uses reviews of the top ranked and bottom ranked authors produced by the model as two classes of data to build a supervised classifier . The key idea is that the classification uses a complete different set of features than those used in modeling . Thus , if this classifier can classify accurately , it gives a good confidence that the unsupervised spamicity model is effective ( details in §33 )
3 . It conducts a comprehensive set of experiments to evaluate the proposed model based on the classification evaluation method above and also human expert judgment . It also compares with a set of strong baseline techniques . The results show that the proposed models outperform the baselines significantly .
2 . MODEL This section details the proposed unsupervised model . We first discuss the basic intuition ( §2.1 ) and the observed features ( §22 ) In §2.3 , we explain the generative process of our model and detail inference methods in §2.4 and §25 2.1 Model Overview As discussed above , the proposed model formulates spam detection as an unsupervised clustering problem in the Bayesian setting . It belongs to the class of generative models for clustering
[ 6 ] based on a set of observed features . It models spamicity , 𝑠𝑎 ( degree/tendency of spamming in the range [ 0 , 1 ] ) of an author , 𝑎 ; and spam/non spam label , 𝜋𝑟 of a review , 𝑟 as latent variables . 𝜋𝑟 ( we have two clusters , 𝐾 = 2 , spam and non spam ) for every review instance . Each author/reviewer ( and respectively each review ) has a set of observed features ( behavioral clues ) emitted according to the corresponding latent prior class distributions . Model inference learns the latent population distributions of the two clusters across various behavioral dimensions , and also the cluster assignments of reviews in the unsupervised setting based on the principle of probabilistic model based clustering [ 37 ] . is essentially the class variable reflecting the cluster memberships
As the generative process of ASM conditions review spam labels on author spamicites , inference also results in author spamicity estimates ( probability of spamming ) facilitating ranking of authors based on spamicity which is our main focus . 2.2 Observed Features Here we propose some characteristics of abnormal behaviors which are likely to be linked with spamming and thus can be exploited as observed features in our model for learning the spam

It is thus useful to capture the content similarity of reviews ( using cosine similarity ) of the same author . We chose the maximum similarity to capture the worst spamming behavior . ( 1 ) and non spam clusters . We first list the author features and then the review features . The notations are listed in Table 1 . Author Features : Author features have values in [ 0 , 1 ] . A value close to 1 ( respectively 0 ) indicates spamming ( non spamming ) . reviews in a single day also indicates an abnormal behavior . This feature computes the maximum number of reviews in a day for an author and normalizes it by the maximum value for our data .

Genuine reviewers , however , use their accounts from time to time to post reviews . It is thus useful to exploit the activity freshness of an account in detecting spamming . We define reviewing burstiness using the activity window ( difference of first and last review posting dates ) . If reviews are posted over a reasonably long timeframe , it probably indicates normal activity .

Hence , spammers would try to be among the first reviewers for products as this enables them to control the sentiment [ 26 ] . We compute the ratio of first reviews to total reviews for each author .

5 . Duplicate/Near Duplicate Reviews ( 𝑫𝑼𝑷 ) : Spammers often capture this phenomenon , we compute the review feature ( 𝑓𝐷𝐷𝐷 ) 𝑓𝐷𝐷𝐷(𝑟𝑎)=𝑓5(𝑎,𝑟)=�1,∃𝑟∈𝑅𝑝=𝑝(𝑟𝑎 ) 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑒(𝑟𝑎,𝑟)>𝛽1 𝑓𝐷𝐷𝐷 attains a value of 1 for a review 𝑟𝑎 by an author 𝑎 on product 𝑝 , if it is similar ( using cosine similarity based on some threshold , 𝛽1= 0.7 ( say ) ) to any other review on 𝑝 . 𝛽1 is estimated in §31 6 . Extreme Rating ( 𝑬𝑿𝑻 ) : On a 5 star ( ⋆ ) rating scale , it reflects extreme ratings ( 1⋆ or 5⋆ ) in order to demote/promote products . 𝑓𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑟𝑎)=𝑓6(𝑎,𝑟)=�1,⋆(𝑟𝑎,𝑝(𝑟𝑎))∈{1,5} 0,⋆(𝑟𝑎,𝑝(𝑟𝑎))∈{2,3,4} 7 .

Early Time Frame ( 𝑬𝑻𝑭 ) : [ 26 ] argues that spammers often wrong projection either in the positive or negative light so as to alter the true sentiment on products . This hints that ratings of spammers often deviate from the average ratings given by other reviewers . This feature attains the value of 1 if the rating deviation review early to inflict spam as the early reviews can greatly impact people ’s sentiment on a product . To capture this spamming characteristic , we propose the following feature :

§31 ) The definition says that if the latest review is beyond 7 months of product launch , it is no longer considered to be early . At the other extreme , if reviews are posted just after launch this
𝐸𝑇𝐹(𝑟𝑎,𝑝 ) captures how early an author 𝑎 reviewed the product 𝑝 . 𝛿 = 7 months is a threshold for denoting earliness ( estimated in feature attains a value of 1 . 𝛽3 is the corresponding threshold 9 . Rating Abuse ( 𝑹𝑨 ) : This feature captures the abuse caused by 𝐷𝑈𝑃 , it focuses on the rating dimension rather than content . Rating abuse , 𝑅𝐴(𝑎,𝑝 ) is defined by the similarity of ratings of an author , 𝑎 towards a product , 𝑝 across multiple reviews by the 𝑓𝑅𝑅(𝑟𝑎)=𝑓9(𝑎,𝑟)=�1,𝑅𝐴(𝑎,𝑝(𝑟𝑎))>𝛽4 0,𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒 𝑅𝐴(𝑎,𝑝)=|𝑅𝑎,𝑝|�1−14�max𝑟∈𝑅𝑎,𝑝(⋆(𝑟,𝑝))−min𝑟∈𝑅𝑎,𝑝(⋆(𝑟,𝑝))�� ( 9 ) correct use ) , the feature attains lower values . 𝛽4 is the rating abuse
The similarity of multiple star rating is computed using the difference between maximum and minimum star rating on a 5 star scale to capture consistent high/low ratings . The normalization constant is 4 as it is the maximum possible rating difference . For multiple ratings in genuine cases where ratings change ( eg , after threshold indicating spamming and is estimated in §31 2.3 Process In ASM , spam detection is influenced by review and author features . Normalized continuous author features in [ 0 , 1 ] are author weighted by the total number of reviews on the product .

) ( Table

However , review features being more objective , we found that they are better captured when modeled as binary variables being emitted from a Bernoulli for each review for each author modeled as following a Beta distribution ( 𝑦𝑎,𝑟𝑓~ 𝜓𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} 𝑓 � ( Table 1 ) . 𝜃𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} distribution ( 𝑥𝑎,𝑟𝑓~𝐵𝑒𝑟𝑛 �𝜃𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} 𝑓 𝑓 feature 𝑓∈{𝐷𝑈𝑃,𝐸𝑋𝑇,𝐷𝐸𝑉,𝐸𝑇𝐹,𝑅𝐴} and 𝜓𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} 𝑓 feature 𝑓∈{𝐶𝑆,𝑀𝑁𝑅,𝐵𝑆𝑇,𝑅𝐹𝑅} denote the per class/cluster ( spam vs . non spam ) probability of emitting feature 𝑓 . Latent variables 𝑠𝑎 and 𝜋𝑟 denote the spamicity of an author , 𝑎 and the ( spam/non spam ) class of each review , 𝑟 .

Emit author features 𝑓∈{𝐶𝑆,,𝑅𝐹𝑅} : 𝑦𝑟𝑎𝑓 ~ 𝜓𝜋𝑟𝑎𝑓 ;
We note that the observed author features are placed in the review plate ( Figure 1 ) . This is because each author behavior can be thought of as percolating through reviews of that author and emitted across each review to some extent . Doing this renders two key advantages : i ) It permits us to exploit a larger co occurrence domain . ii ) It paves the way for a simpler sampling distribution providing for faster inference . 2.4 Inference We employ approximate posterior inference with Monte Carlo Gibbs sampling , and use Rao Blackwellization [ 2 ] to reduce
As observed author features obtaining values in [ 0 , 1 ] are modeled as continuous Beta distributions , sparsity is considerably reduced sampling variance by collapsing on the latent variables 𝑠 and 𝜃𝑓 . as far as parameter estimation of 𝜓𝑓∈{𝐶𝐵,…𝑅𝐸𝑅} is concerned . Hence , to ensure speed , we estimate 𝜓𝑘𝑓using the method of moments ,

End if and 112,055 products . Below we describe parameter estimation , baseline systems , and evaluation results . 3.1 Learning Observed Feature Thresholds As noted in §2.2 , the proposed feature constructions contain thresholds . The thresholds can either be set heuristically or learned using some weak supervision . In this work , we use weak supervision to learn the thresholds from the Amazon group spam dataset in [ 29 ] , which provides a small set of labeled spammer groups and their reviews . Using this small set of available data is not a limitation of our method because the actual spamicty modeling of ASM still remains unsupervised as it does not use any spamicty labels for authors/reviews in model building . In fact , ASM does not have any response variable ( eg , [ 28 , 36 ] ) where supervision can be fed using labels . To keep evaluation fair , the labeled data in [ 29 ] is not used for our evaluation in §33
Thresholds of burstiness , 𝜏 = 28 days and earliness , 𝛿 = 7 months ( in §2.2 ) were estimated using greedy hill climbing search maximizing the likelihood of the data in [ 29 ] . It is also important to note that above thresholds apply to feature constructions in §2.2 and not specific to ASM . As we will see in §3.2 , the same features are used by other baseline methods , so improvements of ASM are attributed to its process and not the choice of feature thresholds .

( eg , set of authors/reviewers ) that need to be ranked relative to because any value in [ 0 , 1 ] is equally likely to be assigned to the Beta distributed variables and the model doesn’t benefit from any domain knowledge based priors . Posterior estimates are drawn after 3000 iterations with an initial burn in of 250 iterations . ASM with Informed Priors ( ASM IP ) : Here we employ guidance using some domain knowledge heuristics . Amazon tags each review with AVP ( Amazon Verified Purchase ) if the reviewer actually bought the product . Keeping other settings the settings fixed as ASM UP . 322 Unsupervised Rank Aggregation bought a single product on Amazon are likely to be less reliable ( hence probably spamming ) than those who also review products that they have purchased on Amazon ( ie , receiving AVP tags ) . ASM with Hyperparameter Estimation ( ASM HE ) : This behaviors as ranking functions in [ 0 , 1 ] with extreme values 0 ( respectively 1 ) indicating non spamming ( spamming ) on various behavior dimensions . Then , estimating the final spamicites of authors becomes unsupervised rank learning using aggregation [ 21 ] . The problem setting is described as follows . same as ASM UP , for each author , 𝑎 , if none of his reviews have set 𝑠𝑎~𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎(5,1 ) , else we 𝑠𝑎~𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎(1,5)1 .

Let 𝑞∈𝑄 denote a query and 𝑟∶𝑄×𝑋→ℝ denote a ranking function whose output governs the rank position of an item , ie , 𝑟(𝑞,𝑥)> 𝑟(𝑞,𝑥′ ) specifies that 𝑥 is ranked higher than 𝑥′ on query 𝑞 using ranking function 𝑟 . The notation 𝑟𝑢≻𝜖𝑟𝑣 signifies that the ranking function 𝑟𝑢 is better than 𝑟𝑣 with respect to a certain of ranking functions , {𝑟𝑖}𝑖=1𝑀 , rank aggregation learns the optimal ranking function , 𝑟𝑂𝑝𝑡 ( using a weighted combination of {𝑟𝑖}𝑖=1𝑀 ) such that ∀𝑖,𝑟𝑂𝑝𝑡≻𝜖𝑟𝑖 . This problem setting is also called Employ a learning algorithm to learn the parameters of 𝑟𝑂𝑝𝑡 . In have 9 ranking functions {𝑟𝑖}𝑖=1𝑀=9 corresponding to the 9 behavior feature dimensions ( in §22 ) For each author feature , 𝑓1…4∈ {𝐶𝑆,𝑀𝑁𝑅,𝐵𝑆𝑇,𝑅𝐹𝑅} , we directly use the value of the feature as the ranking function while for each review feature , 𝑓5…9∈ {𝐷𝑈𝑃,𝐸𝑋𝑇,𝐷𝐸𝑉,𝐸𝑇𝐹,𝑅𝐴} , we take the expected value of the since 𝑓1…9 being anomalous reviewing behaviors are likely to be 1 A potential non spammer ( NS ) , 𝑠𝑀𝐵~𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎(1,5 ) has an expected value , 𝐸[𝑠𝑀𝐵]= 16 which is much smaller than a potential spammer ( S ) , 𝑠𝑀𝐵~𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎(5,1 ) , with expected value , 𝐸[𝑠𝐵]=56 in the range [ 0 , 1 ] . unsupervised rank fusion or ensemble ranking [ 44 ] . In the supervised setting , one usually employs regression to learn the weights [ 41 ] . In the unsupervised setting , the approach is twofold : i ) Derive an incidental/surrogate supervision signal . ii ) feature across all reviews of an author the corresponding author feature . We then directly use the value of each author feature as a ranking function to produce 9 training ranks . Given no other knowledge , this is a reasonable approach correlated with spammers ( the nature of correlation will be detailed using posterior density analysis in §4 ) . Thus , the training

In our case of ranking reviewers according to spamicites , we to compute
Each instance/author in a training ranking is represented as a ranking produced by each feature function is based on a certain spamicity dimension . However , none of the training rankings may be optimal . We employ learning to rank [ 27 ] to learn an optimal
Learning to rank [ 27 ] is a supervised technique that takes a set of rankings for training and produces a single optimal aggregated ranking function . Each of our training rankings is produced by ranking function by aggregating 9 ranking functions {𝑓𝑖}𝑖=1𝑀=9 . sorting instances ( authors ) based on values of a feature in {𝑓𝑖}𝑖=1𝑀=9 . vector of 𝑓1…9 spam features . We experimented with two popular learning to rank algorithms : SVMRank [ 17 ] and RankBoost [ 47 ] . For SVMRank , we used the system in [ 17 ] . RankBoost was from RankLib2 . We use the pair wise L2 loss metric as the optimization criterion for RankBoost and SVMRank . We also experimented with RankNet , AdaRank , Coordinate Ascent in RankLib , but their results were poorer and hence not included . 323 Feature Value Sum and Helpfulness with the following baseline approaches :
For a more comprehensive comparison , we also experiment
Feature Sum ( FSum ) : As each feature 𝑓1…9 measures spam behavior on a specific dimension , an obvious approach is to rank the authors in descending order of the sum of all feature values . Helpfulness Score ( HS ) : In many review sites ( eg , Amazon ) , readers can provide helpfulness feedback to each review . It is reasonable less helpfulness feedback . HS uses the mean helpfulness score ( percentage of people who found a review helpful ) of reviews of each reviewer to rank reviewers in ascending order of the scores . that spam reviews should get to assume
Finally , we note that although in ASM spam detection is modeled as clustering ( §2.3 ) , our key task is to estimate author spamcities ( the posterior on the latent variable , 𝑠𝑎~𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎∈[0,1 ] ) for ranking authors according to their spamicities Standard clustering algorithms ( eg , k means ) are not suitable baselines because they only produce clusters , but do not generate a ranking of authors . 3.3 Evaluation Results As noted in §1 , we are not aware of any gold standard ground truth labeled data for opinion spammers . Hence , this work focuses on Bayesian inference in the unsupervised setting . To evaluate the author spamicities computed by different systems , we use two methods : review classification and human evaluation .
Running the systems in §3.2 on our data generates a ranking of 50,704 reviewers . However , human evaluation on all authors is clearly impossible . Even for review classification , the number of reviews is huge for such a large number of reviewers . We thus sample the rank positions 1 , 10 , 20,… , 50000 ( with a sampling lag/interval of 10 ranks ) to construct the evaluation set , 𝐸 of 5000 performance on 𝐸 is a good approximation over the entire range .
5000 is reasonable for review classification , but for human evaluation we need to use a subset ( see below ) . 331 Review Classification rank positions . Using a fixed sampling lag ensures
This is a new evaluation method in the unsupervised setting . The idea is that if ASM is effective , it must rank the highly likely spammers at the top and highly likely non spammers at the bottom . We use a supervised classification of likely spammers and likely non spammers this ranking . Instead of classifying reviewers , we classify their reviews . to evaluate
Prior works in psycholinguistic research ( eg [ 32 ] ) have shown that faking or lying usually involves more use of personal that

The hypothesis has been attested in [ 34 ] where text classification using n gram features have been shown quite effective in detecting spam and non spam reviews . Thus , if our classification of reviews based on text features is good , it implies that the ASM ranking of reviewers according to spamicites is effective because text classification concurs with the abnormal behavior spam detection of ASM . The key characteristic of this classification is that the text features have not been used in ASM . Clearly , using the same set of features will not be meaningful .
SVMRank and RankBoost by 4 % in F1 and 2 3 % in accuracy . 5 . For k = 15 % , ASM variants outperform other methods and increase F1 by a margin of 2 10 % and accuracy by 3 7 % . 6 . Performance of HS remains much poorer and similar for each k showing that it is not able to rank spammers well , indicating that helpfulness is not a good metric for spam detection . In fact , helpfulness votes are subject to abuse .
We note that no significance test is applied here to compare performance of different methods because each method uses different reviews in classification as the output rankings from the systems are different . However , we experimented with multiple and different randomized binning in 5 fold CV which showed the same trend as in Table 2 .
To further analyze the nature of spam and non spam reviews by spammers and nonspammers ( based on the rankings of ASM ) , we do an additional experiment . We consider the top 15 % authors ranked by ASM HE and randomly split them into two sets of authors and construct two classes of reviews coming from each set of authors . Classification on this set of reviews ( coming from two sets of authors belonging to spammers ) yielded 57 % accuracy . Similarly , classification of reviews by two sets of authors belonging to non spammers ( bottom 15 % ranked authors of ASMHE ) yielded 58 % accuracy . We tried different random selection of authors which also yielded similar accuracies . We note that the accuracy is greater than 50 % but less than the classification accuracy using ASM HE ( Table 2 ) . This shows that the above experiment is likely to separate authors and not spam vs . nonspam reviews . As different authors have differences in writing , the accuracy is greater than 50 % ( random guessing ) . But it is lower than spam and non spam review classification because reviews of both classes come from spammers ( or non spammers ) and hence noisy . Our result of author classification is supported by prior studies in [ 20 ] which showed that authorship attribution using n grams is not very effective . It also indirectly shows that a lower accuracy obtained by various competitors in Table 2 have more noise in ranking authors based on spamicity .
These results render confidence in the proposed models . It also indirectly shows that there are some linguistic differences between spam and non spam reviews . 332 Human Evaluation
Our second evaluation is based on human expert judgment , which is commonly used in research on spam , eg , Web [ 3 , 38 ] , email [ 5 ] , and even blogs and social spam [ 22 ] . Human evaluation has also been used for opinion spam in prior works [ 42 , 46 ] . It is however important to note that just by reading a single review without any context , it is very hard to determine whether a review is fake ( spam ) or not [ 34 ] . However , it has been shown in [ 29 ] that when sufficient context is provided eg , reviewing patterns , ratings , type/brand of products reviewed , posting activity trails , etc . , human expert evaluation becomes easier .
For this work , we used 3 domain expert judges : employees at Rediff Shopping ; eBay.in for evaluating our ranked reviewers based on spamicites . The judges had sufficient background in reviews of products and sellers due to their nature of their work in online shopping . The judges were briefed with many opinion spam signals : i ) Having zero caveats , and full of empty adjectives . ii ) Purely glowing praises with no downsides . iii ) Suspicious brand affinity/aversion , posting trails , etc . , from prior findings and
For this set of experiments , we consider the reviews from the top k % ranked authors to be in the spam ( + ) class while reviews from the bottom k % of the ranked authors to be in the non spam ( – ) class . Although the actual percentage of spammers is unknown , deception prevalence studies [ 33 , 43 ] have reported 815 % spam rate in online review sites . We thus report results for k = 5 % , 10 % , and 15 % . We induce a linear kernel SVM3 using SVMLight [ 16 ] and report 5 fold cross validation results in Table 2 . The features are 1 3 grams . We note the following observations : 1 . As k increases , we find a monotonic degradation in review classification performance ( except HS ) which is expected as the spamicities of top and bottom authors get closer which makes the corresponding review classification harder .
2 . For k = 5 % , ASM models performs best on F1 and Accuracy metrics . Next in order are FSum , RankBoost , and SVMRank . It is interesting that the simple baseline FSum performs quite well for k = 5 % . The reason is attributed to the fact that the top positions are mostly populated by heavy spammers while the bottom positions are populated by genuine reviewers and hence a naïve un weighted FSum could capture this phenomenon .
3 . For k = 10 , 15 % , FSum does not perform so well ( SVMRank and RankBoost outperform Fsum ) . This is because for k = 10 , 15 % , the ranked positions involve more difficult cases of authors/reviewers and a mere sum is not able to balance the feature weights as not all features are equally discriminating .
4 . For k = 10 % , SVMRank and RankBoost outperform ASM UP and perform close to ASM IP . ASM HE still outperforms
3 Other kernels , eg , polynomial , rbf , sigmoid didn’t perform so well . Linear kernel has been shown effective for text classification by many researchers , eg , [ 18 ] . consumer sites [ 1 , 12 ] . These signals are sensible as they have been compiled by consumer domain experts with extensive knowhow on fake reviews . Our judges were also familiar with Amazon reviews and given access to additional metadata , eg , reviewing profile , demographic information , etc . Although the judges were not provided the proposed features , they were encouraged to use their own signals along with the above existing signals and reviewer metadata . It is important here to note that providing various signals compiled from prior works and domain experts in consumer sites [ 1 , 12 ] to the judges does not introduce a bias but enhances judgment . Without any signals , as mentioned above , it is very difficult to judge by merely reading reviews . It is also hard for anyone to know a large number of signals without extensive experience in opinion spam detection . Given a reviewer and his reviews , the judges were asked to independently examine his entire profile and to provide a label as spammer or non spammer . Due to the large number ( 5000 ) of reviewers in the evaluation set , 𝐸 , it would have taken too much time for human judges to assess all the reviewers in 𝐸 . We selected the following three B1 ( Top 50 ) : Reviewers ranked from 1 to 50 by each system in 𝐸 . B3 ( Bottom 50 ) : Reviewers ranked at bottom 50 ranks in 𝐸 . This is reasonable because these rank positions in 𝐸 reflect the performance trend on the entire range . Table 3 reports the results of each judge ( as the count of reviewers labeled as spammers ) for each bucket across each method . Additionally , we report the agreement of judges using Fleiss multi rater kappa [ 11 ] for each method in the last row of Table 3 . We note the following observations : 1 . All 3 judges perform similarly with slight variation ( eg , J1 seems to be stricter and identifies more spammers in each bucket than J3 ) . This shows that the judges have consensus in spam judgments . Further , the kappa values being in the range of substantial agreement according to scale4 in [ 23 ] bolsters confidence in the judgments . ranked buckets ( B1 , B2 , B3 ) for evaluation by our judges :
B2 ( Middle 50 ) : Reviewers ranked from 2501 to 2550 .
4 No agreement ( κ < 0 ) , slight agreement ( 0 < κ ≤ 0.2 ) , fair agreement ( 0.2 < κ ≤ 0.4 ) , moderate agreement ( 0.4 < κ ≤ 0.6 ) , substantial agreement ( 0.6 < κ ≤ 0.8 ) , and almost perfect agreement for 0.8 < κ ≤ 10
2 . For all methods except HS , we find the average number of spammers detected by judges decreasing monotonically for buckets B1 , B2 , and B3 which is expected from the ranking produced by the algorithms . HS performs poorly ( placing more spammers in B2 , B3 which is undesireable ) as also observed in §331 Thus , helpfulness votes aren’t useful for spam detection . 3 . For B1 , ASM HE performs best . On average , it is able to place 39 spammers in the top 50 rank positions . ASM IP , RankBoost , and SVMRank perform poorer than ASM HE . ASM UP does not perform well as uninformed priors are weaker .
4 . For B2 , the performance order is ASM HE → ASM IP → RankBoost → FSum → ASM UP → SVMRank . At this bucket , a good method should place fewer spammers as B2 is in the middle . This is indeed the case in Table 3 . Note that an ideal ranking should not place any spammers in the middle range as it is very unlikely that 50 % of the reviewers are spammers .
5 . For the last bucket , B3 , we find ASM HE and FSum performing best by not placing any spammers in the bottom ranks . ASM IP does quite well too . Next in performance order are RankBoost → SVMRank → ASM UP . FSum performed very well in B3 because its ranking ( based on descending order of feature sum value ) placed authors who ranked very low in all features . As the features are all abnormal and indicate suspicious behaviors , reviewers attaining very low FSum values are likely to be for each feature
, 𝜓𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} 𝑓 spam reviews and authors corresponding to each observed author genuine reviewers which explain the good results of FSum . In summary , we can conclude that proposed ASM HE is effective and outperforms other methods and baselines . ASM IP and ASM UP are slightly inferior which is reasonable as they use weaker priors . Learning to rank methods SVMRank and RankBoost using proposed behaviors are strong competitors showing that the proposed behavior features are effective . 4 . POSTERIOR ANALYSIS Apart from generating a ranking of authors based on spamicity non spam distributions for each anomalous/spamming dimension or feature ( §2.2 ) , it is still worthwhile to study the estimates to see whether they reflect our understanding of spamming behaviors .
( 𝑠𝑎 ) , ASM also estimates the latent distributions of spam and nonand review feature dimension 𝑓 as reflected in the spam vs . nonfor 𝐾 = 2 clusters , , 𝜓𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} spam clusters or classes , ie , 𝜃𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} 𝑓 𝑓 𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} ( Table 1 ) . It is thus interesting to analyze the posterior on the learned distributions 𝜃𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} , 𝜓𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} 𝑓 𝑓 dimension 𝑓 . Although these are model ’s estimates of spam and distributions under each feature 𝑓 ( 𝜃𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} , 𝜓𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} 𝑓 𝑓 estimated densities of 𝜃𝑓~𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎 and 𝜓𝑓~𝐵𝑒𝑡𝑎 for spam and non(𝜃𝑘∈{𝑠̂,𝑛�} 𝑓
We report the posterior on the latent spam and non spam ) estimated by ASM HE using MC EM ( Algorithm 2 ) . Due to space constraints , we only focus on ASM HE as it performed best . We plot the spam clusters in Figure 2 . For each estimated latent distribution ) , we show the density of spam in red ( solid ) lines and non spam in blue ( dotted ) lines . Furthermore , the spam and non spam densities being different are shown in their respective scales ( secondary y axes , left : blue/dotted for non spam and right : solid/red for spam ) . The x axis is the domain of the Beta distribution , [ 0 , 1 ] which is also the range of the corresponding observed ( author and review ) feature where values close to 0 and 1 show extremes of non spamming and spamming ( author and review ) . Also shown are the expected values for each latent behavior for spam ( red/dashed lines ) and non spam ( blue/dashdotted lines ) in respective scales and figure captions . We compare and explain the estimated trends of each behavior feature ( see §2.2 ) across spam and non spam classes below . see that most spammers have a lot of content similarity in their reviews while non spammers exhibit much less review similarity . The expected value of content similarity ( using cosine similarity ) for non spammers is 0.09 , much lower than 0.7 for spammers .
Content Similarity ( 𝝍𝑪𝑺 ) : From the densities in Figure 2 ( a ) , we Maximum Number of Reviews ( 𝝍𝑴𝑵𝑹 ) : Figure 2 ( b ) shows the This shows that non spammers attain much lower values for 𝑀𝑁𝑅 . 034 We recall that this feature , 𝑀𝑁𝑅 is normalized by the largest difference of densities for this behavior . The density curve for non spammers attaining the peak towards the left of the plot has majority of the probability mass concentrated towards the left .
Spammers on the other hand have their masses concentrated at the middle with the density curve attaining a peak at a feature value of value for this feature ( maximum number of reviews in a day ) in our data which happens to be 21 . This imples that a significant percentage of spammers have written close to 0.34 × 21 ≈ 7 reviews in a single day . In expectation , we see that the maximum number of reviews in a day for non spammers is 0.11 , ie , 0.11 × 21 ≈ 2 reviews while 0.28 × 21 ≈ 5 reviews for spammers .
Reviewing Burstiness ( 𝝍𝑩𝑺𝑻 ) : Reviewing busrtiness measures post date ) within the estimated threshold 𝜏 = 28 days . At one extreme , reviewers with overall posting activity more than 28 days obtain a value of 0 while at other extreme reviewers whose last and first post are very close attain value close to 1 .

Figure 2 ( c ) , we find that density of non spam class attains a peak at the feature value 0 , showing a large percentage of non spammers post reviews spanned over more than 28 days . This is intuitive as genuine reviewers use their accounts from time to time to post reviews . For spammers , the density attains a peak at feature value 0.89 ( ie , 28×(1 0.89 ) ≈ 3 days showing that a considerable percentage of spmamers never use their accounts after 3 days from the first post date . Further the expected account acitvity period for spammers is 0.75 , ie , 28 × ( 1 0.75 ) ≈ 7 days . The expected value for non spammers is 0.01 which is negligible showing most non spammers have account activities ( by posting reviews ) for more than 28 days .
Ratio of First Reviews ( 𝝍𝑹𝑭𝑹 ) : As defined earlier , this behavior computes the ratio of first reviews to total reviews per account ( reviewer ) . First review means that a review was posted first for a given product . From Figure 2 ( d ) , we see that unlike previous behaviors , the separation between spammers and non spammers is not so disticnt . Although in expectation , the estimated behavior attains a value of 0.36 for spammers which is higher than 0.29 for non spammers , the density profile for non spammers remains somewhat high . A plausible reason for this phenomenon is that there are many enthusiastic genuine reviewers who review newly launched products . Spammers obtain higher values in expectation as reviewing first/early can give them an edge as early reviews have more impact [ 26 ] . Duplicate/Near Dulpicate Reviews on Products

0 posted on a product is similar to other reviews on that product . This behavior can detect some sockpuppets where a person posts similar reviews on a product with multiple ids . There can also be multiple similar review posts by a single id . In either cases , this behvarior would return high values for a review when it is a duplicate/near dulpicate to other reviews on that product . From Figure 2 ( e ) , we see stark difference of densities of spam and non spam reviews based on this behavior . Spam reviews attain higher values ( with density peak at extreme right ) while non spam reviews attain very low values ( with peak density at extreme left ) .
Extreme Rating ( 𝜽𝑬𝑿𝑻 ) : Extreme review rating is a boolean review feature . Its corresponding latent behavior , 𝜃𝐸𝐸𝐸 measures the extent to which reviews are rated with extreme rating ( 1 or 5 star rating ) on the scale [ 0 , 1 ] . Form Figure 2 ( f ) , we see that the density of spam reviews is concentrated towards the extreme right . Its expected value is 0.86 which implies that about 86 % percent of spam reviews are rated with either 1 or 5 stars . For nonspam reviews , we find a somewhat evenly distributed density profile because genuine reviewers usually have different rating levels . The expected value for non spam reviews is 0.36 , ie , about 36 % of non spam reviews are extreme while the rest 64 % is distributed across 2 , 3 , and 4 star ratings according to the density . review is the extent to which its rating deviates from the average rating ( general rating consensus ) on the product . Its corresponding
Rating Deviation ( 𝜽𝑫𝑬𝑽 ) : Recall that rating deviation for a normalized latent behavior is 𝜃𝐷𝐸𝐷 . From the densities in Figure 2
( g ) , we find that spam reviews deviate a great deal in rating from the general rating consensus . For non spam reviews we find the density peak is attained at the feature value of 0.12 showing that a considerable percentage of non spam reviews don’t deviate very much in ratings from the average rating . The expected rating deviation is 0.68 for spam reviews which is almost double of the expected deviation of 0.34 for non spam reviews .

Estimated posterior densities for Early Time Frame ( 𝜽𝑬𝑻𝑭 ) : ETF behavior measures how early bevarior , 𝜃𝐸𝐸𝐸 . We recall from §3.1 that the estimated threshold for this feature is 𝛿 = 7 months . So , 0 values indicate that reviews was a review posted in reference to the product ’s launch date . We find something very interesting in its corresponding latent feature , were posted after 7 months of launch date and values close to 1 indicate review posts close to the lauch date . From the density plot in Figure 2 ( h ) , we find that the mass for non spam cluster is concentrated close to 0 with the expected value of 0.28 showing that relatively fewer ( 28 % ) of non spam reviews for a product are posted early within 7 months of launch . This is possible as not all genuine reviews for a product are posted early within 7 months of launch . In fact , the bulk of the genuine reviews get accumulated overtime . We note that these statistics are in expectation and not for any single product . The 28 % of genuine early reviews can be attributed to reviewing enthusiasts with keen interests in the products . For spam reviews , we find that the density tends to lean towards the right , but not extremely concentrated towards the right . It attains an expected value of 0.61 showing that about 61 % spam reviews are posted within 7 months of product lauch date while the rest spam reviews accumulate later in the timeline . This dovetails with the findings in [ 26 ] that spammers usually post reviews early enough to cast a bigger impact .
Rating Abuse ( 𝜽𝑹𝑨 ) : Rating abuse measures the extent products corresponding latent beharior , 𝜃𝐸𝐸𝐸 are shown in Figure 2 ( i ) . We find that a reasonably large percentage of spam reviews ( 70 % in expectation ) have been instances of imparting rating abuse ( ie , among the multiple reviews/ratings for the same product by the same reviewer id ) . However for non spam reviews , the expected are spammed with multiple ratings . The densities for its value for this behavior is 013 Thus , most non spam reviews ( ≈ 100 13 = 87 % ) are not instances of rating abuse ( ie , are single reviews by a reviewer on a product ) . Again , we note that our model estimates 13 % of non spam reviews being instances of rating abuse ( ie , multiple ratings on a product by a reviewer ) which is a small percentage . However , from the non spam density we can say that the feature values for those reviews must be very low as the density drops to almost 0 beyond the feature value of 05 Again , this is understandable as sometimes a reviewer might review a prodcut more than once when the product experience changes from the first review ( eg , a installation fault , not knowing the correct method of using , etc )
Lastly , we note that although it is interesting to analyze the relative discriminative strength of each feature , it is not directly possible as we do not have ground truth spamicity labels for reviewers in our data . Instead , the posterior denisity estimates of latent bahviors give us some clues to relative feature strengths . 5 . CONCLUSIONS This paper proposed a novel and principled method to exploit observed reviewing behaviors to detect opinion spammers ( fake reviewers ) in an unsupervised Bayesian inference framework . To our knowledge , this is the first such attempt . Existing methods are mostly based on heuristics and/or ad hoc labels for opinion spam detection . The proposed model has its basis in the theoretic foundation of probabilistic model based clustering . The Bayesian framework facilitates characterization of many behavioral phenomena of opinion spammers using the estimated latent population distributions . It also enables detection and posterior density analysis in a single framework . This cannot be done by any of the existing methods . The paper also proposed a novel way to evaluate the results of unsupervised opinion spam models using supervised classification without the need of any manually labeled data . Finally , a comprehensive set of experiments based on the proposed automated classification evaluation and human expert evaluation have been conducted to evaluate the proposed model . The results across both evaluation metrics show that the proposed model is effective and outperforms strong competitors . 6 .
