ABSTRACT Every day millions of users are connected through online social networks , generating a rich trove of data that allows us to study the mechanisms behind human interactions . Triadic closure has been treated as the major mechanism for creating social links : if Alice follows Bob and Bob follows Charlie , Alice will follow Charlie . Here we present an analysis of longitudinal micro blogging data , revealing a more nuanced view of the strategies employed by users when expanding their social circles . While the network structure affects the spread of information among users , the network is in turn shaped by this communication activity . This suggests a link creation mechanism whereby Alice is more likely to follow Charlie after seeing many messages by Charlie . We characterize users with a set of parameters associated with different link creation strategies , estimated by a Maximum Likelihood approach . Triadic closure does have a strong effect on link formation , but shortcuts based on traffic are another key factor in interpreting network evolution . However , individual strategies for following other users are highly heterogeneous . Link creation behaviors can be summarized by classifying users in different categories with distinct structural and behavioral characteristics . Users who are popular , active , and influential tend to create traffic based shortcuts , making the information diffusion process more efficient in the network .

INTRODUCTION
User activity in online social networks is exploding . Social and micro blogging networks such as Facebook , Twitter , and Google Plus every day host the information sharing activity of billions of users . Using these systems , people communicate ideas , opinions , videos , and photos among their circles of friends and followers across the world . These interactions generate an unprecedented amount of data that can be used as a social observatory , providing a unique opportunity to shed light on the mechanisms of human communication with a quantitative approach [ 38 , 15 , 36 , 27 , 59 , 60 ] .
Research on social media revolves around two main themes : communication and its social network substrate . Most network models focus on either the structural growth of the system — the dynamics of the network — or information diffusion processes — the dynamics on the network . The present work establishes a feedback loop between these two dynamics .
Much effort has been devoted to modeling the evolution of social networks [ 62 , 9 , 46 , 27 ] . Among proposed mechanisms of how a link is created , triadic closure [ 58 , 28 ] is a simple but powerful principle to model the evolution of social networks based on shared friends : two individuals with mutual friends have a higher than random chance to establish a link . In directed networks , such as
Dynamics of Network:Link CreationDynamics on Network:Information flowABAB Twitter or Yahoo! Meme , triadic closure implies a particular order with respect to the direction of links : once Alice follows Bob and Bob follows Charlie , Alice will follow Charlie . Triadic closure has been observed in both undirected and directed online social networks and incorporated into several network growth models [ 39 , 34 , 54 ] . However , most existing models do not take user activity — or how information spreads on the network — into consideration . Social micro blogging networks , such as Twitter , Google Plus , Sina Weibo , and Yahoo! Meme , are designed for information sharing . As illustrated in Fig 1 , the social network structure constrains communication patterns , but information propagated through the network also affect how agents behave and ultimately how the network changes and grows . In this paper we study the role of information diffusion in shaping the evolution of the network structure , and the individual strategies that bring about this effect by way of creating social links .
The major contribution of this paper is to present clear evidence that information diffusion affects network evolution at both systemwide and individual levels . In particular , we find that a considerable portion of new links are shortcuts based on information flow ( § 4 ) . There is significant statistical evidence for triadic closure as a link creation mechanism , but also that users tend to link to people who have generated content they have seen ( § 41 ) Furthermore , not all users apply the same strategy to grow their social connections ; users with high in degree tend to pay more attention to traffic ( § 42 ) However , shortcuts are not equally probable ; we find that users follow the most active sources of content ; purely topological mechanisms cannot account for these shortcuts ( § 43 ) As a result , traffic based shortcuts can make the social network more efficient in terms of information diffusion ( § 44 ) In § 5 , we perform a Maximum Likelihood Estimation analysis to quantify the system wide prevalence of different link creation strategies . Finally , the categorization of users suggests the existence of several distinct link formation behaviors ( § 6 ) . Our findings identify information diffusion dynamics as a key factor in the evolution of social networks .
2 . BACKGROUND
Early models concerning communication dynamics were inspired by studies of epidemics , assuming that a piece of information could pass from one individual to another through social contacts [ 52 , 25 , 18 , 4 , 2 ] . These models have been extended to include cascade phenomena [ 26 ] , factors that influence the speed of spreading such as information recency [ 43 ] , the heterogeneity in connectivity patterns [ 49 ] , clustering [ 47 ] , user created content [ 6 ] , and temporal connectivity patterns [ 44 , 11 , 12 , 51 ] . An alternative class of models is based on the idea of a threshold ; you propagate an idea when some number of friends communicate it to you [ 29 , 45 ] . These models are believed to be relevant in the diffusion of rumors , norms , and behaviors [ 14 ] , and have been extended to study the role of competition for finite attention [ 64 ] . The large majority of these studies consider either a static or annealed underlying social network , under the assumption that the network evolves on a longer ( slower ) time scale than the information spread . Recent research has addressed the modeling of intermediate cases , in which the two time scales are comparable . These approaches consider the two dynamics as either independent [ 53 , 50 ] or coupled [ 61 , 57 ] . The foundations of this last class of models are very similar to those explored in this paper . However , thus far , these models have focused mainly on epidemic processes in which links are deleted or rewired according to the disease status of each node [ 61 , 57 ] . The social systems considered in this paper are governed by quite different underlying mechanisms .
Models devoted to reproducing the growth and evolution of network topology have traditionally focused on defining basic mechanisms driving link creation [ 62 , 46 , 9 ] . From the first model proposed in 1959 by Erdös and Rényi [ 22 ] , many others have been introduced capturing different properties observed in real networks , such as the small world phenomenon [ 63 , 39 , 34 , 54 ] , large clustering coefficient [ 63 , 39 , 34 , 54 ] , temporal dynamics [ 51 , 53 ] , information propagation [ 8 ] , and heterogeneous distributions in connectivity patterns [ 7 , 33 , 37 , 35 , 20 , 23 ] . In particular , this latter property was first described by the preferential attachment [ 7 ] and copy models [ 37 ] .
In the social context , the rationale behind preferential attachment mechanisms is that people prefer linking to well connected individuals [ 7 ] . Although very popular , this prescription alone is not sufficient to reproduce other important features of social networks . Other models have been put forth to fill this gap , including ingredients such as homophily [ 31 , 42 , 48 , 1 , 24 ] and triadic closure [ 58 , 28 , 39 , 34 , 54 ] . Homophily describes the tendency of people to connect with others sharing similar features [ 42 , 31 ] . Its impact on link creation in large scale online networks is a recent topic of discussion [ 48 , 1 , 24 ] . The triadic closure mechanism is based on the intuition that two individuals with mutual friends have a higher probability to establish a link [ 58 , 28 ] . This tendency has been observed in both undirected and directed online social networks and incorporated into several network growth models [ 39 , 34 , 54 ] . In particular Leskovec et al . have tested triadic closure against many other mechanisms in four different large scale social networks [ 39 ] . By using Maximum Likelihood Estimation ( MLE ) [ 17 ] they have identified triadic closure as the best rule , among those considered , to explain link creation .
Link prediction algorithms , aimed at inferring new connection that may happen in the near future given a current snapshot of the network structure , could be used as ingredients for modeling network evolution . Common approaches consider link prediction as a classification task or ranking problem , using node similarity [ 40 , 32 ] , the hierarchical structure of the network [ 16 ] , random walks [ 3 ] , graphical models [ 41 ] , and user profile features [ 56 ] .
Although similar in spirit , our approach is different from this large body of literature . We do not consider link prediction , nor agent based simulations in which the structural behavior of each user is modeled by a set of rules . We adopt the MLE framework extending the work of Leskovec et al . [ 39 ] . We extend the notion of triadic closure by considering mechanisms based on traffic , or more in general , users activity . We explicitly study the coupling between the dynamics of and on the network , connecting these two previously separated themes of research , in the context of online social networks .
3 . MEME DATESET
We study Yahoo! Meme , a social micro blogging system similar to Twitter , which was active between 2009 and 2012 . We have access to the entire history of the system , including full records of every message propagation and link creation event , from April 2009 until March 2010 . A user j following a user i is represented in the follower network by a directed edge = ( i , j ) , indicating j can receive messages posted by i . We adopt this notation , in which the link creator is the target , to emphasize the direction of information flow . Edges are directed to account for asymmetric relations between users ; a node can follow another without being followed back . In our notation , the in degree of a node i is the number of people followed by i , and the out degree is the number of i ’s followers . Users can repost received messages , which become visible to their followers . When user j reposts content from i , we infer

( B ) Broad distributions of in degree and out degree in the follower network of Yahoo! Meme . Users were not allowed to follow more than 1,000 people , which is the maximum indegree a node can attain . a flow of information from i to j . Each link is weighted by the numbers of messages from i that are reposted or seen by j .
At the end of the observation period , the Yahoo! Meme follower network consisted of 128,199 users with at least one edge , connected by a total of 3,485,361 directed edges . Fig 2 displays general statistics about the growth and structure of the network .
4 . LINK CREATION MECHANISMS
When users post or repost messages , all their followers can see these posts and might decide to repost them , generating paths that together form cascade networks . When receiving a reposted message , a user in such a path can see both the grandparent ( G , the user two steps ahead in the path ) and the origin ( O , original source ) . A user may decide to follow a grandparent or origin , receiving their future messages directly . These new links create shortcuts connecting users at any distance in the network . A triadic closure occurs when a user follows a triadic node ( ∆ , the user two steps away in the follower network ) . The definitions of different types of link creation mechanisms are illustrated in Fig 3(A ) .
The Venn diagram in Fig 3(B ) shows the proportions of links of different types and the logical relationships between these sets of links . We observe that 84.8 % of new edges consist of triadic closures , 21.5 % form shortcuts to grandparent , and 19.5 % to origins . Note that not all the grandparents are triadic nodes , because users are allowed to repost messages from people they are not following in Yahoo! Meme . This account for 0.03 % of links . There is a large overlap between triadic closure links and traffic based shortcuts . This can be explained by the phenomenon that most real world information cascades are shallow [ 5 ] and thus triadic closure links and traffic based shortcuts coincide .
This evidence suggests that traffic based link creation mechanisms are an important complement to the triadic closure in model

( B ) Venn digram of the proportions of grandparent , origin , and triadic closure links among all existing edges . ing network evolution . Actions of posting and reposting induce the creation of shortcuts , shaping the structure of the network . Newly created links in turn determine what messages are seen by users , making the network more efficient at spreading information . 4.1 Statistical Analyses of Shortcuts
To quantify the statistical tendency of users to create shortcuts , let us consider every single link creation in the data as an independent event . We test the null hypotheses that links to grandparents , origins , and triadic nodes are generated by choosing targets at random among the users not already followed by the creator . We label each link by its creation order , 1 ≤ ≤ L , where L is the total number of links . For each link , we can compute the likelihood of following a grandparent by chance : pG( ) =
NG( )
N ( ) − k( ) − 1 where NG( ) is the number of distinct grandparents seen by the creator of at the moment when is about to be created ; N ( ) is the number of available users in the system when is to be created ; k( ) is the in degree of ’s creator at the same moment ; and the denominator is the number of potential candidates to be followed . The indicator function for each link denotes whether the link connects with a grandparent or not in the real data : fl 1 if links to a grandparent
1G( ) =
0 otherwise .
The expected number of links to grandparents according to the null hypothesis can be then computed as :

According to the Lyapunov central limit theorem,1 the variable zG = ( SG − EG)/σG is distributed according to a standard normal N ( 0 , 1 ) . For linking to origins ( O ) or triadic nodes ( ∆ ) , we can define zO and z∆ similarly . In all three cases , using a z test , we can reject the null hypotheses with high confidence ( p < 10−10 ) . We conclude that links established by following grandparents , origins or triadic nodes happen much more frequently than by random connection . These link creation mechanisms have important roles in the evolution of the social network . 4.2 User Preference
To study the dependence of the link formation tendencies on the G , zk different stages of an individual ’s lifetime , let us compute zk O ∆ for links created by users with in degree k , that is , those and zk who are following k users at the time when the link is created . Fig 4 shows that the principle of triadic closure dominates user behavior when one follows a small number of users ( k < 75 ) . In the early stages , one does not receive much traffic , so it is natural to follow people based on local social circles , consistently with triadic closure . However , users who have been active for a long time and have followed many people ( k > 75 ) have more channels through which they monitor traffic . This creates an opportunity to follow others from whom they have seen messages in the past . 4.3 Traffic Bias
Further inspection of the empirical data reveals that not all shortcuts are equally likely ; users tend to follow those who have often been sources of seen messages . To investigate this , consider all new shortcuts to grandparents or origins . For each shortcut , we rank all the available grandparent or origin candidates according to how many of their messages have been seen by the creator prior to the link formation . We plot the probability of a followed grandparent or origin having a certain rank percentile in Fig 5 . The plot clearly demonstrates that repeated exposure to contents posted by a user n increases the probability of following that user . This is analogous =1 E[(X( ) − p())4 ] n→∞−→ 0 1Lyapunov ’s condition , where X( ) is a random Bernoulli variable with success probability p( ) [ 10 ] , is consistent with numerical tests . Details are omitted for brevity .
1 σ4 n to the way in which we are more likely to adopt a piece of information or behavior to which we are exposed multiple times [ 6 , 14 , 55 , 30 ] . This observation shows that topology alone is insufficient to explain the evolution of the network ; activity patterns — the dynamics on the network — are a necessary ingredient in describing the formation of new links . 4.4 Link Efficiency
In information diffusion networks like Twitter and Yahoo! Meme , social links may have a key efficiency function of shortening the distance between information creators and consumers . An efficient link should be able to convey more information to the follower than others . Hence we define the efficiency of link as the average number of posts seen or reposted through during one time unit after its creation :
ηseen = wseen( ) T − t( )
,
ηrepost = wrepost( ) T − t( ) where w( ) is the number of messages seen or reposted through ; t( ) is the time when was created ; and T is the time of the last action recorded in our dataset . Both seen and reposted messages are considered , as they represent different types of traffic ; the former are what is visible to a user , and the latter are what a user is willing to share . We compute the link efficiency of every grandparent , origin , and triadic closure link . As shown in Fig 6 , both grandparent and origin links exhibit higher efficiency than triadic closure links , irrespective of the type of traffic . By shortening the paths of information flows , more posts from the content generators reach the consumers .
5 . RULES OF NETWORK EVOLUTION
To infer the different link creation strategies from the observed data , we characterize users with a set of probabilities associated with different actions , and approximate these parameters by Maximum Likelihood Estimation ( MLE ) [ 17 ] . For each link , we know the actual creator and the target ; we can thus compute the likelihood f ( |Γ , Θ ) of the target being followed by the creator according to a particular strategy Γ , given the network configuration Θ at the time when is created . The likelihoods associated with different strategies can be mixed according to the parameters to obtain a model of link creation behavior . Finally , assuming that link creation events are independent , we can derive the likelihood of obtaining the empirical network from the model by the product of likelihoods associated with every link . The higher the value of the likelihood function , the more accurate the model .
Rank percentile ( by traffic)P 5.1 Single Strategies
Let us consider five link creation mechanisms and their combi nations : Random ( Rand ) : follow a randomly selected user who is not yet followed .
Triadic closure ( ∆ ) : follow a randomly selected triadic node .
Grandparent ( G ) : follow a randomly selected grandparent .
Origin ( O ) : follow a randomly selected origin . Traffic shortcut ( G ∪ O ) : follow a randomly selected grandpar ent or origin .
Other mechanisms for link creation could be similarly incorporated , such as social balance [ 21 ] and preferential attachment [ 7 ] . However , preferential attachment is built on the assumption that everyone knows the global connectivity of everyone else , which is not realistic . The strategies considered here essentially reproduce and extend the copy model [ 37 ] , approximating preferential attachment with only local knowledge .
To model link creation with a single strategy , we can use a parameter p for the probability of using that strategy , while a random user is followed with probability 1 − p . The calculation of maximum likelihood , taking the single strategy of grandparents as an example , is as follows :
LG(p ) =

.
Note that since a follow action can be ascribed to multiple strategies , it can contribute to multiple terms in the log likelihood expression . For instance , a link could be counted in both f ( |G , Θ ) and f ( |Rand , Θ ) . For numerically stable computation , we maximize the log likelihood : log LG(p ) = p ln

Similar expressions of log likelihood can be obtained for other strategies ( ∆ , O , and G ∪ O ) . It is not trivial to obtain the best p analytically , so we explore the values of p ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) numerically ( Fig 7 ) . Triadic closure dominates as a single strategy , with p∆ = 0.82 , consistently with the large number of triadic closure links observed in the data . Trafficbased strategies alone account for about 20 % of the links . 5.2 Combined Strategies
For a more realistic model of the empirical data , let us consider combined strategies with both triadic closure and traffic based shortcuts . For each link , the follower with probability p1 creates a shortcut by linking to a grandparent ( G ) , an origin ( O ) , or either

Once again , many follow actions can create both triadic closure links and traffic shortcuts , so they can contribute to multiple terms in the log likelihood expression .
It is hard to obtain the optimal solution analytically . We numerically explore the values of p1 and p2 in the unit square to maximize the log likelihood . The best combined strategy is the one consid

The parameter settings and the maximum likelihood values for all tested models are listed in Table 1 . We can compare the quality of these models by comparing their maximized log L ’s . The combined models with both traffic shortcuts and triadic closure yield the best accuracy . In these models , triadic closure accounts for 71 % of the links , grandparents and origins for 12 % , and the rest are created at random .
Thus far we have assumed that each user has the same behavior ; in the next section we model each user separately .
6 . USER BEHAVIOR
The MLE models for describing the system behavior can be similarly employed to characterize the strategy of an individual user . Let us focus on the model G ∪ O + ∆ that best reproduces the empirical data at the global level . We run MLE to explain the links created by each user independently . We consider users with at least 20 in links , such that MLE is meaningful . For easier interpretation , let us call ptraffic = p1 , pstructure = p2 and prandom = 1−p1−p2 . Each user has her own set of parameters . 6.1 User Strategy Classification
Using the Expectation Maximization ( EM ) algorithm [ 13 , 19 ] , users are clustered into several classes based on ptraffic , pstructure

EM iteratively preforms an expectation step to compute the probability that each instance belongs to each class , and a maximization step in which latent variables of classes are altered to maximize the expected likelihood of the observed data . EM decides how many clusters to create by cross validation . This procedure yields five classes : Information Oriented ( Info ) : People prefer to follow someone from whom or through whom they have received messages . Friend of a Friend ( Friend ) : People follow users two steps away to form triadic closure , almost exclusively .
Casual Friendship ( CFrd ) : People tend to follow a set of users their friends are following ; they also link to random users occasionally .
Mixture ( Mix ) : Miscellaneous behavior of creating traffic shortcuts , connecting others by triadic closure , and following random people .
Random Browsing ( Rand ) : People have a much higher preference for following a random user who is not close in either the follower or the message flow network . “ Random ” does not necessarily imply the absence of any rule ; there can be other strategies not explored in our model , ie , following a celebrity on purpose ( similar to preferential attachment ) .
Table 2 displays the parameter averages for users in each class , representing the overall behavior pattern in that class . Users in the mixture category behave similarly to the average across all users . Fig 9 illustrates how users in different classes are mapped into the parameter space with the probability of each link creation strategy as one dimension .

6.2 Characterization of User Classes
To further differentiate users with different link creation strategies , let us look at several structural and behavioral characteristics of each class . Figs . 10(A C ) show how users in different classes create social links by comparing ptraffic , pstructure and prandom .
As shown in Fig 10(D ) , information oriented users have been active longer than users in friendship classes . Similarly , informationoriented users tend to follow more people ( Fig 10(E) ) . Informationoriented users have even more followers compared to friendshipdriven users ( Fig 10(F) ) . This suggests that they tend to be more influential , as confirmed by considering the number of times that their messages are reposted ( Fig 10(G) ) . Friendship driven users follow a few people while essentially nobody is following them . Such a passive role can be explained by their short lifetime . All of these results are consistent with Fig 4 .
Finally , Figs . 10(H I ) suggest that , while information oriented users tend to produce more messages , their role is more that of spreaders than producers of information compared to other classes . In this analysis , the parameters are fit according to the entire lifetime of each user . Focusing on the first 20 or 50 links does not yield qualitatively different results .
7 . CONCLUSION
The study of the feedback loop between the dynamics of and on the network — how the network grows and how the information spreads — offers a promising framework for understanding social influence , user behavior , and network efficiency in the context of micro blogging systems .
The results presented in this paper show that while triadic closure is the dominant mechanism for social network evolution , it is mainly relevant in the early stages of a user ’s lifetime . As time progresses , the traffic generated by the dynamics of information flow on the network becomes an indispensable component for user linking behavior . As users become more active and influential , their links create shortcuts that make the spread of information more efficient in the network . Users whose following behavior is driven by the information they see are a minority of the population , but play a key role in the information diffusion process . They produce more information , but , even more importantly , they act as spreaders of the information they collect widely across the network .
While existing link prediction algorithms [ 40 , 16 , 3 , 41 , 56 ] are not designed to explain the network evolution in a dynamic setting , the MLE framework could in principle be used to assess which link prediction methods are more consistent with the longitudinal structural changes observed in the network , by treating the prediction at each step as a link creation strategy . These approaches will be explored in future work .
We believe our findings apply generally to techno social networks , and in particular information diffusion networks and ( micro)blogs . Analyses of other micro blogging systems , such as Twitter and Weibo , would be needed to confirm this , but will be challenging due to the difficulty of obtaining full longitudinal data about user actions on the social network .

=1.0= 00()=10=10= 0.0()= 0.0()Random BrowsingMixtureInformation OrientedCasual FriendshipFrienship Figure 10 : Various features of users in different classes . The lifetime of a user is measured by how many others join the system after him . The in degree is the number of people a user is following , k , and the in degree ratio is k/(k + kout ) where kout is the number of followers . “ Reposted ” refers to the number of times that a user ’s messages are reposted by others . “ Posts ” denotes the number of messages generated by a user excluding reposts . The post ratio is the fraction of all posts by a user ( including reposts ) that are originated by that user . Each box shows data within lower and upper quartile . Whiskers represent the 99th percentile . The triangle and line in a box represent the median and mean , respectively . The grey area and the black line across the entire figure mark the interquartile range and the median of the measure across all links , respectively .
