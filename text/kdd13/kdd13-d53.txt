ABSTRACT Many people share their activities with others through online communities . These shared activities have an impact on other users’ activities . For example , users are likely to become interested in items that are adopted ( eg liked , bought and shared ) by their friends . In this paper , we propose a probabilistic model for discovering latent influence from sequences of item adoption events . An inhomogeneous Poisson process is used for modeling a sequence , in which adoption by a user triggers the subsequent adoption of the same item by other users . For modeling adoption of multiple items , we employ multiple inhomogeneous Poisson processes , which share parameters , such as influence for each user and relations between users . The proposed model can be used for finding influential users , discovering relations between users and predicting item popularity in the future . We present an efficient Bayesian inference procedure of the proposed model based on the stochastic EM algorithm . The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by using real data sets in a social bookmark sharing service .

INTRODUCTION
Many people share their activities with others through online communities , such as social sharing , social networking , and microblogging services . For example , in social sharing services , users share their favorite items , such as web pages [ 1 ] , photographs [ 2 ] , video [ 3 ] , music [ 4 ] and scientific papers [ 5 ] . These shared activities have an impact on other users’ activities . Users are likely to become interested in favorite items of their friends . A web page that is praised by an influential user in a social network service is likely to get popular .
We can obtain activity data from these online services . However , we cannot generally obtain data that directly describe which activity has had an impact on the following activities . The user interactions in some online communities have been referred to as “ ballot box communication ” [ 34 ] , in which users do not directly interact with each other by exchanging messages , but they implicitly interact with one another by expressing their preferences on the shared items . In this paper , we propose a probabilistic model for discovering latent influence between users in social communities . As activities , we consider adopting items by users over time , such as sharing web pages , voting for music and joining communities . The given data is multiple event sequences , where each event sequence is associated to an item , and contains user and timestamp information for each event of adopting the item . The proposed model can be used for finding influential users , discovering relations between users and predicting trends in item popularity in the future .
With the proposed model , we assume that each user has some latent degree of influence . Each adoption event can trigger the subsequent adoption events for the same item by other users . The possibility of triggering depends on the influence of the users of the preceding events . The proposed model also assumes that the influence differs among pairs of users . Friends can have an impact more than people who have never met . We use a cascade Poisson process [ 30 ] for modeling an event sequence of adopting an item . By using multiple cascade Poisson processes for modeling multiple event sequences and sharing their parameters , we can infer influence for each user and relations between users . We call the proposed model shared cascade Poisson processes ( SCPP ) .
We present an efficient probabilistic inference procedure for the proposed model based on the stochastic EM algorithm . In the E step , we sample the latent trigger for each event from the preceding events using collapsed Gibbs sampling while analytically integrating out parameters for influences and relations . By integrating out parameters , we can drastically reduce the memory requirement . In the M step , we estimate the other model parameters by maximizing the
266 joint likelihood . By alternately iterating E and M steps , we infer the proposed model from the given data .
The paper is organized as follows : In Section 2 , we outline related work . In Section 3 , we propose the shared cascade Poisson processes for discovering latent influence from multiple sequences of item adoption events . We present its Bayesian inference procedure in Section 4 , and discussion on scalability of the inference in Section 5 . In Section 6 , we describe a sampling procedure for generating data from the inferred model . In Section 7 , we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by using real data sets in a social bookmark sharing service . Finally , we present concluding remarks in Section 8 .
2 . RELATED WORK
Great interest is being shown in developing methods for analyzing online social communities . Those methods are used for viral marketing [ 12 , 28 , 21 , 6 ] , ranking influential users [ 31 , 18 ] and personalized recommender systems [ 32 , 11 , 19 , 7 ] . Learning degree of influence of users is useful for predicting future item adoption and recommendations [ 31 , 11 ] . However , in many social communities , users may not necessarily declare explicit social ties among themselves even if such functionality exists and the degree of influence of each tie is rarely explicitly declared . Thus , estimating influences and relations among users from their activities are important .
Influences in social communities are often analyzed by using information diffusion models , such as independent cascade models [ 13 , 35 , 15 ] and linear threshold models [ 16 ] . They usually assume discrete time although events occur in continuous time . Some information diffusion models in continuous time have been proposed [ 17 , 29 ] . The proposed model is based on Poisson processes , which are widely used for modeling events in continuous time . Poisson processes have been extensively studied in statistics , and have elegant theoretical properties , such as superposition and subsampling properties [ 22 ] . We can use these properties for developing a procedure of generating samples as described in Section 6 , and for extending the proposed model . We develop an efficient Bayesian inference procedure , where parameters are analytically integrated out . With continuous time information diffusion models [ 29 ] , influences are estimated given the network structure of users , where each edge represents the existence of influence . On the other hand , the proposed model can efficiently estimate influences without the network structure because influence parameters , which require memory of the order of the square of user size , integrated out in the Bayesian inference . In recent years , methods for estimating influences without the network structure based on maximum likelihood have been proposed [ 25 , 14 , 15 ] .
The proposed model is an extension of the cascade Poisson process [ 30 ] , which models a sequence of cascading events . We simultaneously model multiple sequences of adoption events for multiple items by sharing parameters , such as influences and relations among users . In [ 30 ] , parameters are estimated based on maximum likelihood . We take a Bayesian approach that discourages overfitting during inference . Reciprocating Hawkes Processes [ 9 ] , which are inhomogeneous Poisson processes , are used for discovering social structures from direct interaction time series data , such as message exchanges . The proposed model does not use interaction data between users , but uses item adoption event

3 . MODEL
Suppose that we have a set of |I| event sequences D = {Di}i∈I , where I is a set of items . An event sequence for item i consists of Ni events , where an event is a pair of time and user , Di = {(tin , uin)}Ni n=1 , which represents that user uin adopts item i at time tin . Without loss of generality , we can assume that events are sorted by their timestamps , tin ≤ tin′ for n < n′ . Our notation is summarized in Table 1 . An example of the data is shown in Figure 1 . Note that triggers that are shown by arrows between users are not observed .
In our model , an event can trigger further events in the future . This property is referred to as cascading , where the occurrence of an event sprouts the possibility of a chain of further events . For example , in Figure 1 , adoption of Item 1 by User A causes adoption of Item 1 by User B and UserF . In particular , we use the following intensity function for modeling the rate that user u adopts item i at time t influenced by the event that user u′ adopts item i at time t′ ,
λ(i,t′,u′)(t , u ) = αu′ θu′u exp`−γ(t − t′)´
0 if t′ < t otherwise .

Figure 2 : Parameters in the proposed shared cascade Poisson processes . all items . The second factor θu′u ≥ 0 represents the strength of the relation from user u′ to user u , where we assume
Pu∈U θu′u = 1 . This relation matrix is shared across items .
The third factor exp(−γ(t−t′ ) ) models decay of the influence over time with parameter γ ≥ 0 . Since an event cannot have an effect on past events , the intensity is zero when t′ ≥ t . A decaying rate over time is a simple but natural assumption since , in general , trends evolve or are replaced over time . There is no influence from other event sequences , and events of item i do not trigger events of other items i′ 6= i .
Events can occur without influence from preceding events according to the following background intensity function ,
λ(i,0)(t , u ) = αiθ0u .
( 2 )
Here , αi ≥ 0 represents the rate that item i is adopted without being triggered by the preceding events . It represents the general popularity of item i ; if it is high , many users adopt the item without copying or influence from peers . θ0u ≥ 0 represents the probability that a user who adopts an item without any trigger is in fact user u , andPu∈U θ0u = 1 .
In Figure 1 , User A , User E and User G adopt Item 1 independently from the preceding events . The first event for each item always occurs from the background as , by definition , there are no previous users to be influenced by . The background intensity can be seen as influence from outside the social community , such as newspapers , TV programs and online news sites as [ 26 ] .
Figure 2 shows the parameters in the proposed shared cascade Poisson processes : ( a ) relations between users , Θ = {θ}u∈U+ , θu = {θuu′ }u′∈U , ( b ) parameter of influence decay over time , γ , ( c ) influence for each user {αu}u∈U , and ( d ) popularity for each item {αi}i∈I . Here , U+ ≡ U ∪ {0} represents a set of users contain a virtual user who is used for the background intensity as well as actual users U . Notice that influence can occur in both directions amongst a pair of users eg in Figure 2 ( a ) we see that User B and User C influence each other .
Let D(n ) i be an event sequence of item i , which consists of events caused by the nth event , D(0 ) be an event sequence i ∩ D(n′ ) without triggers . They are disjoint , D(n ) = ∅ for n 6= n′ . We assume that each sequence is generated by a i i y t i s n e n t

Figure 3 shows the dynamics of intensity for each item . The horizontal line in each item represents the background intensity , which is constant over time , but different depending on the item . At the time of an event occurrence , the intensity increases depending on the influence of its user . For example , since User A has high influence , the event by UserA increases the intensity largely . The intensity decreases over time with parameter γ . The total intensity is the superposition of the background intensity and intensities from the preceding events .

INFERENCE
We present a Bayesian inference algorithm for the shared cascade Poisson processes based on a stochastic EM algorithm . The algorithm alternates collapsed Gibbs sampling of latent triggers and maximum joint likelihood estimation of hyperparameters , while integrating out parameters for influences , popularities and relations .
We introduce latent variables for simplifying the inference without changing the model . Let zin ∈ {0 , 1 , · · · , n′|tin′ < tin} be the latent index of the event which caused the arrival of the nth event in item i , where zin = 0 indicates that the event was triggered by background intensity . The trigger event must occur before the arrival of this nth event , therefore tin′ < tin , since cause precedes effect . By using latent variable z , the recursive intensity function ( 6 ) can be written as
λi(t , u ) =Xz
λi(t , u , z ) ,
( 9 )
λi(t , u , z ) = λ(i,0)(t , u )
λ(i,tiz ,uiz )(t , u ) otherwise . if z = 0
In words , ( 9 ) states that the intensity is a sum of intensities for each possible trigger of the event .

∂x By alternately iterating the E step with ( 16 ) and M step with ( 18)–(19 ) , we can estimate latent variables Z , decay parameter γ and Dirichlet parameter β . Note that because we are able to analytically integrate at all other parameters ( influences αu , item popularities αi , and the relation matrix Θ ) , there is very little risk of overfitting . The posteriors for α and Θ are given by p(αm|D , Z , a , b , γ ) = Gamma(Mm + a , Cm + b ) , p(θu|D , Z , β ) = Dirichlet(Muu′ + β ) .

( 22 )
( 23 ) which can be used for discovering relations between users . In the experiments , we fixed the hyperparameters as follows : a = b = 1 .
5 . SCALABILITY
The proposed model has relation parameters between users Θ , which require memory of O(|U |2 ) . The memory requirement increases quadratically with the number of users if we were to explicitly sample the relation parameters in our inference procedure . It makes analyzing data with a huge number of users prohibitively expensive . However , in the proposed inference procedure , we do not need to store these parameters as they are integrated out . Instead , we need to store count Muu′ for u ∈ U+ and u′ ∈ U , which represents the number of events of user u′ which were caused by user u . In general , most of the counts are zero since the count is incremented only when the two users adopt an item within a short time of one another . In addition , the Bayesian inference procedure exploits sparsity . When Mu′u > Mu′′u , the probability of selecting the event of user u′ is high , because the probability is proportional to Mu′u in ( 16 ) . The model has “ the rich gets richer ” effect . In the experiment using the ‘science’ data set with 4,543 users , which is described in Section 7 , 59,590 elements of the influence parameters have nonzero value after the inference , which make up only 13.1 elements per user . Thus , by using the proposed inference , we can analyze data with a huge number of users efficiently . The most demanding part of the inference is Gibbs sampling in the E step . The computational complexity of each Gibbs sampling ( 16 ) is O(R ) , where R is the average number of events for each item , since we have R options for each latent variable on average . In total , the computational complexity becomes O(IR2 ) . The computational time for the inference with the ‘science’ data set , which consists of activities in four years , was 12 minutes when using a computer with 3.20GHz CPU . n=1

6 . SIMULATION
By generating sequences , we can simulate when users adopt items in the future . We can generate event sequences based on the shared cascade Poisson processes given parameters and the data up to the present time . Based on Monte Carlo method , we can predict informative values , such as the number of adoptions for each item , by averaging the simulation results . The simulation can be also used for targeting users who are influential and trigger the most events , which is useful for sociology and viral marketing [ 21 , 6 ] .
Algorithm 1 shows the procedure of generating an event sequence for item i from time T to T ′ , which is based on ¸Cinlar ’s method [ 10 , 27 ] . The inputs are parameters , α , Θ , γ , and the data before T , D = {(tn , un)}N n=1 . At line 4 , an exponential random variable is sampled , which corresponds to a timestamp from a homogeneous Poisson process with rate one . At line 5 , we obtain a timestamp of the shared cascade Poisson processes by inverting the expectation function

7 . EXPERIMENTS
We evaluated the proposed shared cascade Poisson processes using large data sets collected from a social bookmark sharing service , Delicious [ 1 ] . Here , adopting an item corresponds to bookmarking a web page . The original data , described in [ 33 ] , is distributed by the authors for research purpose . We used nine data sets obtained from the original data , where each data set consist of events of adopting items that are tagged with one of nine frequently used tags . The tags and their statistics are shown in Table 2 . The sets of users and items are different depending on each data set . We omit users who appear less than 30 times in each data set . The data was collected between September 2003 to December 2007 . Since the data only contain the date on which a certain item was adopted , the timestamp in all our experiments is measured in days .
We evaluated the predictive performance using the logarithm of the likelihood for timestamps at the test period from T to T ′ , which is given by
L =Xi∈I “ −Z T ′
T Xu∈U
λi(t , u)dt ” Xt∈D test i log Xu∈U
λi(t , u ) ,
( 27 ) i where Dtest represents the test data for item i . For each data set , we prepared 10 different training and test data splits by changing the test time period from 10 to 100 days . Figure 4 shows the test likelihoods , which are averaged by the test period , T ′ − T . We compared the proposed shared cascade Poisson processes ( SCPP ) with the homogeneous Poisson processes ( PP ) . The proposed model achieved higher predictive performance than the Poisson processes with all of the data sets except for the ‘news’ data set . In general , the test likelihood decreases as the test period increases , because long term prediction is more difficult than short term prediction . Many web pages in the ‘news’ data set are adopted by influence from portal or news sites , not by influence of other users , which may explain why the Poisson processes achieved better performance .
We also evaluated the predictive performance of users by using the logarithm of the likelihood for users at the test period as follows ,
L′ =Xi∈I X(t,u)∈D test i log ¯λi(t , u ) .
( 28 )
We compared the proposed model with latent Dirichlet allocation ( LDA ) [ 8 ] , and multinomial distribution as the baseline . LDA is a widely used probabilistic model for discrete data , such as text documents , where each document consists
Figure 7 : Relations between users estimated by the proposed model in the ‘science’ data set . Each node represents a user , and users who are influenced are connected . We omit isolated users who are not connected with others . of a set of words . In our data sets , a word corresponds to a user , and a document corresponds to an event sequence of an item . Figure 5 shows the result . The proposed model achieved higher user predictive performance than the other methods with all of the data sets except for the ‘news’ data set . These results indicate that modeling influences and relations is important for analyzing social activity data sets . Figure 6 shows the event sequences in the ‘science’ data set with the estimated results of influence between events . Some events occur in a short time interval , and they were learned to have been triggered by the precedent events in the sequence . Events which occurred in isolation were estimated as being generated from the background intensity .
Figure 7 shows relations between users estimated by the proposed model in the ‘science’ data set . The relation graph is visualized using the method in [ 23 ] so that connected nodes are located closely . Most users have a small number of edges , but a few users have a lot of edges ; these would be the main influencers or most influenced depending on the direction . Some users form clusters , where users in each cluster are connected to each other , representing communities of influence . Overall the influence graph for this data set is quite sparse .
Figure 8 shows the values of influences and popularities estimated by the proposed model in the ‘science’ data set , where user and item indices were sorted by their values . Only a small number of users and items have high influence or popularity , whilst most have very small values .
8 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we have proposed a probabilistic model for discovering latent influence in social activities . Our model is based on multiple inhomogeneous Poisson processes , in which events are triggered by preceding events , and parameters are shared among the Poisson processes . We also presented its efficient Bayesian inference procedure based on the stochastic EM algorithm . We have confirmed experimentally that the proposed model can appropriately model sequences of item adoption events in social bookmark sharing data sets .
