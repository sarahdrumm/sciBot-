Abstract—Vector Space Model ( VSM ) is widely used to represent documents and web pages . It is simple and easy to deal computationally , but it also oversimplifies a document into a vector , susceptible to noise , and cannot explicitly represent underlying topics of a document . A matrix representation of document is proposed in this paper : rows represent distinct terms and columns represent cohesive segments . The matrix model views a document as a set of segments , and each segment is a probability distribution over a limited number of latent topics which can be mapped to clustering structures . The latent topic extraction based on the matrix representation of documents is formulated as a constraint optimization problem in which each matrix ( ie , a document ) Ai is factorized into a common base determined by non negative matrices L and R , and a non negative weight matrix Mi such that the sum of reconstruction error on all documents is minimized . Empirical evaluation demonstrates that it is feasible to use the matrix model for document clustering : ( 1 ) compared with vector representation , using matrix representation improves clustering quality consistently , and the proposed approach achieves a relative accuracy improvement up to 66 % on the studied datasets ; and ( 2 ) the proposed method outperforms baseline methods such as k means and NMF , and complements the state of the art methods like LDA and PLSI . Furthermore , the proposed matrix model allows more refined information retrieval at a segment level instead of at a document level , which enables the return of more relevant documents in information retrieval tasks .

I . INTRODUCTION
Document representation is fundamental for data management , information filtering , information retrieval , indexing , classification , and clustering tasks . Vector Space Model ( VSM ) represents a document as a vector of terms ( or phrases ) in which each dimension corresponds to a term ( or a phrase ) . An entry of a vector is non zero if the corresponding term ( or phrase ) occurs in the document . A significant progress has been made with vector space model in many applications . However , it has limitations due to its oversimplification of a document to a term vector . For example , long documents usually contain richer information than short ones , but long documents represented with high dimensional vectors result in calculations of document similarities that are susceptible to noise . Also one cannot explicitly represent topics in vector space model .
Documents , especially long ones , often contain multiple topics and are usually organized into one or more logically cohesive segments . A concise statement needs extra illustration or support materials to make it understandable ; relevant items are organized into sentences or paragraphs to facilitate comprehension , etc . These observations are supported by numerous examples . For example , a typical news article contains basic elements such as how , who , what , when , where , and why , and sometimes background information and the impact of the event are included . A scientific paper usually contains several sections with different emphasis . Below we show a blog post on TUAW which is related to iPad1 . The first paragraph of the post introduces an application of the iPad , followed by comments in the second paragraph , and the third paragraph is a factual statement . Apparently , each paragraph covers a specific perspective but all together are related to iPad .
Behold the power of iPad . It can charm even the most non technological of artists . This video highlights a Finnish a cappella group ( ie , a chorus that normally sings without accompaniment , creating all harmonies through voice ) who have finally gotten their hands on iPads . Here , to Madonna ’s “ Material Girl ” using iPad based instrument applications . they rock out
It ’s a lovely little video and a nice demonstration of how beautifully the iPad has evolved from a basic tablet into an artistic medium . Chorus member Jani Halme tells TUAW , “ Naturally , we shot this using iPhones . ”
The iPad debuted in Finland just a week ago .
We explore Matrix Space Model ( MSM ) to see if it can extend what Vector Space Model can achieve . Specifically , we propose to model a document as a matrix instead of a vector . The two dimensions of a matrix are terms and segments which represent logically independent parts in a document . The underlying assumption is that each ( long ) document can be divided into more than one segment with each corresponding to a few latent topics . Each segment is still represented as bag of words . Thus , Matrix Space Model is an extension of Vector Space Model . However , it
1http://wwwtuawcom/2010/12/16/found footage ipads take the acapella out of the girl group/ differs from Vector Space Model in that each document is a distribution over latent topics instead of words or phrases . The advantages of the matrix space representation are listed as follows :
• Interpretation is easier by representing a document as a set of cohesive segments , corresponding to a few topics . Some ( small ) topics will not be oblivious among the terms when a document is viewed as bag of words . This representation provides a better understanding towards documents by utilizing segmentation techniques .
• Achieving a finer granularity in data management on segments . Long documents with many terms can become obstinate results with vector space representation [ 1 ] . Indexing on cohesive segments could mitigate this phenomenon and might be able to return more specific information in terms of segments .
• Being flexible to assign more than one class label to a document as the segments within a document can be assigned with different class labels .
Clustering is an effective way to help deal with large number of documents that are being produced in various realworld applications . Document clustering has been applied to categorization , summarization , and information navigation tasks . However , classic clustering methods are designed to handle data in forms of vectors . When a document is represented as a matrix , new challenges arise for existing document clustering algorithms . We propose a new method for document clustering with matrix representation . Before we assign each document to one or more clusters ( disjoint or overlapping clustering ) , we first extract the latent topics of a corpus . The latent topic extraction is achieved by a non negative matrix approximation technique that minimizes the sum of reconstruction error on all documents . Segments , instead of documents , with similar distributions over latent topics naturally form clusters . The document could be assigned a most probable label based on the segment labels , or we obtain overlapping clustering by treating each segment label as one of the corresponding document labels .
Document Modeling in a Graphic Interpretation The proposed procedure is illustrated in Figure 1 . A document di contains multiple segments ( s1 , s2 , . . . , sc ) ; each segment is a probabilistic distribution over l latent topics ( t1 , t2 , . . . , tl ) ; and finally latent topics are mapped to k clusters ( c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ) via clustering algorithms . To the best of our knowledge , this model is different from other data representation of documents . Segmentation is a well established realm , thus is not the focus of this work . A major task of this work is to estimate the probabilities between segments and latent topics ( topic extraction as shown in Figure 1 ) .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . We define the problem formally in Section II , followed by the topic extraction in Section III . We build a connection between the
Figure 1 . Graph Interpretation proposed approach with Non negative Matrix Factorization ( NMF ) techniques in Section IV . Empirical evaluation is presented in Section V with discussion . We summarize the related work in Section VI . The research is concluded in Section VII with some future work .
II . PROBLEM FORMULATION
The studied problem is divided into three components : matrix representation , latent topic extraction , and clustering . Firstly , we represent documents as matrices leveraging well established segmentation techniques . Let D = {d1 , d2 , . . . , dn} be a corpus with n documents , Thus , a document di is denoted as a matrix Ai ∈ Rr×c ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n ) , where r and c correspond to the numbers of terms and segments of the corpus . It is also possible to obtain an arbitrary number of segments for different documents , eg , longer documents could have more segments than short documents . We encode matrices Ai by TF IDF weighting such that matrices Ai are non negative , ie , Ai ≥ 0 .
Secondly , the latent topic extraction is accomplished by a matrix approximation method . Given two user specified parameters 1 and 2 ( The smallest reconstruction error is obtained when 1 = 2 ) , we want to compute two non negative basis matrices L ∈ Rr×1 ( L ≥ 0 ) and R ∈ Rc×2(R ≥ 0 ) , and non negative matrices Mi ∈ R1×2 ( Mi ≥ 0 ) , such that LMiR is a good approximation for matrix Ai . Computing optimal matrices L , R , and Mi can be formulated as follows , n i=1
Ai − LMiR2 F ,
( 1 ) min
L ∈ Rr×1 R ∈ Rc×2 Mi ∈ R1×2
: L ≥ 0 : R ≥ 0 : Mi ≥ 0 where · F represents the Frobenius norm of a matrix . We can interpret non negative matrices L and R as jointly defining a lower dimensional space ( if 1 and 2 are smaller than r and c ) , and each Mi is the low rank representation of dis1s2sc…c1ck…t1t2tl…SegmentationTopic ExtractionCluster Mapping the original matrices . Specifically , in the case of document clustering , Ai represents the i th document , matrices L and R define the latent topic space for all data points , and Mi is the mixture weights of a document over all latent topics . Since L and R are common for all matrices , two documents that are similar in the original space are expected to be similar in the lower dimensional space . For each document di , LMi represents the posterior probability distribution of each term in a document belonging to latent topics , and MiR represents the posterior probability distribution of each segment in a document belonging to latent topics .
The above formulation takes a similar form of Singular Value Decomposition ( SVD ) except that matrices L , Mi and R are non negative and Mi are usually not diagonal . And it is a generalization of Non Negative Matrix Factorization ( NMF ) because L or R are usually not identity matrices . The relation between our formulation and Non negative Matrix Factorization ( NMF ) will be further discussed in Section IV . Thirdly , we obtain document clustering by creating a mapping from the latent topics to clusters via any clustering algorithms ( in this paper , we adopt k means ) . As an alternative , it is also possible to treat each topic as a cluster if the number of latent topics is equal to the number of clusters k . In the scope of the paper , we use the first strategy under the assumption that several latent topics could be semantically close thus belong to one cluster . Let ˜dij be the probability distribution of j th column of i th document over latent topics , there are two ways to assign documents to clusters : 1 ) obtain disjoint clustering by applying k means to documents . 2 ) obtaining overlapping clustering by applying k means to segments directly . They can be formulated as follows , i ij min k min where ˜di· = k j
˜dij represents the probability distribution of a document over latent topics , and centroid(c ) represents the centroid of cluster c .
Segmentation and cluster mapping can be obtained by well established methods . Thus , the problem boils down to solving latent topic extraction via Non negative Matrix Approximation ( NMA ) .
III . LATENT TOPIC EXTRACTION
We propose to solve the problem defined in Eq ( 1 ) by an alternating least square approach . It should be noted that matrix factorization problems are usually not convex , thus there are no guarantees to find optimal solutions . We investigate how to obtain a local optimal solution , and by running multiple times with different initializations , aiming to achieve one close to the optimal solution in practice . We solve the problem in two steps . We first define nonnegative auxillary matrices Bi(1 ≤ i ≤ n ) , such that each

( 2 )
Ai can be factorized as follows ,
Ai = LBi , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n .
( 3 )
Then , in the second step , each matrix Bi is further factorized into two matrices Mi and R which can be shown by ,
Bi = MiR , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n .
( 4 )
Both sub problems defined in Eq ( 3 ) and Eq ( 4 ) are nonconvex but can be solved by an alternating scheme : for Eq ( 3 ) , we first fix L and compute Bi , then update L by fixing all matrices Bi . The procedure is repeated until convergence . The same procedure can be applied to Eq ( 4 ) . Fix L , compute Bi . When L is fixed , Bi can be computed by solving a series of non negative least square problems . i be the l th columns of matrices Ai Specifically , let al and Bi , respectively . Then bl i can be computed by solving the following non negative least square problem , i and bl

Finally , we obtain the following two sided approximations for the original matrices Ai which can be shown as ,
Ai ≈ LMiR , i = 1 , 2 , . . . , n ,
( 14 ) where matrices L , Mi , and R are all non negative . Above procedures are summarized in Algorithm ( 1 ) .
Given a dataset with n instances , we need to solve nc and r non negative least square problems for computing Eq ( 5 ) and Eq ( 12 ) , respectively . Similarly , we need n1 and c non negative least square problems to solve for computing Eq ( 13 ) , respectively . Thus , the computational complexity of Algorithm ( 1 ) is O ( k1(nc + r ) + k2(n1 + c) ) , where k1 and k2 are the number of iterations for solving Eq ( 3 ) and Eq ( 4 ) , respectively .
IV . CONNECTION TO NON NEGATIVE MATRIX
FACTORIZATION ( NMF )
From the perspective of matrix factorization , we obtain a two sided non negative matrix factorization via NMA . Thus , it is a special form of Non negative Matrix Factorization . For simplicity , let Zi = Ai − LMiR ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n ) . We can rewrite Eq ( 1 ) as follows ,

The matrices A , L , M , and R are given as follows ,

Apparently , matrices L , M and R are all nonnegative . Although Eq ( 15 ) takes the same form of TriFactorization [ 2 ] , the difference between NMA and NMF are summarized below ,
• Representations are different . Each document is a represented as a matrix in Eq ( 1 ) , however , for Non negative Matrix Factorization each document is represented as a vector . • L and R are block diagonal matrices but not for Non negative Matrix Factorization .

626 495 385 distributed to 19 clusters . Another important observation of the dataset is that some of the clusters share a large number of keywords .
Reuters 215783 is a testbed for clustering purposes since the labels are manually specified . We remove the short documents with less than 1,000 characters . Documents with multiple labels are also excluded . Finally 1,964 documents are obtained and distributed in 26 clusters . The maximum , mean , and minimum cluster have 471 , 71 , and 12 documents , respectively . This dataset is highly unbalanced in terms of document distribution in clusters .
Classic4 is a text corpus on scientific papers . It has 1,400 Cranfield documents from aeronautical system papers , 1,033 medline documents from medical journals , and 1,460 cisi documents from information retrieval papers . Documents less than 1,000 characters are removed and finally we get a dataset with 1,486 documents .
The datasets are preprocessed to remove stop words , stem terms by the Porter Stemming algorithm , and terms are then weighted by TF IDF weighting scheme . Different text segmentation techniques can be applied to extract segments from documents . The linear text segmentation by Choi et al . [ 4 ] is used in our experiments because the studied documents are not very long , thus it is more appropriate to segment based on sentences , and technically , any segmentation approach can be applied to extract segments . We do not attempt to propose a new segmentation algorithm , nor do we attempt to compare which segmentation approach is superior in the rest of the paper .
Short documents with less than 1,000 characters including space , stop words and etc are excluded based on two observations : short documents contain too few terms after removing stop words , spaces , header and footer , eg , some documents may have few words or blank at all , thus these extremely short documents might become less meaningful for clustering tasks ; short documents containing too few sentences are difficult to be divided into meaningful segments . The segmentation algorithms are typically running clustering algorithms at different resolutions such as sentence , paragraph . Thus , the documents should not be too short

V . EMPIRICAL EVALUATION
We will introduce the datasets used in experiments , examine how clustering accuracy is affected by varying the number of latent topics and the number of segments in a document , demonstrate the advantages of adopting a matrix representation , and compare the proposed NMA approach with representative document clustering methods to understand their pros and cons .
A . The Effect of 1/2
Theoretical analysis on matrix approximation shows that the sum of reconstruction error is minimized [ 3 ] when 1 ≈ 2 . In the case of non negative matrix approximation , we verify the theoretic result using a synthetic dataset . It consists of 500 matrices with dimensions 100 by 100 and the entries of the matrices being between 0 and 255 . The purpose is to show the reconstruction error with respect to dimensions 1 and 2 of matrices Mi . The sum of reconstruction error is defined as follows , n
SRE =
Ai − LMiR2
F
( 17 ) i=1 this phenomenon is verified on the dataset . We fix the summation of 1 and 2 to 100 . As shown in Figure 2 , the minimum reconstruction error is achieved when 1 ≈ 2 . Thus , in the following experiments , we set 1 = 2 = , where is called the number of latent topics .
B . Text Corpus Introduction
Three widely used real text corpora are used to evaluate the performance of NMA with four representative document clustering methods .
20Newsgroup2 is a collection of documents across 20 different newsgroups . It contains 19,997 documents that are roughly , evenly distributed in 20 groups . Short documents with less than 1,000 characters are removed from the dataset , resulting in 6,038 documents distributed in 20 groups . The maximum , mean , and minimum groups have 506 , 301 , and 27 documents , respectively . Except for one small cluster with 27 instances , other documents are roughly evenly

Finally , the average numbers of words in the three datasets 20Newsgroup , Reuters 21578 , and Classic are 113 , 97 , and 108 , respectively . In the following experiments , we use k(2 ≤ k ≤ 5 ) and to denote the number of clusters and the number of latent topics , respectively . Given a cluster number k , the number of latent topics is set to at least k ( ie , ≥ k ) . Experiments with different k and values are extensively carried out . Given the number of clusters k , the number of latent topics , and a dataset D , we evaluate the proposed clustering algorithms in the following three steps ,
• Dataset Generation : we randomly select k classes with the documents belonging to the k classes from dataset D to form a new dataset Dk which is a subset of D , • Evaluation : we run the proposed clustering algorithm or other baseline algorithms 10 times with different initializations on Dk by setting the number of clusters to k , then obtain the mean accuracy , and
• Repeat : we repeat above steps 50 times and report the mean accuracy for pre specified parameters k and .
We apply the exact same procedures on the baseline methods which will be introduced next since clustering algorithms such as k means and NMF typically converge to local minima . We do not perform clustering on the whole dataset but on the datasets we constructed that are subsets of the whole dataset .
C . Baseline Methods and Metric
We compare our methods to four methods for document clustering . K means is to partition n documents into disjoint k clusters such that the inter cluster similarity is minimized , meanwhile the inner cluster similarity is maximized . Kmeans usually converges to local minima . Non negative Matrix Factorization ( NMF ) has recently been successfully applied to document clustering [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] . It computes the probability of each document belonging to each cluster and a document is assigned to the cluster with maximum probability . Similar to k means , the cluster assignment is usually not optimal . Topic models such as Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing ( PLSI ) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) have been used to infer clusters .
We evaluate the clustering quality by accuracy on a real text corpus . Given a clustering , the label of each cluster is determined by the class that dominates this cluster . Denoting l(c ) as the label of a cluster c , l(dj ) as the predicted label of the j th document , the accuracy is defined as follows , k c dj∈c
ACC =
1 n
δ(l(dj ) , l(c ) )
( 18 )
D . Latent Topics vs Clustering Quality
In practice , the number of latent topics should be bounded by a limited number in a corpus . Fixing the number of clusters k from 2 to 5 , we set the number of latent topics
Figure 3 . Clustering Quality wrt the Number of Latent Topics ( k=2 )
Figure 4 . Clustering Quality wrt the Number of Latent Topics ( k=3 ) from k to ( 3k + 3 ) with an increment of 1 . For example , when k is set to 2 , the latent topics are set to between 2 and 9 . Then the average accuracy on 50 runs for each dataset is reported in Figures 3—6 . As shown in these figures , the accuracy gets improved as the number of latent topics increases . For example , the average relative improvements are 17.7 % , 9.75 % , 22.0 % when the number of latent topics are set to at least k + 1 on the Newsgroup , Reuters , and Classic datasets , respectively .
We also observe another pattern : the accuracy is improved acutely when the latent topics are increased at the first few steps ( ie l = k + 1 or l = k + 2 ) , then the improvement becomes flat . When the number of latent topics is set to number of clusters , the performance is not as good as that when a larger number of latent topics is used .
E . Matrix Representation vs Vector Representation
The number of segments controls the granularity in modeling a document . Since the studied datasets are not very long , the number of segments are set to between 1 to 6 , recalling that a document is represented as a vector when the number of segments is set to 1 . To fare to compare , we fix the number of the latent topics and number of clusters but vary the number of segments . The results are reported in Figure 7—10 , in which the x axis represents the number of segments , and y axis represents the mean accuracy . The four figures correspond to datasets constructed with different numbers of classes , ie , we construct datasets with 2 , 3 , 4 ,

Figure 6 . Clustering Quality wrt the Number of Latent Topics ( k=5 ) and 5 clusters , respectively . The accuracy is averaged on 50 randomly constructed datasets with different initializations , thus it is an decent indicator that reflects how the number of segments affect the clustering quality .
In each figure , the first column represents the utilizing vector representation , while the other columns represent matrix representation . They consistently show that utilizing multiple segments outperforms single segment . We achieve a relative improvement up to 66 % on Newsgroup dataset when k and are set to 4 and 3 ( Figure 9 ) , respectively . We also observe another interesting pattern : the improvement peaks when the number of segments is set to 2 or 3 for the studied datasets , then drops a little when a document is spit into more segments . This is partly because the studied documents are rather short thus splitting a document into more segments makes the segments too small to be meaningful . However , this is helpful in practice for selecting the number of segments .
In Table II , we summarize the relative improvement in

In the table , each entry represents the relative improvement that are averaged on the number of segments ranging from 2 to 6 in the experiments . This table essentially shows the superiority of the matrix presentation over the vector representation of documents.Since Classic dataset only contains 3 classes , two of the corresponding entries are vacant . Although the improvement varies with respect to the number of classes selected , we achieve consistent improvement by applying matrix representation .
Currently , we assign a unique number of segments to all documents in a dataset , but documents in different lengths deserve to be treated differently . For instance , in general , longer documents could be split into more segments and shorter documents might have fewer segments . This study could be interesting and will be exploited as future work .

Each entry of the three tables represents the accuracy of the proposed approach and baseline methods that is averaged on 50 randomly generated datasets with the number of classes k pre specified .
On the Newsgroup dataset ( Table III ) , the proposed method is comparable to the two state of the art methods LDA and PLSI . Compared to k means and NMF , NMA gains 71.9 % and 45.1 % relative improvements , respectively . We noticed that the classes in Newsgroup have relatively large numbers of documents , probabilistic models such as LDA and PLSI which utilize the co occurrence of terms are capable of learning more accurate models than k means and NMF . It seems that other methods are more susceptible to be affected than LDA by the number of clusters in the datasets . The performance on the Reuters dataset is summarized in Table IV : k means performs the worst in all cases , NMF , PLSI , and LDA are close , while NMA method outperforms other methods , especially when the k is set to 2 and 3 . On average , NMA gains 20.42 % , 7.46 % , 18.52 % , and 10.37 % improvement in accuracy compared with k means , NMF , PLSI , and LDA , respectively . We notice that for this dataset , the average cluster size is relatively small and the size of a cluster varies significantly as seen in Table I .
As shown in Table V on the Classic dataset , NMA and LDA are comparable , and PLSI follows very close .
ACCURACY PERFORMANCE ON REUTERS
Table IV k means 77.68 70.37 75.96 73.85
NMF 86.68 81.75 82.25 83.09
PLSI 79.08 72.49 77.27 73.78
LDA 83.33 80.95 81.57 79.11
NMA 94.47 91.32 86.95 85.94
ACCURACY PERFORMANCE ON CLASSIC
Table V k means 76.71 77.26
NMF 87.88 86.29
PLSI 97.49 96.60
LDA 97.78 97.57
NMA 98.36 96.45 k 2 3 4 5 k 2 3
Compared to the other two datasets , the clusters are larger in size and more balanced , and the clusters are very different in content as the documents are from different fields . LDA and PLSI are capable of learning the cluster structure accurately when the corpus is large and cluster boundaries are clear . The performance of NMA is relatively stable .
G . Further Discussions
Compared to Vector Space Model , the advantages of Matrix Space Representation of documents can be summarized as follows : gaining a finer granularity ( segments instead of documents ) in information retrieval tasks , helping interpret documents topics , and providing quality document clusterings . However , it also comes with some limitations : storing a matrix requires more space , computing latent topics is not as efficient by matrix approximation as using vectors . But it should also be noticed that since the matrix representation is more sparse than the vector representation ( each segment contains fewer terms ) , the sparsity property can be utilized to improve computational efficiency .
The consistent improvement in accuracy performance by utilizing the matrix representation versus the vector representation demonstrates the superiority of the new data representation though there is a cost to do that . We demonstrate that it is not only feasible but also more preferable to encode documents as matrices instead of vectors . Though this paper use clustering to illustrate the power of the matrix representation , it is also intriguing to examine whether it is worth adapting the matrix representation in other applications such as classification and information retrieval .
VI . RELATED WORK
Document clustering is useful in data management , information retrieval , filtering , and navigation . It is related to several key components : document representation , segmentation , topic models , and clustering algorithms . Next we summarize each component separately .
A . Document Representation
The Vector Space Model ( VSM ) is widely used in text and web mining , information filtering , information retrieval , etc . It views a document as a bag of words or phrases which assumes the independence between different terms and ignores the order of the terms in a document . Some extensions of the Vector Space Model are focused on feature construction . For example , combining terms into syntactic phrases [ 7 ] , using anchor texts to enrich document representation [ 8 ] , extracting name entities [ 9 ] , and constructing bag of phrases [ 10 ] as new features . However , the VSM representation of documents has some limitations : 1 ) document similarity is susceptible to noise because of high dimensionality ; 2 ) topics within a document are hidden behind bag of words thus is not intuitive to interpret . 3 ) obstinate results may hurt user satisfaction in information retrieval applications [ 1 ] .
Liu et al . propose to represent documents as tensors [ 11 ] . All terms including special characters within a document are split into consecutive equal sized substrings , then each character in a substring represents a dimension of the tensors . For example , if the substring length is 3 , then a document is represented by a tensor T 27×27×27 . Apparently , this model is not storage efficient and substrings are usually invalid words or in even worse cases the semantic meaning of a word could be totally changed if a substring refers to another word .
B . Document Segmentation
Text segmentation is to divide text into multiple meaningful units which is termed as “ segments ” in this paper . It is a well established area and there are efficient and sophisticated methods for segmentation which is not the focus of this work . Each segment is a relatively cohesive component within a document . Segmentation approaches can be based on words , sentences , or paragraphs . The simplest way of segmentation is to divide a document into several roughly equal sized components thus is based on words . Choi et al . [ 4 ] propose to extract text segmentation based on sentence similarity and the boundary of segments are determined by divisive clustering algorithms . Tagarelli et al . [ 12 ] divides the documents into segments based on clustering on paragraphs . This method works for long documents .
C . Topic Models
Topic models assume a document consists of one or more topics which can be treated as clusters . Hofmann et al . [ 13 ] proposed Probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing ( PLSI ) , which models each word in a document as a sample from a mixture model , where the mixture components are multinomial random variables that can be viewed as representations of “ topics ” . Thus each word is generated from a single topic and different words in a document may be generated from different topics . Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) [ 14 ] , which is also extended from Latent Semantic Indexing ( LSI ) , is currently considered as the state of the art method in text clustering . LDA assumes that each document is a mixture of a small number of topics and that each word ’s creation is attributed to one of the document ’s topics . Although both PLSI and LDA view words and documents as mixture of topics , they ignore word order .
D . Document Clustering
Text clustering has a broad application in topic extraction , information retrieval , information filtering , etc . Most popular document clustering approaches are based on the Vector Space Model . Clustering techniques can be roughly divided into two categories : discriminative and generative . The discriminative algorithms optimize an object function to produce an pseudo optimal clustering ; whereas , the generative algorithms assumes that the data can be modeled by an underlying distribution such that the parameters of a model could be learned iteratively [ 15 ] . Instead of clustering documents , co clustering which is related to spectral clustering [ 16 ] attempts to clustering the documents and words simultaneously [ 17 ] .
E . Non negative Matrix Factorization
Non negative Matrix Factorization ( NMF ) is a technique for co clustering the rows and columns of a matrix . It has been applied in document clustering tasks . The basic idea is to find non negative matrices W and H , such that their product is an approximation of the original matrix X , ie X = W H . If X is a term document matrix , matrices W and H can be interpreted as a cluster structure and memberships of a document belong to each cluster , respectively . The rank of matrices W and H are often smaller than that of X . Thus , W and H can be thought of as a compressed form for matrix X . However , the factorization of matrices are usually not unique , and the solvers can be roughly classified into three categories : Multiplicative Update Methods [ 18 ] , Gradient Descendent Methods [ 19 ] , [ 5 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 21 ] , and Alternating Least Squares Methods [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] . The different NMF techniques and their relationships with other clustering techniques are summarized by Li and Ding [ 24 ] .
VII . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper , we propose to represent a document as a matrix in which the two dimensions are terms and segments . A document is then modeled as follows : a document is a set of segments and a segment is a mixture over a limited number of latent topics . Documents are assigned to a cluster if they have similar probability distributions on latent topics . Experimental evaluations show that 1 ) it is feasible to use the matrix space model for document clustering and we achieve consistent improvement in terms of accuracy when compared with vector representation , 2 ) the proposed document clustering approach outperforms baseline methods such as k means and NMF , and 3 ) the matrix representation complements the vector representation in handling different types of data .
This work also suggests some promising research opportunities . One direction is to examine how precision and recall vary by indexing segments instead of documents in information retrieval . The practical significance of this extension is that we enable the return of relevant segments in a document . Another direction is to adapt existing document clustering methods to accept matrix space representation of documents as input to explore expanded capabilities of document clustering .
