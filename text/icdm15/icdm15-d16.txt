Abstract—Based on the definition of local spectral subspace , we propose a novel approach called LOSP for local overlapping community detection . Using the power method for a few steps , LOSP finds an approximate invariant subspace , which depicts the embedding of the local neighborhood structure around the seeds of interest . LOSP then identifies the local community expanded from the given seeds by seeking a sparse indicator vector in the subspace where the seeds are in its support .
We provide a systematic investigation on LOSP , and thoroughly evaluate it on large real world networks across multiple domains . With the prior information of very few seed members , LOSP can detect the remaining members of a target community with high accuracy . Experiments demonstrate that LOSP outperforms the Heat Kernel and PageRank diffusions . Using LOSP as a subroutine , we further address the problem of multiple membership identification , which aims to find all the communities a single vertex belongs to . High F1 scores are achieved in detecting multiple local communities with respect to arbitrary single seed for various large real world networks .
INTRODUCTION
I . there has been a growing interest
In recent years , in finding the local community structure in large networks [ 8]– [ 10 ] , [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] . Several seed set expansion based approaches have been demonstrated to be effective in identifying local community [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 15 ] . Starting from a few members shared by some domain expert , these algorithms attempt to uncover the remaining latent members . These known members are usually referred to as seeds in the literature , and the process of gradually growing the seed set into a larger set until the target community is revealed is called seed set expansion .
Seed set expansion can be applied to many real world scenarios . For instance , in political participation networks , one might discover a large political group from a small set of representative politicians [ 5 ] . In product co purchase networks , sales websites may recommend potential products to the customer by expanding from a few purchased products . In biological networks representing the interactions among genes , biologists are likely to discover a set of genes that form a functionally similar unit starting from a few observed and wellstudied genes .
Variants of random walk techniques have been extensively adopted as a subroutine for conducting seed set expansion [ 2 ] , which can be seen as a localized graph diffusion process where the probability is distributed from the initial seeds to the surroundings . Most commonly seen approaches can be categorized into two types – PageRank like diffusion [ 1 ] , [ 9 ] ,
[ 17 ] , and Heat Kernel graph diffusion [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] – both of which will be discussed in detail below .
Spielman and Teng [ 13 ] use degree normalized , personalized PageRank ( DN PageRank ) with respect to the start seed and truncate on small PageRank probability values , leading to the PageRank Nibble method [ 1 ] . The DN PageRank is adopted by several other PageRank based clustering algorithms [ 2 ] , [ 17 ] , which are competitive with the METIS algorithm [ 7 ] . Kloumann and Kleinberg [ 9 ] evaluate different variations of PageRank , and find that the standard PageRank yields better performance than the DN PageRank .
The Heat Kernel method is another type of graph diffusion technique [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 8 ] . It involves the Taylor series expansion of the matrix exponential of the random walk transition matrix . Chung et al . analyze the property of this diffusion theoretically [ 3 ] , and propose a randomized Monte Carlo method to estimate the diffusion [ 4 ] . Kloster et al . [ 8 ] propose a deterministic method that uses coordinate relaxation on an implicit linear system that estimates the Heat Kernel diffusion , and show that Heat Kernel outperforms the personalized PageRank with substantially higher F1 measures .
A stopping criterion for defining the community boundary is necessary for all seed set expansion methods , unless the size of the target community is known as a budget . Conductance has become a widely adopted metric in determining the boundary of a community [ 8 ] , [ 15 ] , [ 17 ] . For example , Yang and Leskovec [ 17 ] provide widely used real world datasets with labeled ground truth , and find that conductance and triadpartition ratio ( TPR ) are the two stopping rules yielding the highest accuracy . The Heat Kernel method [ 8 ] also adopts conductance as the stopping criterion for the local community . Despite the success of many random walk based approaches which rely on the single probability vector after short random walks , very few have utilized the subspace formed by the random walk diffusion . Based on our previous investigation on local spectral clustering [ 10 ] , we provide a systematic approach for finding small , overlapping communities using the subspace shaped by the dynamics of short random walks , which we call LOSP ( Local Spectral ) .
We first address problems concerning the local structure in large networks : How do we find a local community in time that is a function of the size of the target community rather than the size of the entire network ? What constitutes a good stopping criterion when growing the seed set into a local community ? How do the quality and quantity of the seed members affect the performance of LOSP ? We also consider LOSP when the domain expert poorly selects the initial seed members .
We then tackle the problem of identifying all the communities a single vertex is in , which we refer to as the multiple membership identification problem . Identifying all local communities is useful in numerous applications . For instance , social network users may be interested in exploring all social groups an individual is in , and biologists would like to mine all GO ( Gene Ontology ) terms a gene serves .
LOSP is based on the classical spectral clustering method , which starts with computing the first d eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian or some matrix associated with the network . Each row in the eigenvector matrix corresponds to the embedding of a vertex in a d dimensional space . These vectors are then clustered using k means , resulting in disjoint communities . We make two fundamental changes :
1 ) Define the local spectral subspace . We calculate the first few eigenvectors by the power method , but instead of iterating to convergence , we iterate for a few steps such that the probability distribution of a random walk starting from the seeds reaches the local community but does not spread to the entire graph .
2 ) Handle the overlapping situation . Instead of clustering the row vectors in the d dimensional subspace , we seek a minimum 1 norm indicator vector in the local spectral subspace where the initial seeds are in its support . Overlapping communities correspond to different seed sets .
We thoroughly analyze variations of LOSP and explain the intuition behind the method . Five community scoring functions are evaluated , including our newly proposed definitions of triad participation number ( TPN ) and normalized modularity . LOSP is robust with little fluctuations under different scoring functions , where conductance and TPN yield the best performance . We also investigate the structural properties of different seed sets , and find that low degree seeds and random seeds are essentially the same for real world networks in finding the local structure . The performance evaluation on various real world networks shows that LOSP outperforms the prevalent PageRank and Heat Kernel diffusion methods , and serves as a good subroutine for multiple membership identification .
II . PRELIMINARIES
A . Problem Statement
Let G = ( V , E ) be a connected , undirected graph with n vertices and m edges , and let C be a set of labeled communities . We address two basic questions : ( 1 ) Given a few exemplary members S in a target community Ck ∈ C where |Ck| n , how to identify the remaining latent members in Ck ? ( 2 ) How can we identify all the communities a single seed s belongs to ?
B . Community Scoring Functions
To mathematically characterize a community like subset of vertices , we adopt three commonly used scoring functions , modularity ( Mod ) , conductance ( Cond ) and triad participationratio ( TPR ) . Additionally , we propose two new scoring functions , normalized modularity ( nMod ) and triad participationnumber ( TPN ) .
Let c be the number of communities . Let nk and ekk be the number of vertices and edges within a community Ck , and dk be the total degree of the internal vertices . The modularity [ 11 ] Qk of a community Ck is Qk = ekk m − , dk
2 .
2m
Instead of using “ minus ” to define the modularity , we use “ divide ” to define the normalized modularity D . Since the coefficient 4m is a constant when evaluating in the same network , we simply define Dk = ekk , which is insensitive d2 k to the network scale . We let Dk = 0 when there is only one isolated vertex in Ck .
Conductance measures the fraction of edges leaving the community [ 12 ] . When the community contains less than half the total edges in the network , the conductance of a community Ck is defined by Φk = dk−2ekk
= 1 − 2 ekk
. dk dk
Triad Participation Ratio ( TPR ) is the fraction of vertices in the community that belong to triads [ 17 ] . Based on TPR , we define another scoring function Triad Participation Number ( TPN ) as the average number of triads a vertex belongs to . TPR and TPN are based on the internal connectivity , while modularity , normalized modularity and conductance are based on both the internal and external connectivity .
C . Datasets
We consider five real world network datasets available from the SNAP website1.For each network , we adopt the top 5000 annotated communities with the highest quality evaluated with several metrics by Yang & Leskovec [ 17 ] . Table 1 summarizes the statistics on the datasets and the ground truth communities ( D90 % indicates 90 percentile effective diameter ) .

A . Defining the Local Spectral Subspace
Consider a short random walk starting from the known seed members . We approximate the first d eigenvectors to characterize the embedding of the local network structure surrounding the seeds .
Let p(t ) be a column vector specifying the probability mass of each vertex at step t . We define a basis for a local approximately invariant subspace as follows :
1 )
2 )
3 )
The initial probability p(1 ) is assigned by evenly distributing the probability among the seed members . Conduct d − 1 steps of the random walk NT rwp(t ) = p(t+1 ) to get the span of d successive probability vectors . Find their orthonormal basis V(0 ) d , the initial invariant subspace approximation :
V(0 ) d = orth([p(1 ) , p(2 ) , , p(d)] ) .
Compute the orthonormal basis V(k ) iteration : rwV(k−1 ) d = orth(NT
V(k ) d
) . d by the subspace
Here d and k are some modest parameters empirically determined in Section 43 The orthonormal basis V(k ) d is what we call the local spectral basis and the subspace spanned by the basis is called the local spectral subspace . B . Finding Local Overlapping Communities
With the local spectral basis V(k ) d , we look for row vectors in the subspace that are nearly in the same direction as the seeds . More precisely , we solve the following linear programming problem LP1 : n
|y|1 = min yi d x , ( 2 ) y ≥ 0 , ( 3 ) sT y ≥ 1 . st ( 1 ) ∃x st y = V(k ) i=1 x d ,−I ]
Constraint ( 1 ) requires y be in the span of V(k ) d , and can be rewritten as [ V(k ) = 0 . Constraint ( 2 ) requires y ≥ 0 where yi indicates the likelihood that vertex i belongs to the target community . Constraint ( 3 ) enforces that the seeds be in the support of sparse vector y where s is an indicator vector for the seed set . y
We solve LP1 and sort vertices according to their random walk probability scores in y in decreasing order . Then we select the top ˆn vertices with the highest probabilities as the resulting community . One could simply select the top |C| vertices if the size of the target community C is known as a budget , or use heuristics provided in Section 4.3 to determine ˆn automatically .
C . An Alternative Definition of the Local Spectral Subspace An alternative way to define the local spectral subspace is to use the normalized adjacency matrix Nsym instead of Nrw . As Nsym is symmetric , the two matrices share the same set of real eigenvalues , with the eigenvectors of Nsym scaled by D1/2 . Note that ( NT sym)k = D−1/2(NT rw)kD1/2 , and
( NT sym)kD−1/2p(1 ) = D−1/2(NT rw)kp(1 ) for an initial probability p(1 ) . Thus the sequence of vectors generated with the random walk matrix is closely related to the sequence generated by the symmetrized matrix .
We know π where πi = di/2m indicates the stationary rwπ = π . As probability for the transition matrix Nrw , ie NT symD−1/2π = D−1/2NT NT rwπ = D−1/2π , in the alternative definition of local spectral subspace , we desympt ) , which fined another random walk by pt+1 = norm(NT di √ converges to the stationary distribution π where π .
√ i = di
IV . THE PROPOSED ALGORITHM
The entire local spectral ( LOSP ) algorithm consists of several procedures that we describe in detail below .
A . Local Sampling
The 90 percentile effective diameter D90 % in Table 1 shows that there is a small world phenomenon for most vertices . We apply a local sampling by breadth first search ( BFS ) to get a small subgraph covering most of the neighborhood vertices .
For each vertex in the seed set S , we first conduct a 2 step BFS ( 3 step BFS on Amazon due to its larger D90% ) . Consider the set of the frontier vertices , and remove vertices whose outdegree is greater than 1000 . Sort the remainder vertices in decreasing order according to their inward ratio ( the fraction of inward edges to the BFS subgraph ) , and remove vertices after the first 1000 . Then union the BFS subgraphs obtained from each seed .
For a set S with three random seeds , we generally produce a sampling subgraph of size thousands . The coverage ratio , defined as the fraction of ground truth vertices covered by the sampled network , can reach 90 % to 99 % , except on Orkut , where the ground truth communities are much larger .
The subnetwork is extracted in time Θ(dr avg|S| ) , where r is the number of BFS levels , davg is the average degree of the component , and |S| is the initial number of seeds . As subsequent steps apply only to the sampled network , the complexity is reduced to time polynomial in the size of the sampled network .
B . Strengthen the Initial Seed Set
Larger seed sets can improve accuracy [ 9 ] , but often few seeds are available . To compensate for the shortage of seeds , we provide a method to strengthen the initial seed set : find a shortest path for each pair of vertices , and add vertices on the path to the initial seed set if the length is no greater than a small number l . The intuition is that any two seeds in the same community must be related for some reason . They connect with each other either via a direct link or via some other intermediate vertices . In the latter case , those intermediate vertices bridging the seeds are very likely to be in the target community because they serve as the relational “ relay ” in order for the seeds to be in the same community . The shorter the path is , the more likely they are in the same community . We experimented with several values of l including l = 1 , and find that l = 4 generally yields the best results overall datasets .
C . Initial Membership Identification
We use the strengthened initial seed set S as the input to the linear programming problem LP1 to find an initial community . Three key parameters need to be determined .
Dimension of the subspace d . We observe that d is related to the number of local structures around the seeds . We calculate the overlapping membership om , the number of communities a vertex is in , for vertices belonging to at least one ground truth . om is as low as 1.2 for DBLP and is around 1.5 for other datasets . As there may be some other local structures out of the annotation , we choose d = 3 , assuming there are three local structures on average . Our experiments also show that d = 3 yields the full potential .
Steps of the random walk k . k is related to the size and conductance of the target community . A larger or sparser community usually needs more steps to spread the information , and the lower conductance serves as a better bottleneck to prevent probability from leaking out . Experiments show the detection accuracy plateaus as k increases and k = 3 yields the full potential .
Boundary of the local community . As the global minimum of scoring functions might produce “ cavemen type ” communities [ 6 ] , we use a local optimum to decide the community size . For each set Si consisting of the i vertices with the highest probability scores , we evaluate the quality via a candidate scoring function f . We truncate at the first local optimum of f ( Si ) to obtain the extracted community .
In minimizing a scoring function such as conductance , we increase the index i in the sorted y to find the first minimum . Since the function does not smoothly decrease to the minimum , we search for indices n0 and ˆn ( n0 < ˆn ) , such that function f starts increasing at ˆn and the drop from f ( n0 ) to f ( ˆn ) satisfies f ( n0 ) ≥ γf ( ˆn ) . Experiments show that γ = 1.7 yields good results across all the datasets .
D . Fine tuning the Local Community
After the initial membership identification , we further improve the detection quality by iteratively augmenting the seed set with the top elements in the sorted y , and use the enlarged seed set to fine tune the community . The intuition is that the top elements with high probabilities are likely to be in the target community , and augmenting the initial seed set would improve the detection accuracy by providing with more domain information .
Let the initial seed set S0 = S . At each iteration t , we enlarge the current seed set St by combining with the top |S| + δ · t candidate seeds2 . Define the weight of each initial seed in S to be w1 = 1/|S| , and the weight of each augmented seed in St/S0 to be w2 = 05w1 Then feed the expanded seed set to the modified problem LP2 by adding one more constraint on LP1 :
( 4 ) st
T y ≥ 1 + w2 ∗ ( |St| − |S| ) where st ∈ {0 , 1}n is a binary indicator vector for the current seed set St . We halve the weight of the expanded seeds such that the initial members play a key role for the identification .
To complete the process , we track the value of the scoring function on the extracted community , and stop the iteration when the community quality starts to decline . Experiments show that the F1 scores increase considerably by 0.12 on average over the five real world networks .
V . MULTIPLE MEMBERSHIP IDENTIFICATION
As individuals tend to be in multiple communities simultaneously , we further address the problem of finding the number of communities to which an individual is in and identifying those communities .
Regard the individual seed s as an “ ego ” , and temporarily remove s from its ego network to get connected components sorted by their sizes in decreasing order , namely S1 , S2 , , Sq . Each {s} ∪ Si is regarded as a candidate initial seed set . Iteratively start from each initial seed set , remove edges connecting s to other ego neighbors , and identify the corresponding community by using LOSP as a subroutine . Seed sets completely contained in previous communities will not be processed . In this way , we find a set of local overlapping communities for a single seed . The first is the community the seed is mostly attached to .
A crucial step is that we cut edges connecting s to other candidate seed sets so as to weaken the interference of different seed sets . If a candidate seed set still has very strong connections to the current target structure , it will be completely covered by the extracted community and will then be removed from the candidate seed list .
VI . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We implement LOSP in Matlab 3and compare with state ofthe art local community detection algorithms . For each of the datasets , we randomly select 500 annotated communities , and randomly pick one or three exemplary seeds from each target community . The mean and standard deviation of F1 scores over all trials are used for the evaluation and comparison .
A . Evaluation on LOSP
In this subsection , we investigate how the performance of LOSP is affected by the choice of : 1 ) graph Laplacian matrix , 2 ) community scoring function , 3 ) seed set structure , and 4 ) seed set size . We use the ground truth size in evaluating 1 ) , 3 ) , and 4 ) to factor out the impact of stopping criteria .
Normalized Matrices . Nrw and Nsym are related to the normalized graph Laplacian Lrw = I − Nrw and Lsym = I − Nsym . In the classical spectral method , as the degrees are very broadly distributed in most real world networks , it is preferable to use normalized spectral clustering , and in the normalized case to use Lrw rather than Lsym [ 14 ] . Table 2 shows the average F1 scores using the two different local spectral subspaces defined by Nrw and Nsym , respectively . Nrw performs better than Nsym on average .
Community Scoring Functions . Different community scoring functions can be adapted to LOSP in determining the local community structure . Fig 1 shows the average F1 scores and standard deviations of the resulting communities with

Conductance and TPN consistently outperform other metrics . Note that we work with the sampled subgraph when calculating the scoring functions for candidate communities , and all the metrics are calculated within the scope of sampled graph .
Seed Structure . To understand how the structure of the initial seed set affects the accuracy of the resulting community , we quantitatively evaluate the performance of five different seeding strategies . Random seeding randomly picks |S| vertices from the target community C . High ( low ) degree seeding randomly picks |S| vertices with degree ranked in the top ( bottom ) one third . High triangle participation seeding sorts vertices according to the number of triangles they belong to in C , and randomly picks seeds ranked in the top one third . Low escape seeding sorts vertices basing on the probability reserved after a short random walk starting from each vertex , and randomly picks seeds in the top one third . low degree , random , triangle ( high triangle participation ) and low escape yield almost the same accuracy on average . Due to the power law degree distribution , most of the vertices are of low degree . And this explains why low degree seeding and random seeding yield almost the same performance . Low degree seeds spread out the probabilities slowly and better preserve the local structure . High triangle participation seeds and low escape seeds follow another philosophy in that they choose seeds more cohesive to the target community , resulting in high quality output .
Fig 2 shows that
High degree seeds are inferior to the previous four seed structures in that the probabilities spread out very quickly from these popular individuals , causing less accuracy . Also , high degree vertices behave as the “ hubs ” while low degree vertices have more loyalty to the target community .
Seed Set Size . Fig 3 shows the average F1 scores of the communities by starting from one or three random seed(s ) . Due to space limitation , we only show the result with conductance as the scoring functions . We see that LOSP is able to achieve high accuracy even with a single seed . B . Comparisons with Local Algorithms
We compare LOSP with the state of the art local community detection algorithms . The results of applying the best two

We randomly pick one seed from each target community , and compare the average F1 scores with Heat Kernel4 [ 8 ] under the same condition . The authors compared their results with pprpush [ 1 ] , and Heat Kernel far outperforms pprpush by almost doubling the F1 scores . We then randomly pick three seeds from each target community , and compare LOSP with LEMON [ 10 ] that reports result using conductance as scoring function and starts from three random seeds . Table 3 shows that LOSP apparently outperforms Heat Kernel and LEMON . Fig 4 illustrates examples of the detected local communities starting from three random seeds .

C . All Local Membership Identification
To reveal all communities to which a single seed s belongs , we group the vertices in the ground truth according to their overlapping memberships om , randomly pick 500 vertices in each group ( pick all if the vertices in a group is less than 500 ) and find all their membership communities .
We preprocess the ground truth by removing identical copies of ground truth communities , and obtain 1517 , 4959 , 4703 , 4771 and 4885 ground truth communities for the five datasets . The ground truth communities of Amazon form a typical hierarchical dendrogram , those of LiveJ also reveal hierarchical structure . Others form overlapping relationships .

Table 4 shows the average F1 scores of om ∈ {1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5} by using ground truth size or the best two scoring functions . The average F1 scores decline for larger om , coinciding with the intuition that multiple memberships make the detection task harder . On average , we achieve a high F1 score of 0.40 over all datasets and different community boundary strategies . Fig 5 illustrates all the detected local communities of an exemplary vertex in four annotated communities from DBLP . Note that our method is different from sweeping the function curve to find multiple local minima [ 17 ] , which essentially finds hierarchical communities .
VII . CONCLUSION
We define a local invariant subspace spanned by a few leading approximate eigenvectors of the neighborhood subgraph around the seeds , and present a systematic and effective approach called LOSP for finding local overlapping communities . We defined two new community scoring functions , triad participation number ( TPN ) and normalized modularity , for the stopping rules of community boundary . The structural properties of different seed sets are discussed .
We demonstrate that LOSP outperforms the state of the art local diffusion methods in real world networks across multiple domains , and reduces the complexity by running in time and space polynomial in the scale of the local structure . We further effectively find all overlapping local communities for a single vertex by applying LOSP as a subroutine .
