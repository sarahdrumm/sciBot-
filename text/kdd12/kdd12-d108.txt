ABSTRACT Suppose we have two competing ideas/products/viruses , that propagate over a social or other network . Suppose that they are strong/virulent enough , so that each , if left alone , could lead to an epidemic . What will happen when both operate on the network ? Earlier models assume that there is perfect competition : if a user buys product ‘A’ ( or gets infected with virus ‘X’ ) , she will never buy product ‘B’ ( or virus ‘Y’ ) . This is not always true : for example , a user could install and use both Firefox and Google Chrome as browsers . Similarly , one type of flu may give partial immunity against some other similar disease .
In the case of full competition , it is known that ‘winner takes all,’ that is the weaker virus/product will become extinct . In the case of no competition , both viruses survive , ignoring each other . What happens in between these two extremes ?
We show that there is a phase transition : if the competition is harsher than a critical level , then ‘winner takes all;’ otherwise , the weaker virus survives . These are the contributions of this paper ( a ) the problem definition , which is novel even in epidemiology literature [ 3 , 17 , 35 ] ( b ) the phase transition result and ( c ) experiments on real data , illustrating the suitability of our results .

INTRODUCTION
Given two partially competing products ( like Firefox and Google Chrome ; or Android and iPhone ) , is it possible that they both survive ?
The well known Competitive Exclusion Principle in ecology states that when two species are in complete competition under constant conditions , the more fit one will eventually drive the less fit one into extinction . A more common but less well understood scenario is one where the competing species induce partial immunity against one another . There has been significant work trying to elucidate the conditions under which such partial immunity leads to coexistence [ 25 , 11 , 26 ] but a complete theory has not yet emerged .
Here , we study the general case of two virus strains with partial ( and symmetric ) cross immunity spreading over a fixed network topology . In addition to the implications for the evolutionary problem discussed above , our results have direct relevance to the spread of rumors and opinions in social networks and market penetration of products . The contributions of this work are the following : • the discovery that there is a phase transition , that is , the weaker virus/product may survive , if the crossimmunity satisfies a threshold condition . This seemed to be an open problem even within the epidemiology community [ 25 ] • experiments on real data , showing that our model fits well
Figure 1 shows the time plots for partially competing products Hulu vs . Blockbuster ( a ) , and Google Chrome vs . Firefox ( b ) . They plot ( normalized ) count of Google queries , versus time . We fit our model to the data1 and plot it as well . Notice that it captures the trends well . The rest of the paper is organized in the usual way : we review related work in § 2 and formulate the problem giving details of our model in § 3 . We give the analysis and proof of our phase transition and coexistence result in § 4 and demonstrate the validity of the results using simulations and real world case studies in § 5 . Finally , we discuss other subtle aspects of the model in § 6 and conclude in § 7 .
2 . RELATED WORK
Here we provide a brief overview of the vast literature on epidemiology , influence propagation and population ecology . Epidemiology and Epidemic Thresholds There are numerous , well studied epidemiological models , including the so called homogeneous models [ 4 , 27 , 3 ] . They effectively assume that the network is a full clique , that is , every person has the same probability to contact every other person . A large portion of the literature focuses on a single virus , and

Figure 1 : Plots of real web search interest vs . time for pairs of competitors with our model fitted to the data . even then , there are numerous interesting sub cases . Typical propagation models include SIS ( flu like , with no immunity Susceptible / Infected / Susceptible ) , SIR ( mumps like , with lifetime immunity ‘R’= ‘recovered’ ) , SIRS ( with temporary immunity ) , and many many more see [ 17 ] for a detailed survey , or the 700 page book of Anderson and May [ 3 ] .
A lot of attention focuses on the so called epidemic threshold : under what conditions will a virus ( say , flu like ) become extinct ? Earlier works [ 19 , 28 ] studied specific topologies ( eg , random graphs , power law graphs , etc ) . Chakrabarti et al . [ 10 ] and Ganesh et al . [ 13 ] found that , for arbitrary topologies , and for the flu like SIS model , the epidemic threshold for any arbitrary graph is determined by the leading eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the graph . Prakash et . al . [ 31 ] generalized this result to any topology , as well as almost any virus propagation model ( SIR , SIRS , etc ) . However , all of these works focus on single virus models .
Recent work [ 30 ] looked at a two virus SIS model on arbitrary graphs , but focused on the case where there was full mutual immunity between viruses . Their theorem says that , in such a setting , the stronger virus will push the weaker one to extinction ( ‘winner takes all’ ) , even if the weaker one would be able to survive on the network when left alone . Influence propagation information diffusion Biological viruses are not the only objects of interest that propagate over the edges of a network . Rumors , ideas , memes , and computer worms behave similarly and have attracted a lot of interest , especially recently thanks to the internet and the web . Research focuses on topics that include ( a ) information cascades [ 6 , 14 ] , ( b ) blog propagation [ 24 , 16 , 21 , 33 ] , and ( c ) viral marketing and product penetration [ 23 ] . Typical cascade models include ( a ) the independent cascade [ 18 ] ( essentially an ‘SIR’ mumps like model ) and ( b ) linear threshold [ 15 ] . Research work in multiple cascades has examined extensions of the independent cascade model for the case that nodes can not switch from one competitor to the other [ 5 , 20 ] , as well as when they can [ 29 ] .
There are several fascinating , but remotely related problems : ( a ) which nodes to immunize , given a finite count of vaccines [ 32 , 36 ] ( b ) which are the best nodes to advertize a new product , to maximize product penetration [ 12 ] ( c ) which nodes are the most likely to be the culprits , when we are given a snapshot of infected nodes in a graph . [ 22 , 34 ] Ecology In ecology , the principle of ‘competitive exclusion’ espouses that two species can not occupy the same ecological niche in the long term . That is , ‘winner takes all’ , using our earlier terminology . Research has gone into studying this using various propagation models like SIS , SIR , LotkaVolterra etc . ( for example , see [ 8 , 9 , 1 , 2] ) . Partial immunity models have received much attention in epidemiology . For example , [ 25 ] suggests a differential equation based model and analyzes it via simulation . However , for this and most other models of interest , a complete analytical solution has been beyond reach . Distinguishing features of current work : In short , none of the previous work fulfills all the conditions of this current work : ( a ) analytical proof of critical , the critical value of the competition threshold ( b ) closed form steady state behavior ( c ) under an SIS ( flu like ) model . 3 .

12 The solution at the coexistence equilib rium ( if exists ) the popular “ flu like ” SIS ( Susceptible Infected Susceptible ) model [ 17 ] . SI1|2S denotes Susceptible Infected1 or 2 Susceptible . Each node in the graph can be in one of four states : Susceptible ( healthy ) , I1 ( infected by virus 1 ) , I2 ( infected by virus 2 ) , or I1,2 ( infected by both virus 1 and virus 2 ) . The state transition diagram as seen from a node in the network is shown in Figure 2 . We could have extended other single virus models as well , but we believe that our model is a reasonable starting point , and we leave the analysis of other models as future work .
Healing ( virus death ) rate : δ .
If a node is in an infected state ( I1 , I2 , or I1,2 ) , it recovers on its own with some rate , δ1 for virus 1 or δ2 for virus 2 . The healing rate is inversely related with the virus ’s strength : a high δ means that nodes that are infected heal quickly . For example , a product that lasts a long time such that people using it rarely consider alternatives would be modeled with a low δ value .
Attack ( virus transmission ) rate : β . An infected node can spread the virus to its neighboring nodes , and the node susceptibility is captured by β1 and β2 . Specifically , an infected node transmits its infection to each of its healthy neighbors independently at rate β1 ( or β2 ) . The more often an idea or product is shared with friends , frequently referred to as being “ viral , ” the higher the value for β .
Virus interaction factor : . A node infected with one virus may be more or less susceptible to being infected by the other virus , as determined by the factor . The transmission rate for a virus becomes β1 ( or β2 ) when a node is already infected with one virus . Specifically , if a node is infected with virus 1 , each of its neighbors infected with virus 2 have a transmission rate to it of β2 ; a node infected with virus 2 can only be infected with virus 1 at a rate of β1 .
This is a novel generalization of the single virus SIS model to a multiple virus scenario . The value of can describe many different virus interactions . If = 0 then the viruses are fully mutually immune , and 0 < ≤ 1 suggests an amount of competition between viruses .
Fair play : We assume that the competitors are playing a ‘fair game’ : All nodes in the network have the same model parameters ( β ’s , δ ’s , ) for each of the viruses and behave according to the state diagram in Figure 2 . 3.2 Problem Statement
We are now in a position to state the problem formally . We assume the underlying network is connected otherwise we just have separate disconnected problems . Interacting viruses problem Given : An undirected connected graph G , and the propagation model ( SI1|2S ) parameters ( β1 , δ1 for virus 1 , β2 , δ2 for virus 2 , and ) Find : What are the possible fixed points for the system ? In particular , for what values of is there a fixed point for which both virus 1 and virus 2 survive ? 3.3 Model Formulation for a Clique
For a clique , the following differential equations fully describe the transitions of the system , seen in Figure 2 . Here I1 , I2 , and I1,2 are the number of nodes infected with only virus 1 , only virus 2 , and both virus 1 and 2 respectively . N is the total number of nodes , and S is the number of susceptible nodes ( S = N − I1 − I2 − I12 ) . dI1 dt dI2 dt dI12 dt
= β1S(I1 + I12 ) + δ2I12 − δ1I1 − β2I1(I2 + I12 ) ( 1 ) = β2S(I2 + I12 ) + δ1I12 − δ2I2 − β1I2(I1 + I12 ) ( 2 ) = β1I2(I1 + I12 ) + β2I1(I2 + I12)−(δ1 + δ2)I12 ( 3 )
4 . RESULTS AND PROOFS
The goal of our analysis is to find for what values of is there an equilibrium point for which both virus 1 and virus 2 survive . We find that there is an critical such that if > critical then an equilibrium point for which the viruses coexist . 4.1 Formulating the problem
At an equilibrium point , all derivatives are zero . Thus , we can find a simple equation for I12
( β1 + β2)I1I2 = ( δ1 + δ2 − ( β1I2 + β2I1))I12
Lemma 1 . The number of people infected by both virus 1 and virus 2 will obey the following equation :
I12 = I1I2 ( β1 + β2)/(δ1 + δ2 − ( β1I2 + β2I1 ) )
Proof . Trivial , given the above .
Thus we have the expected three equilibrium points • I1 = I2 = I12 = 0 • I1 = I12 = 0 , I2 = N − δ2 • I2 = I12 = 0 , I1 = N − δ1
β2
β1 and possibly one for which I1 , I2 > 0 and obeys the differential equations outlined :
0 = β1S(I1 + I12 ) + δ2I12 − δ1I1 − β2I1(I2 + I12 ) 0 = β2S(I2 + I12 ) + δ1I12 − δ2I2 − β1I2(I1 + I12 ) 0 = β1I2(I1 + I12 ) + β2I1(I2 + I12 ) − ( δ1 + δ2)I12
( 4 )
( 5 ) ( 6 )
We rework these equations to be primarily in terms of κ1 , κ2 , i12 , where κ1 = ( I1 + I12)/N , κ2 = ( I2 + I12)/N , i12 = I12/N . As such , each of these terms represent a fraction of the population that is infected . We first convert the constraints to
N κ1β1[1 − κ1 − ( 1 − )i2 ] = δ1κ1 N κ2β2[1 − κ2 − ( 1 − )i1 ] = δ2κ2
N ( β1κ1i2 + β2κ2i1 ) = ( δ1 + δ2)i12
( 7 ) ( 8 )
( 9 ) where i1 = I1/N and i2 = I2/N .
Manipulating ( 9 ) to remove i1 and i2 , we find
κ1κ2[σ1δ1 + σ2δ2 ] = i12[δ1 +δ2 + σ1δ1κ1 + σ2δ2κ2 ] ( 10 )
Remember , because we are working with a clique the virus strengths are σ1 = N β1/δ1 and σ2 = N β2/δ2 . 4.2 Results
From these constraints , we look to find a lower bound on , such that for any less competition there can be coexistence .

Proof . In Lemma 3 we give the possible fixed point for coexistence . In Lemma 4 we show the constraints for the fixed points to be real , which contribute to the bounds in ( 11 ) . In Lemmas 5 through 9 we give the proofs for the constraints on the fixed points being positive , and in Lemma 10 we give the proof that the fixed points are less than one .
Next we describe all of the Lemmas , which contribute to the proof .
Lemma 2 . If a fourth equilibrium point exists , then it should satisfy the follow equation :
( κ2 − κ1 ) = 1/σ1 − 1/σ2
( 12 )
Proof . Since we are only looking for non zero solutions for κ1 and κ2 , we can eliminate them in ( 7 ) and ( 8 ) .

Proof . This constraint comes from the square root in equation ( 17 ) for κ∗ 2 . We analyze the quadratic equation 4 − 4 + 2σ1σ2 ( in terms of ) from inside the square root . It is a simple , upward facing parabola . Solving for the roots of the quadratic equation in terms of we find

For σ1σ2 > 1 there is no solution because the equation is positive for all values of . Thus , if σ1σ2 > 1 then κ∗ 2 must be real valued . For σ1σ2 < 1 a portion of the parabola is negative . Therefore , we require that be in the positive region of the quadratic equation , where is less than the lower root or greater than the upper root .
To find when κ∗
2 ≥ 0 , we consider the cases above for which it is real . As we explained before , we will focus on the lower bound for .

Because σ1σ2 > 1 , all of the square roots are real valued . The denominator is clearly positive , so to prove that κ∗ 2 is monotonically increasing , we must show that the numerator is positive . To show that the numerator is always positive we would like to show that

Since from the previous lemma we know that it is monotonically increasing , κ − 2 < κ+ for all ≥ 0 , since the last term is always positive . We will see later that κ+ 2 < 1 for all > 0 . Therefore , the range for which κ 2 is valid .

For this to be positive we must have which is true for σ1 + σ2 < 2 .

This can be simplified as follows :

5 . EXPERIMENTS
We demonstrate our result using ( a ) simulation experi ments and ( b ) case studies using real data in this section . 5.1 Setup
Without loss of generality , in our experiments we assumed that the first virus is the stronger virus . We primarily focus on the case where σ1 > σ2 > 1 . For our simulations we use σ1 = 6 and σ2 = 4 .
We run a simulation on a fully connected clique of 1000 nodes . We vary around our expected threshold and for each value of perform 10 runs over 4000 time steps . On each run we begin by infecting 30 nodes at random with each virus .
We analyze the results in two ways . First , we create a steady state plot of mean values and standard deviations for κ1 , κ2 , and i12 at steady state over a range of values for . Over the results of the simulation we draw the behavior predicted by our results . Second , for one > critical we track each virus ’s development over time with a time plot . The time plot takes the average number of nodes infected ( κ1 , κ2 , and i12 ) at each time step and plots this against time . Although the simulations were run for 4000 time steps , the plots are truncated to give more detail to the initial fluctuations of the virus counts .
( a ) σ1 = 6 , σ2 = 4
( b ) = 0.4 > critical = 1 , σ1 = 6 , σ2 = 4
Figure 3 : Coexistence is possible : Results from simulations on clique of size 1000 with theoretical fixed points overlayed . ( a ) shows the steady state population values , κ1 , κ2 , and i12 , for each value of , with the theoretical critical marked . ( b ) shows the development of the two viruses over time for > critical . Notice that both viruses survive as expected .
5.2 Simulation Results Figure 3 displays our results .
In short , the plots agree exactly with our result , as expected . Figure 3(a ) shows the steady state plot for the two viruses , and the theoretical predictions closely match the simulation results . Similarly , the viruses’ growth as shown in the time plot in Figure 3(b ) matches what is expected .
For the steady state plot , we expect the steady state value to be one of the other fixed points where at least one virus dies out for ≤ critical and then a co existence for > critical . In Figure 3(a ) we see for σ1 > σ2 > 1 and = 0 , winner takes all , as was proven in [ 30 ] . However , for > critical we see a coexistence between the viruses as expected ; this is true even when the viruses are competing ( < 1 ) . For = 0.4 > critical we have the time plot , Figure 3(b ) , showing the growth of both viruses to steady state from a small infection in the system . 5.3 Case Studies using Real Data
We collected historical data for ‘web search interest’ for various competing products from the Google Insights website2 , which aims to “ provide insights into broad search patterns . ” This allows us to use the data as a proxy for sales/interest for each product . We used the following pairs of rival products :
1 . Hulu3 and Blockbuster4 : Although not direct competitors , both offer video entertainment services , though under very different models .
2 . Firefox5 and Google Chrome6 : Two rival web browsers .
We consider both pairs of products to be examples of cases where there is partial mutual immunity ; people can use both products , but the use of one we expect would detract from the use of the other . While our model does not describe the situations perfectly , we believe it is a good approximation .
2wwwgooglecom/insights/search/ 3wwwhulucom 4wwwblockbustercom 5wwwmozillaorg/en US/firefox/new/ 6wwwgooglecom/chrome
In Figure 4 we show plots of the web interest vs . time for both pairs of products , along with our model fitted to the data7 . In Figure 4(a ) , we used a virus interaction factor of = 0.7 ( along with virus parameters δHulu = 0.04 , βHulu = 0.0007 , δBlockbuster = 0.05 , βBlockbuster = 000045 ) In Figure 4(b ) , we used a virus interaction factor of = 0.6 ( along with virus parameters δFirefox = 0.01 , βFirefox = 0.000095 , δChrome = 0.01 , βChrome = 000015 ) In Figure 4(c ) we use the same model as ( b ) but let the model continue to see the projected steady state behavior . We note that the plots begin when Hulu and Chrome are first introduced and with Blockbuster and Firefox at a previous steady state behavior . In each of these fittings we see that our model fits the data well . The fact that the model fits the data well demonstrates the suitability of our SI1|2S model .

Conjecture 1
( Epsilon Threshold Upper Bound ) . Given an arbitrary graph with the SI1|2S model parameters σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ 1 , an equilibrium point for which both virus 1 and virus 2 survive exists if > critical , where critical ≤ 1 σ2
( 24 )
Justification : Since σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ 1 and 0 < < 1 , we know that both virus 1 and virus 2 would be strong enough to survive independently but there is some competition between them . Because of the competition , as virus 1 spreads to more nodes , virus 2 ’s attack rate on average decreases and thus its strength decreases . Therefore , if we overestimate the strength or number of people with virus 1 , this only makes it more difficult for virus 2 survive and thus decreases the maximum amount of competition virus 2 can handle , increasing critical . To simplify the problem , we assume that every person is infected with virus 1 ( as if virus 1 was infinitely strong ) . In this case , a node can only be in state I1

Data acquired from Google Trends . or I1,2 , and the probability of a node with virus 2 infecting a neighbor is always β2 . This is now equivalent to a one virus model where the strength of virus 2 is σ 2 = σ2 . Therefore , as shown in previous research [ 10 , 13 , 31 ] , if σ 2 > 1 then virus 2 will survive . In this case , critical = 1 . However , beσ2 cause this is a relaxation of the original problem , we know that this is an upper bound and in fact critical ≤ 1 6.2 Case Study : Qualitative Analysis
σ2
.
We also consider the example of educational ideas , and specifically sex education , as a virus . Sociology literature analyzing the success of sex education programs notes the impact of network effects and social structure on sex education success [ 7 ] . We match education policy to our SI1|2S model and analyze the implications . Policy 1 : Abstinence Only Education Abstinence only education teaches abstinence until marriage as the only way to live a healthy life , with students often taking an abstinence pledge . Under our model , virus 1 is believing in abstinence ( through education or pledge ) and virus 2 is sexual activity . Therefore , those who are in I1 have taken a pledge of abstinence , those who are in I2 are sexually active , and those people who are in S do not believe in abstinence but are not sexually active either . It is obviously impossible to both be following an abstinence pledge and to be sexually active so nobody can be in state I1,2 . Equivalently in this case there is full mutual immunity or = 0 . Model 1 Predictions and Results Based on this fit , because = 0 , our model predicts ‘winner takes all:’ the weaker virus dies out and the stronger virus survives . Sociology research [ 7 ] , studying over 11,000 people over 7 years , notes that of the 2399 people claiming to have taken an abstinence pledge , 1622 ( 67 % ) over time forgot . This suggests that σAbstinence < σSexual Activity , and as a result , in the long run sexual activity will win over abstinence . Policy 2 : Comprehensive Sex Education Comprehensive sex education teaches numerous methods to have a safe , healthy sex life , discussing both contraception and abstinence . Matching this to our model , virus 1 is being educated in safe sex practices and valuing their importance and virus 2 is sexual activity . Therefore , those who are in I1 have been educated about safe sex practices and believe they are important but are not sexually active , those in I2 are sexually active but do not practice safe sex , those in I1,2 practice safe sex , and those in S are neither educated on safe sex practices nor sexually active . Here we expect little to no competition between the two viruses and thus have an value close to , if not equal to , 1 .
Model 2 Predictions and Results Because is close to 1 , we expect that > critical . As a result , it is possible for there to be coexistence of the two viruses , such that there can be a steady state in which people are sexually active and practice safe sex . This appears to match sociology literature claiming that those who initially use condoms will keep using condoms [ 7 ] . In summary , our model qualitatively agrees with sociology research and offers a plausible explanation for the results of the study . Additionally , these two cases demonstrate the value of a phase transition . In the first case , the model suggests winner takes all and the ineffectiveness of abstinenceonly education . On the contrary , for policy 2 , the model predicts coexistence , which agrees with the findings , and is better for society . 6.3 Subtle Points
There are several subtle points , that we deferred until now , for clarity of exposition . Specifically , here we discuss the following issues :
631 What does it mean for > 1 ? As before , the virus 2 transmission rate for a virus infected with virus 1 becomes β2 and the virus 1 transmission rate for a virus infected with virus 2 becomes β1 . However , because > 1 the transmission rate for each virus increases for neighbors that are already infected . We consider this to be a form of cooperation between the viruses ( products , ideas , etc )
This pattern of cooperation between products is common in product ecosystems . An example of this is that people who have an iPod are more likely to buy music and videos through Apple ’s iTunes . Making use of such cooperation can be seen in ‘freebie marketing’ or the ‘razor and blades business model,’ in which the company producing razor blades sells the razors at an artificially low price creating a market for the blades . This method of tightly integrating products is common in a variety of industries . 632 What happens if σ2 or σ1 ≤ 1 ? Because σ1 ≥ σ2 there are two cases we can analyze . The first is when σ1 ≥ 1 > σ2 , in which the second virus is too weak to survive on its own . We will refer to this as the “ piggyback setting , ” because virus 2 can only survive with the help of the first . The second condition is when 1 > σ1 ≥ σ2 , where both viruses are independently too weak to survive . We will refer to this as the “ teamwork setting , ” because only through cooperation can both viruses survive .

Figure 5 : With enough collaboration , even weak viruses can survive . Results from simulations on population of N = 1000 with theoretical values overlayed , and 1 > σ2 . The first column , ( a ) and ( c ) , is the “ piggyback ” case where just virus 2 is too weak to survive . The second column , ( b ) and ( d ) , is the “ teamwork ” case where neither virus is on its own strong enough to survive . The top row gives the steady state plots , showing the steady state footprint vs . the interaction factor . The second row gives the time plots , showing the infection footprint developing over time .
In each of these cases , Theorem 1 still holds plugging in σ1 and σ2 we find an critical for which a fixed point in which κ1 , κ2 > 0 exists . This suggests that even if both viruses are independently too weak to survive on their own , with enough cooperation they can .
To test our theorem , we ran similar simulations where either one or both viruses were too weak to independently survive . In Figure 5(a ) we show the steady state plot for the piggyback case of σ1 > 1 > σ2 . As expected , for = 1 when the viruses are independent , virus 1 survives but virus 2 is not strong enough and dies out . For a sufficient amount of cooperation , > critical , we find that virus 2 can survive as well . We see in Figure 5(c ) , the corresponding time plot where = 3.5 > critical , that once virus 1 grows , virus 2 is able to survive as well . We also simulated the teamwork case , where neither virus is independently strong enough to survive , 1 > σ1 ≥ σ2 . In Figure 5(b ) we show the steady state plot for this case . Again , the theoretical result and predicted phase transition match the simulation results . For = 1 , the two viruses are independent and , since they cannot survive on their own , die out . In this case , the phase transition is based on the second part of Theorem 1 where σ1 +σ2 < 2 , and as such the bound is a result on the restriction of κ2 being real . As such , at critical both κ1 , κ2 > 0 rather than equal to 0 . We see here at the threshold a large amount of uncertainty in the simulation but as we move away from the threshold the simulation follows this new fixed point . Interestingly , we must initially infect a large portion of the graph for the system to go to this fixed point , and not die out . For = 7.75 > critical , Figure 5(d ) shows the time plot , demonstrating that both viruses quickly reach steady state with a high amount of overlap .
7 . CONCLUSIONS
We defined and studied the problem of partial competition , where two viruses/products provide partial immunity against each other .
The main contributions of our work are as follows :
1 . Problem Definition : The problem is novel , in the data mining and web mining communities , and even in the epidemiology literature [ 3 , 17 ] .
2 . Threshold Result and Proof : We showed that there is a phase transition : ‘winner takes all,’ until the competition level drops below a critical value . Above this critical value we find a closed form steady state solution with coexistence .
3 . Experiments and Case studies : We showed results from real settings ( like browsers Firefox vs Google Chrome ) , which agree with our model .
