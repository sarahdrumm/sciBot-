ABSTRACT In this paper , we propose a method to cluster the spacial patterns of the visual field in glaucoma patients to analyze the progression patterns of glaucoma . The degree of progression in the visual field of glaucoma patients can be divided into several regions by straight line boundaries , we call this specific structure Direct Product Structure in this paper . Since we can observe the direct product structure in the visual fields , we propose a bottom up hierarchical clustering method to embed this structure into the clustering structure . In our method , according to the minimum description length ( MDL ) principle , we select the best cluster division so that the total code length required for encoding the data as well as the clustering structure is minimum . We can thereby select the clusters that are robust to the noise in the position of the direct product structure for clustering . We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using an artificial dataset and a real glaucoma dataset . Our proposed method performed better than existing methods for both datasets . For the real glaucoma dataset in particular , our method discovered the characteristic progressive patterns of glaucoma as specific features of clusters .

INTRODUCTION
1 . 1.1 Background of this Study
Glaucoma is a chronic disease of eyes , which affects the field of vision ( visual field ) . The mechanism of the progression of glaucoma is based on an increase in fluid pressure on the eye . As this pressure increases , the optical nerve is damaged which leads to visual field loss . Glaucoma is one of the main causes of blindness worldwide . Patients are surgically treated , according to the progression speed and also the pattern of the disease , hence it is clinically useful to optimize the treatment using mined knowledge regarding glaucoma . A major field requiring mined knowledge regarding glaucoma is the prediction of glaucoma progression [ 10 , 12 , 13 ] . In the relevant studies , predicting models embedded with
1979 Figure 1 : Visual fields of glaucoma . ( a ) 74 diagnosis points are shown as the white box . ( b , c ) Direct product structure of real visual field data . Regions are divided by red straight lines . the characteristic features of glaucoma were constructed . Although these models performed well , many issues remain to be analyzed in order to improve the clinical setting .
Detecting characteristic progressive patterns on the visual fields of glaucoma patients is one of most challenging problems in research on predicting glaucoma progression . Clinical knowledge shows that the progression of glaucoma is deeply correlated with the pattern of optical nerves [ 6 ] , such as progression from the side of the ear and that from the side of the nose . If we can classify these progressive patterns , we may obtain useful knowledge from clinical data . Such knowledge might help clinicians in numerous ways , such as the visualization of implicit clinical knowledge , the detection of novel progressive patterns , the addition of new information to improve the accuracy of prediction , and the discovery of correlations between the progressive patterns and risk factors of glaucoma and so on . Therefore , we focus on clustering glaucoma visual field data .
In this paper , we propose a clustering method to analyze the progression patterns of glaucoma by using a real glaucoma patient dataset which is given as Figure 1(a ) . We can observe a characteristic special feature on the visual field of glaucoma eyes as shown in Figure 1(b ) , ( c ) . The red straight boundaries divide progression areas in both figures . We call this characteristic structure Direct Product Structure in this paper . To effectively mine knowledge from the dataset , we embed this direct product structure into our model . Past studies on pattern clustering of glaucoma primarily used a Gaussian mixture model [ 21 ] and independent component analysis [ 3 ] . These methods could not embed spacial information into the analyses , and the number of clusters had to be given in advance . Therefore , we propose a novel clustering method that embeds specific features of glaucoma into the model , and can automatically choose the best number of clusters . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first approach of its kind in glaucoma analyses .
We focus on spatial information in glaucoma progression . We show two sets of visual field data in Figure 1(b ) , ( c ) . We can see that the red straight boundaries divide progression areas in both figures . However , these boundaries are similar but in slightly different positions . Therefore , a clustering technique is needed that classifies data with similar direct product structures together by tolerating slight differences in their spatial positions . We implemented this architecture by coding such features into our proposed technique . Under the minimum description length ( MDL ) principle [ 18 ] , our proposed hierarchical clustering method obtains optimal clustering division where the total code length required for encoding the data as well as the clustering structure is minimum . We specifically employ the normalized maximum likelihood coding ( NML ) [ 18 ] for the encoding of data .
Our method worked better than comparative methods in clustering an artificial dataset . We further found progressive patterns in the real glaucoma dataset . Our method sensitively detects the difference of progression stages in glaucoma . Moreover , we applied our clustering method to the prediction of glaucoma progression . Liang et al . [ 10 ] recently proposed a framework for predicting glaucoma progression on the basis of spatio temporal pattern clustering . By using our clusters in the clustering part of Liang et al . ’s framework , we were able to significantly improve the prediction accuracy with a few data points in previous works . 1.2 Novelty of this Study
The novelty of our research can be summarized in the following : ( 1 ) A novel clustering method of visual field data on glaucoma ; ( 2 ) Mining deep knowledge in ophthalmology . We first propose a novel clustering method considering specific features of glaucoma . Many past studies did not use the spatial information of the visual field for clustering visual fields . The relevant spatial information constitutes important knowledge because the progression of glaucoma is deeply correlated with the spatial patterns of the optical nerves . Our proposed method embeds characteristic direct product features into our models and tolerates slight differences in boundary positions of divided ares in glaucoma ( see Figure 1(b ) , ( c) ) . Moreover , we employ bottom up hierarchical clustering based on the MDL principle , which can automatically determine the number of clusters .
We obtained the following knowledge of glaucoma using this method . Firstly , we can divide visual field data into clusters which correspond to damaged areas of visual field . This was not achieved in previous works . Secondly , we find that obtained clusters can reflect the time evolution of visual field in glaucoma progression . This result agrees with the clinical knowledge . Finally , we find that obtained clusters can contribute to the improvement of the prediction accuracy by applying them into the previous prediction method . 1.3 Related Works
Because numerous studies have been conducted in the field of glaucoma progression prediction , we summarize here a few recent studies involving the embedding of glaucomaspecific features into models . Liang et al . [ 10 ] proposed a prediction method based on spatio temporal clustering . This method collects data regarding patients with similar progressive patterns to form a prediction target patient . Maya et al . [ 12 ] proposed a prediction method based on a multi task learning algorithm . Their method does not apply clustering to patient data for prediction , but instead uses a multi task learning algorithm . Murata et al . [ 13 ] proposed a prediction method based on variational Bayesian learning . Their method involved embedding spatio temporal patterns of glaucoma patients into their models . Hirasawa et al . [ 9 ] investigated the relationship between the inspection points and progression rates . Asaoka [ 2 ] clustered the inspection points to understand the feature of regions .
In past research involving the clustering of the progressive patterns of glaucoma , a Gaussian mixture model was used to show the correspondence of the clustering results and the existence of glaucoma [ 21 ] . Independent component analysis was employed to show the feature detection of the clusters

However , these methods embed neither specific feature of glaucoma nor the relevant spatial information into their models . The relationship between the local points of the visual field and optical nerves has also been studied [ 6 ] .
The visual field data of glaucoma can be treated as image data . The scale invariant feature transform ( SIFT ) algorithm [ 11 ] and the histogram of oriented gradients ( HOG ) feature descriptors [ 4 ] have been used in image processing . Although rotated patterns of glaucoma are different features because spatial positions are important , SIFT is consistent for rotating and scaling pictures , ie , SIFT does not suit our setting . Thus , to apply these features quantities to cluster glaucoma progression patterns , HOG is better than SIFT .
With regard to past studies on clustering methods related to our work here , a method combining the Gaussian mixture model and Laplacian regularization was proposed [ 7 ] . Hirai and Yamanishi [ 8 ] proposed an automatic decision of the number of clusters using a normalized maximum likelihood distribution . Papadimitriou et al . [ 14 ] proposed a top down hierarchical clustering method based on the MDL principle . 1.4 Organization of this Paper
This paper is organized as follows : In Section 2 , we introduce the glaucoma dataset . In Section 3 , we show the framework of our proposed method based on the MDL principle . The code length of our model is introduced in Sections 4 and 5 . In Section 6 , we provide the details of our proposed algorithm . We show the experimental results for the artificial dataset in Section 7 and those for real glaucoma dataset in Section 8 . We conclude our paper in Section 9 .
2 . GLAUCOMA DIAGNOSTIC DATA
The local points over the visual field are shown in Figure 1(a ) . The black parts are local points where diagnoses are not made . The number of local points is 74 , and an integer called total deviation ( TD ) , representing the loss of visual strength , is measured at each local point . The range of TD is approximately [ 40 , 0 ] . A small value of TD implies advanced damage of glaucoma at the relevant local point .
Glaucoma data are characterized by visual field data that often have direct product structures . The positions of the boundaries to specify the direct structures on visual field are not necessarily congruent ( see Figure 1(b ) , ( c) ) .
As shown in Figure 1(a ) , the visual field data has a gridlike structure and many points do not correspond to values . We complement these values with neighboring values of TDs for analyses . See Figure 2 for this compliment procedure . Values of the six points on each corner are determined as the mean of the TD of the neighboring four points . Values of the two points ( blind spots ) located at the center left are determined as the mean of the TD of neighboring three diagnosis points . Finally , we round these determined values because a value of the TD is an integer . As written above , many missing values in the original data shown as boxes with red line in Figure 2(a ) are completed in Figure 2(b ) .
3 . HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING
Our proposed clustering method divides a set of visual fields of glaucoma patients into several clusters . We employ a code length as a criterion to determine the optimal clustering division . Let us express the dataset with a series of codes f0 ; 1g , eg 010 , according to a coding rule . Then ,

( d ) Obtain the code length to represent the direct structure ( SCB ) . ( e ) Obtain the code length to produce elements in each region ( SCR ) . the dataset can be converted into a series of codes . The code length is the length of this series of codes . Under the minimum description length ( MDL ) principle [ 18 ] , the optimal selection is chosen when it achieves the minimum code length . The code length of our clustering model is composed of two parts : the code length of the rule of clustering divisions ( RCcode ) and the code length of each of the divided clusters ( DCcode ) . Under the MDL principle , optimal clustering division is obtained by minimizing the code length of our clustering model . However , it is difficult to obtain optimal clustering division because of its large time complexity due to the large number of possible clustering divisions .
In this paper , we propose a bottom up hierarchical clustering method ( BHCM ) which clears up this large time complexity by merging several clusters for each step . Furthermore , we embed characteristic spatial structures of the visual fields of glaucoma patients , the direct product structure ( see Figure 1 ) , into our model . This idea is effective in clustering glaucoma datasets . Its procedure is schematically shown in Figure 3 . Our method obtains clustering divisions by minimizing code length , the sum of RCcode and DCcode . Before introducing the detailed architecture of BHCM , we provide details of RCcode in Section 4 and DCcode in Sec

4 . CODE LENGTH OF DIVIDING RULE
Let us divide data from N visual fields into M clusters where the size of each cluster is km ( m = 1 ; : : : ; M ) . Note M that m=1 km = N . Under this rule of clustering division , the number of possible assignments of the visual filed data is M2 := N !=(k1!k2! kM ! ) .
We code the rule of clustering division by considering the information necessary to describe the implementation of the division . In this case , we need M + 2 natural numbers M , fkmg , and M2 . Note that we can record the realized assignments of visual field data using M2 if we set a counting rule , eg , the ascending order . The code length of any natural number m is log m := log(2:865 ) + log m + log log m [ 16 ] . Hence , the code length RCcode is given as fi

5 . CODE LENGTH OF CLUSTERS
2 ZH+1 and y(i ) row and y(i )
DCcode is the sum of the code lengths of all clusters . We focus hereafter on the code length of a single cluster . As in Section 2 , the glaucoma visual pattern has direct product structures . We describe embedding this characteristic into our model in Section 51 The code length of our model is given as a stochastic complexity ( SC ) in Sections 5.2 , 5.3 , and 54 We optimize the code length in Section 55 5.1 Direct Product Structure of Visual Fields We embed the direct product structure into our model . We assume that a visual field data is an S . T matrix . We divide this matrix into G . H regions with boundaries being normal to the axes . Figure 4(a ) is an example . Note that S ; T ; G ; and H are common to all visual field data . We denote variables as follows : the number of visual field data is n , the ith visual field data is xi 2 RS.T ( i = 1 ; : : : ; n ) , the ( u ; v)th element of xi is xi(u ; v ) , the horizontal and vertical boundary positions on the ith visual field data row 2 ZG+1 , respectively . The jth elare y(i ) col ement of y(i ) col are y(i ) col(j ) , respectively . Our proposed method allows different positions of boundaries in visual field data belonging to the same cluster . This is important to eliminate inessential difference in data . Although visual field data showing similar progressive patterns should be combined in the same cluster , slight differences between two sets of patterns might occur , as shown in Figure 4(a ) . Our proposed method combines these similar data patterns into the same cluster by using code length as a criterion because the code length decreases if the clustered visual field data are similar . 5.2 Stochastic Complexity Stochastic complexity ( SC ) is the code length of a dataset given a normalized maximum likelihood distribution PNML( ) ∫ [ 17 ] . When a data item x is generated from P ( Xj ) , the maximum likelihood estimator ^ is obtained . PNML( ) is ∑ P ( Xj^)dX ) . Unthen defined as PNML(X ) := ( P ( Xj^))=( der this probabilistic distribution , the code length of x SC is described as , log P ( xj^ ) + log x P ( xj^ ) . Although it row(j ) and y(i )

( b ) Parameters corresponding to regions . col = f0 ; 3 ; 5g ; y(2 ) is often difficult to directly obtain SC , Rissanen [ 15 ] showed the approximation of SC under certain conditions as follows : SC(x ) = , log P ( xj^ ) + jI()jd ;

When we restrict the integral intervals of the Fisher information matrix in Eq ( 2 ) to ,2 2 2 ff 2 ,2fi [ 8 ] , SC(x ) is given as , log P ( xj^ ; ^2 ) + and 2 2 log(x=(2 ) ) + 1:5 + fi + ff=2 . 5.3 Code Length of Dividing Boundaries ff
We assume that the boundaries of the data for the ith parow(g)j row tient belonging to a cluster are generated by P ( y(i ) or P ( y(i ) ( h,1 ) are parameters . The SC of the gth vertical boundary SCBR(g ) and the hth horizontal boundary SCBC(h ) are then derived as
( h,1) ) , where row col(h)j col

Thus , the code length of the boundaries , defined as SCB , is given as
SCB =

SCBC(h ) :
( 5 ) g=2 h=2
Note that we omit the boundaries g = 1 and h = 1 because they do not affect the division . 5.4 Code Length of Divided Regions
In this section , we derive the SC of the divided regions . The number of cells f ( g ; h ) within the ( g ; h)th region is obtained as f ( g ; h ) = row(g ) := row(g + 1 ) , y(i ) y(i ) col(h ) . i=1 z(i ) row(g ) and z(i ) row(g)z(i ) col(h ) := y(i ) col(h + 1 ) , y(i ) col(h ) , where z(i ) n

5.5 Optimizing Boundaries g=1 h=1 row and y(i )
In this section , we describe the optimization of the boundaries y(i ) col by minimizing the total code length of clusters SCC . From Eqs . ( 5 ) and ( 7 ) , SCC is derived as SCC = SCB + SCR . We note that SCB and SCR are functions of the boundaries . In the optimization procedure , procedures A step and B step are alternatively repeated five times . In A step , we update the positions of the boundaries under the condition that the parameters ( g;h ) , row ( g ) , and col ( h ) are fixed . In B step , we update the parameters ( g;h ) , row ( g ) , and col ( h ) under the condition that the positions of the boundaries are fixed . Following the repetitions , we run an additional Bstep to obtain maximum likelihood estimators ^(g;h ) , ^ row ( g ) , and ^ col ( h ) . Finally , we determine SCC using these estimated parameters . Note that while this architecture provides a local optimal SCC , our experiments indicate that our method is effective . The algorithm is summarized in Alg . 1 . The obtained SCC is the criterion for clustering decision described in later Section 6 . 551 A step In A step , we update the positions of the dividing boundaries using dynamical programming ( DP ) . In particular , we extend Dynamic Time Warping [ 19 ] to apply to our model . We first modify the code length of a cluster by obtaining the upper bound of SCC , and approximate it as follows :

) ) ) ) ) )
( 8 ) terms that did not correspond to the position of the dividing boundaries were omitted in Eq ( 8 ) . The derivation of Eq ( 8 ) is omitted due to the space limitation .
A crucial modification in Eq ( 8 ) from the original form of the SCC is that we can now separately analyze each patient ’s visual data . Recall that f ( g ; h ) is the number of cells belonging to the ( g ; h)th regions of all visual field data within a cluster . Even if a boundary of a visual field data item changes , several values of f ( g ; h ) change . This change affects all visual field data . To overcome this problem , we introduce the displacement of boundaries from equally divided points fSg=Gg and fT h=Hg . This idea enables the enhancement of the size of visual field data during DP . Moreover , this allows us to separately calculate the optimizing problem for each patient by modifying the summation of the ith visual field data . Therefore , we can solve an optimization problem for each data item . Hereafter , we use the value obtained from Eq ( 8 ) instead of the original code length . We now introduce our use of DP . Our goal is to obtain the optimal value of Eq ( 8 ) for the ith visual field ( S . T ) with G . H regions , which is defined as CDP [ S ; T ; G ; H ] . A subproblem then is to obtain the optimal value of Eq ( 8 ) for the ith visual field ( s . t ) with g . h regions , ie , CDP [ s ; t ; g ; h ] . Note that 1 s S ; 1 t T ; 1 g G ; 1 h H . In DP , a sub problem for the ith visual field ( s . t ) with g . h regions is generated by adding a new row or column to a smaller sub problem where the visual fields are ( s , 1 ) . t or s . ( t , 1 ) , respectively . This means that the visual field ( s , 1 ) . t enhances to the visual field s . t by adding a new row and that s . ( t , 1 ) to that s . t by a new column . Moreover , an option exists whether a new boundary arises or not in the new added row or column . Therefore , a sub problem originates in four smaller sub problems , and its CDP[s ; t ; g ; h ] is obtained from those of the smaller subproblems . formula as CDP[s ; t ; g ; h ] = minfE1 ; E2 ; E3 ; E4g , where E1 = CDP[s , 1 ; t ; g ; h ] + t∑ ( , log(P ( xi(s ; v)j(i;s;v) ) ) ) E2 = CDP[s , 1 ; t ; g , 1 ; h ] , log(P ( y(i ) (

6 . PROPOSED HIERARCHICAL CLUSTER
ING ALGORITHM
We introduce the detailed algorithm of our proposed bottom up hierarchical clustering method ( BHCM ) . An initial condition of BHCM is that the visual field of each glaucoma eye is considered to be one cluster , ie , the number of clusters is the same as that of visual fields in the dataset . We merge these clusters based on the MDL principle , ie , we merge some clusters into others to achieve minimum code length . Note that our BHCM tolerates slight differences in the positions of the boundaries between clusters . We realized this by modeling the boundary positions using probabilistic distributions . If some boundaries are similar and should be merged into the same cluster , the code length of our model will be shorter when these boundaries are generated by the same distribution than when they are generated by different distributions . On the contrary , for different boundaries , the code length of our model is longer when both boundaries have been generated by the same distribution than when they have been generated by different distributions .
First , we choose a cluster C1 with minimum value of SCC from a set of size one clusters . Note that clusters previously chosen are never chosen again . Second , we obtain SCC as CS1 . Third , we obtain SCC as CS2 for the case where C1 and another cluster , C2 , are merged . If CS2 is shorter than CS1 , we merge C2 into C1 in the fourth step . All clusters except C1 are checked through this process . Fourth , we merge C1 and the clusters selected in the third step . We repeat this procedure until no cluster can be selected . We choose the cluster with the minimum code length because such a cluster strongly expresses direct product structures , and thus is a reasonable selection as representative of the final cluster .
A benefit of our proposed method is its small time complexity . This is effected by merging clusters all at once in the fourth step . For ordinal bottom up hierarchical clustering methods , a cluster is merged to only one other cluster . This is the key to applying bottom up hierarchical clustering to analyses of glaucoma datasets .
7 . EXPERIMENT USING ARTIFICIAL DATA
In this section , we compare the performance of our proposed method with several other methods for using three progressive patterns of artificial data . We generated artificial data with three patterns : direct product pattern , tree pattern , and step pattern ( see Figure 5 ) . 7.1 Generating Artificial Data
We show how to generate the artificial data . The data structure is constructed as similar to glaucoma data , ie , the artificial data has direct product structure and is divided into several regions . Based on this condition , Our manner of generating each artificial progressive pattern data item was as follows . We first initiated the data as R10.10 , ie , S = T = 10 . We then generated boundaries dividing the regions on the spatial data . We finally generated values of elements within each region from the normal distribution of which parameters are given based on corresponding regions . We divided the spacial data into 3.3 regions with bound2 aries . The boundary positions were denoted by y(i ) Z4 of the ith data . They were set to y(i ) row(2 ) = minfZ1 ; Z2g ; y(i ) row(4 ) = 10 , where Z1 and Z2 were given as Z1 = ⌊(3 + Z)⌋ and Z2 = ⌊(6 + Z)⌋ . Note that Z was drawn from the normal distribution , with mean 0 and standard deviation 2 , and ⌊a⌋ indicates the integer part of a . If Z1 = Z2 , we redraw them . The same procedure was repeated in the case of columns . row(3 ) = maxfZ1 ; Z2g , and y(i ) row(1 ) = 0 ; y(i ) row ; y(i ) col
Generated data has three types of progressive patterns : direct product pattern , tree pattern , and step pattern . Note that tree and step patterns were generated by merging some regions ( see Figure 5(b ) , ( c) ) . Values of data were given by the normal distribution . Its means were defined for each region as Figure 5 and SDs were all set to 1 . We prepared 40 spacial data with the same condition and considered them as a cluster . For each pattern , we generated three clusters , ie , we had 120 spacial data for each progressive pattern . 7.2 Comparative Methods
We introduce comparative methods in this section . A comparative method is defined as a pair of a clustering method and data inputted to the clustering method .
We prepared three types of inputted data as raw data ( RAW ) , smoothing data ( SMO ) , and HOG[4 ] . When we input the data without change , we call it RAW . In SMO , each element of spacial data is exchanged for the averaged values of the five points : the point itself and the neighboring four points , ie SMO gives local space information . HOG is a feature mainly used in image processing , and is useful for

For clustering methods , we used Gaussian mixture models with Laplacian regularization ( LAP ) [ 7 ] , Gaussian mixture ) models ( GMM ) , and k means clustering . We first introduce LAP . Let xi 2 Rd denotes the ith spacial data , where d = S . T = 100 . Then , the similarity matrix S 2 RN.N among spacial data is S(i ; j ) = exp , where D(u ; v ) = 1=(dist(u ; v)+1 ) : Note that dist(u ; v ) is the Euclidean distance between the uth point and vth point . We set the hyperparameter to 10d as in [ 7 ] . For these three clustering methods , we set the number of clusters to three which is the true number of clusters . Note that our proposed method automatically determined the number of clusters .
The eight comparative methods are summarized as follows : ( RAW + k means ) , ( RAW + GMM ) , ( RAW + LAP ) , ( SMO + k means ) , ( SMO + GMM ) , ( SMO + LAP ) , ( HOG + k means ) , and ( HOG + GMM ) . 7.3 Evaluation Indices of Clustering
Four evaluation indices of clustering are introduced in this section . We denote a set of spacial data correctly belonging to the ith cluster by Li , a set of those belonging to the jth cluster by Cj , and N is the number of data items ( N = 120 ) . We define Prec(Li ; Cj ) := and Rec(Li ; Cj ) = jLi\Cjj
N maxi fPrec(Li ; Cj)g jCjj N maxj fRec(Li ; Cj)g[1 ] . The FjLij N maxj fF ( Li ; Cj)g , jLij and InversePurity as measure is defined as F measure = where F ( Li ; Cj ) = 2Prec(Li ; Cj)Rec(Li ; Cj)=(Prec(Li ; Cj)+ Rec(Li ; Cj ) ) [ 5 ] . Then , Normalized mutual information ( NMI )

N indices were within the range [ 0 ; 1 ] , which indicates that the cluster was precise with high values . 7.4 Results
In our method , we employed the normal distribution as described in Eqs . ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , and ( 6 ) . We set ( ff ; fi ) to ( 8 ; 8 ) in Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and ( 10 ; 8 ) in Eq ( 6 ) . The size of regions ( G . H ) was chosen as that giving the shortest code length from ( G ; H ) = f(2 ; 2 ) ; ( 2 ; 3 ) ; ( 3 ; 2 ) ; ( 3 ; 3 ) ; ( 3 ; 4 ) ; ( 4 ; 3 ) ; ( 4 ; 4)g . As a result , we chose ( G ; H ) as ( 3 ; 3 ) for direct product pat

The medians of the evaluation indices of clustering are shown in Figure 6 . Our method outperformed all methods in direct product and tree patterns but does not in step pattern . This showed that our method suits the direct product structure like glaucoma special pattern . On the contrary , for the step pattern , they are quite different from the direct product structure , therefore , our method did not work well .
8 . EXPERIMENTS INVOLVING VISUAL FIELD DATA FROM REAL GLAUCOMA PATIENTS
8.1 Details of the Dataset
The glaucoma dataset used in this paper was provided by the Department of Ophthalmology , The University of Tokyo . The dataset was composed of diagnoses of 1,086 eyes . Although each eye was diagnosed several times , we selected the visual field data from the initial diagnosis . Therefore , we clustered 1,086 visual field data items . 8.2 Results of Clustering
We employed the normal distribution and determined ( G ; H ) as ( 2 ; 2 ) as in the case of artificial data . We set ( ff ; fi ) to ( 8 ; 8 ) in Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , and ( 12 ; 8 ) in Eq ( 6 ) . The code length with ( G ; H ) is summarized in Table 2 .
Our method determined the number of clusters as seven . The progressive patterns of these clusters and sizes of clusters are shown in Figure 7 . The progressive patterns are generated by weighted averaging visual field data within each cluster . We omit the details due to the space limitation . Note that we show the values of only 74 local points on the visual field which corresponds to actual diagnosis points ( see Fig 1(a) ) . We also note that the size of cluster # 7 was only one , therefore , we should consider it as an outlier .
We present the results of the comparative method SMO+GMM .
As the comparative method , we employed SMO as input data and GMM for clustering method because this combination performed well on artificial data . We set the number of clusters in GMM to six in keeping with the number of meaningful clusters in our method . The progressive patterns and the sizes of clusters of the comparative method are shown in Figure 8 . Each progressive pattern was generated by averaging the visual field data within a cluster .
Here , we show the comparison result of our method and SMO+GMM . Table 3 is a cross table : The ( i ; j)th element of this table represents the number of visual field data items belonging to the ith cluster in our proposed method and the jth cluster in SMO+GMM . We can find the significance information in the following four points .
First , our method clearly divides a complex cluster generated by SMO+GMM into two simple clusters . As shown in Table 3 , members of the cluster # 5 in SMO+GMM are divided into the clusters # 5 and # 6 in our method . For the clusters # 5 and # 6 in our method , damages of the

( f ) #6 59 . progressive patterns are on upper and lower area , respectively ( Figure 7(e),(f) ) . On the contrary , for the clusters # 5 in SMO+GMM , damages entirely spread on the visual field . This difference indicates that our proposed method can capture the two different progressive patterns .
Second , our method can sensitively detect the difference of progression stage . As similar to the first point , members of the cluster # 2 in SMO+GMM are divided into the clusters # 1 and # 2 in our method . For the cluster # 2 in SMO+GMM , damages of the progressive pattern are unclear ( Figure 8(b) ) . In our method , however , damages of

Third , our method detects the progressive patterns spreading the lower area . For the cluster # 6 in our method ( Figure 7(f) ) , the damages on the visual field clearly shown in the lower area . On the contrary , for the cluster # 3 in SMO+GMM ( Figure 8(c) ) , the damages within the lower area are not so clear . This suggests that our method gathered visual field damaged in the lower area more correctly . Fourth , our method shows the progressive patterns which agrees with the clinical knowledge . Glaucomatous visual field defect usually starts with nasal step ( Figure 7(a ) ) and/or Bjerrum scotoma . Nasal step and Bjerrum scotoma are the names of areas in the visual field . As the disease progresses these defects expand and can be merged to each other ( Figure 7(b ) , ( d ) , ( f) ) . With the further advancement , hemifield loss in superior or inferior visual field can be observed ( Figure 7(c ) ) sometimes excluding points which are adjacent to a horizontal line ( Figure 7(e) ) . Thus , we see the time evolution of progressive patterns . On the contrary , it is hard to find such time evolution for the clusters of SMO+GMM . 8.3 Predicting Progression of Glaucoma
In this section , we apply our clustering method to the prediction problem of future progression of glaucoma . It is known that damages caused by glaucoma do not recover , therefore , initial treatments to alleviate the progression of glaucoma are seriously important . From this viewpoint , accurate prediction using a few measurements is strongly desired and investigated by many studies [ 10 , 12 , 13 ] .
We introduce Liang et al . ’s work [ 10 ] to use it as an example for the applications of our clustering results into the prediction problem . Recently , Liang et al . [ 10 ] proposed a clustering based prediction method . This method gathers patients who are similar to the target patient using spatiotemporal clustering , and generates a predictor by fitting them to a linear function of time . Thus , by exchanging their clusters for our clusters , we can evaluate the effects of our clustering results on the prediction problem of glaucoma .
Here , we show the settings of our comparison . As the comparative method , we employed the uv em clustering method and the temporal shift linear regression ( TSLR ) because this combination performed well [ 10 ] . The number of clusters of uv em was set to 40 based on [ 10 ] . The performance of prediction is measured by the root mean squared error ( RMSE ) defined as dicted and actual TD on the ith local point on the visual i=1(^yi , yi)2=74 , where ^yi and yi are the pre

We note that our clusters were generated using only first diagnosis data without use of time information . We compared RMSE of both methods varying Q 2 [ 2 : 9 ] through 10 fold cross validation . As shown in Figure 9 , our clustering results gave more accurate prediction than the comparative method in the sense of median for Q = 2 and 3 . Moreover , we counted the number of wins of our method as summarized in Table 4 . For Q = 2 and 3 , our method was significantly better than the comparative method with p < 0:05 . To check the significance of this result , we conducted a binomial test with a null hypotheses that predictive abilities are equal for both methods . For Q 4 , the null hypotheses cannot be rejected . This results imply that our clustering contains helpful information for prediction problem .
9 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper , we proposed a bottom up hierarchical clustering method to embed specific features of the visual field data from glaucoma patients into a model . Our method classifies the visual field data into several clusters based on the code length of the dataset . Under the MDL principle , optimal clusters are selected .
Our proposed method has performed well for an artificial dataset . In the cases involving the artificial dataset with direct product and tree patterns , our method has exhibited the best performance in comparative experiments . However ,

Using a real dataset of glaucoma , our method detected the characteristic progressive patterns . This result agrees with clinical knowledge of glaucoma progression . Moreover , we entered our clustering results into a prediction method based on spatio temporal clustering , and found that prediction performance improved when our clusters were used . This implies that our clusters contain not only characteristic patterns , but also richer information that can extend our method to treat general problems in glaucoma .
In future research , we will investigate the capabilities of our method to provide more information for glaucoma treatment . With a larger patient dataset , we think that our method can provide more detailed features of the progressive patterns of glaucoma . This is supported by the automatic decision regarding the number of clusters in our method . Regardless of the size of the dataset , our method generates suitably sized clusters . Furthermore , our clustering results may be able to contribute to providing classification of glaucoma patients . By combining clustering results in large datasets with other information , such as risk factors , we may obtain deeper knowledge of glaucoma . This will contribute to the treatment of the glaucoma .
