ABSTRACT Acute hospital care as performed in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) is characterized by its frequent , but short term interventions for patients who are severely ill . Because clinicians have to attend to more than one patient at a time and make decisions in a limited time in acute hospital care environments , the accurate prediction of the in hospital mortality risk could assist them to pay more attention to patients with a higher in hospital mortality risk , thereby improving the quality and efficiency of the care . One of the salient features of ICU is the diversity of patients : clinicians are faced by patients with a wide variety of diseases . However , mortality prediction for ICU patients has typically been conducted by building one common predictive model for all the diseases . In this paper , we incorporate disease specific contexts into mortality modeling by formulating the mortality prediction problem as a multi task learning problem in which a task corresponds to a disease . Our method effectively integrates medical domain knowledge relating to the similarity among diseases and the similarity among Electronic Health Records ( EHRs ) into a data driven approach by incorporating graph Laplacians into the regularization term to encode these similarities . The experimental results on a real dataset from a hospital corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed method . The AUCs of several baselines were improved , including logistic regression without multi task learning and several multi task learning methods that do not incorporate the domain knowledge . In addition , we illustrate some interesting results pertaining to diseasespecific predictive features , some of which are not only consistent with existing medical domain knowledge , but also contain suggestive hypotheses that could be validated by further investigations in the medical domain .

INTRODUCTION
The accurate assessment of patient severity is crucial for clinicians to plan appropriate care and to manage patient health . In acute settings , such as intensive care unit ( ICU ) , mortality risk is often used as a surrogate to describe the severity of patients’ conditions . Because clinicians have to attend to more than one patient at a time and have limited time for making decisions in acute settings , the ability to accurately forecast in hospital mortality risk stands to greatly improve the quality of acute hospital care , which can lead to reducing the number of preventable deaths . In fact , several studies report that a certain number of the deaths of patients who underwent ICU were considered potentially avoidable [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , suggesting the need for early recognition of mortality risk and appropriate treatment . In this context , research has been conducted to develop predictive models of mortality risk for patients who underwent ICU treatment [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 ] .
One of the factors that makes ICU an especially challenging environment is the diversity of patients , which means that clinicians are faced with a heterogeneous group of patients at any time with a wide variety of diseases . This is in contrast to the other situations in which clinicians face patients with similar diseases in a specific treatment department . Then , information about ICU patients , such as their vital signs and medications , is obtained from varied data sources . Within this setting , however , mortality risk prediction for ICU patients is typically made by constructing one common predictive model for all the diseases [ 6 , 8 , 9 ] . Yet , each disease may have a specific prediction rule that explains the mortality risk . For instance , stomach medicine can be used for patients with diseases that are accompanied with artificial respiration to prevent gastric ulcer because artificial respiration often causes gastric ulcer . On the other hand , it can be also used to remedy severe gastric ulcer with bleeding . The corresponding prediction rule would be varied depending on which type of the diseases the patient has .
This kind of disease specific context is an implicit assumption in other predictive modeling environments , such as hospital re admission prediction [ 10 , 11 ] and disease progression predic

Most of the diseases only have a few patients . tion [ 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 ] , where a model specialized to a target disease is learned with the assumption that the target disease is given or specified beforehand . In these cases , it is assumed that the dataset consists of only patients with the specified target disease ; to begin with , it is not assumed to learn models for multiple different diseases simultaneously . However , ICU patients are composed of heterogeneous patients with a variety of diseases , which calls for mortality modeling with considering the disease specific contexts . Consequently , by customizing the model for each disease , the predictive modeling of mortality risk would be improved , thereby enhancing the quality and efficiency of acute clinical care . Challenge : data scarcity and data sparsity Despite the importance of in hospital mortality risk prediction in acute hospital care , data scarcity and data sparsity pose a significant challenge for the disease based customization : ( 1 ) data scarcity resulting from the customization and ( 2 ) data sparseness associated with electronic health records ( EHRs ) .
( 1 ) Data scarcity resulting from the customization .
Attempts to build a customized model for each disease are complicated by the limited availability of sufficiently large datasets , because many diseases only have a small number of patients .
To illustrate this , in Figure 1 we show a disease patients distribution plot of an ICU dataset , of which the data was collected from about 170 hospitals in Japan , and which consists of about 200,000 patients who underwent ICU treatment . The patients were discharged from their hospital from April , 2010 to March , 2013 . The horizontal axis represents the disease indices . The disease indices are made based on the four digit ICD 10 codes ( International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10 codes ) . The vertical axis represents the corresponding number of patients . The plot shows that most of the diseases only have a few patients . More specifically , about 80 % of the diseases have fewer than 30 patients , although the total number of patients is about 200,000 . The sparsity is still observed even when we adopt a more coarse classification of diseases ( at the third level of ICD10 hierarchy ) . As a result , naive customization according to each disease fails due to the scarcity of data .
( 2 ) Data sparseness associated with electronic health records
( EHRs ) . Another kind of sparsity is associated with the availability of electronic health records ( EHRs ) . In mortality modeling , each patient

We define the similarities among diseases from the hierarchical structure to jointly learn prediction models for different diseases using a multi task learning method . is typically represented using EHRs that describe patients’ information , such as demographic information , clinical history , medications , and lab tests . However , raw EHRs are extremely sparse [ 16 ] , and this also applies to ICU cases . One reason behind this sparsity is the fact that a significant number of EHRs are subject to medical classification , which categorizes medical information from multiple viewpoints , producing highly fine grained features . One example is the categorization of medicines , which could be done in terms of drug efficacy , ingredients , form of the drug , pharmaceutical manufacturer , etc . , and if two medicines are different from one point of view ( such as their ingredients ) , then the raw codes of the two medicines will be totally different . However , the fact that the two medicines share all their other properties , including drug efficacy , suggests that those medicines might have similar roles in predicting patient risk . Consequently , it would be desirable to incorporate these similarities in EHRs .
Proposed solution : multi task learning with medical domain knowledge To address the above mentioned challenges , we propose a method that effectively integrates medical domain knowledge into a datadriven approach by using multi task learning ( MTL ) [ 17 , 18 , 19 ] . In our formulation , a task corresponds to a disease and prediction tasks for different types of diseases are jointly solved by sharing information across the diseases . The key issue in formulating the mortality prediction as a multi task learning problem is how to relate different kinds of diseases to share information among them . To appropriately model the relationships among diseases , we exploit domain knowledge about the medical classification of diseases such as the ICD hierarchy . ICD is a widely used classification of diseases that is maintained by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . In this hierarchical classification , diseases are categorized in terms of cause , symptoms , morphological disparity , etc . , encoding important information that affects the mortality risk . Figure 2 illustrates a multi task learning formulation based on the ICD 10 hierarchy . In this formulation , patients with the same kind of disease , which is defined by the third level of ICD 10 hierarchy , are grouped together into a task . Then the information about the extent to which diseases are related , or are similar , can be obtained by exploiting the hierarchical structure . We integrate this medical domain knowledge by incorporating a graph Laplacian that encodes the similarities among diseases into the regularization term in the

To integrate medical domain knowledge , we introduce a cross regularization into the multi task learning formulation , where medical domain knowledge is integrated by two graph Laplacians that encode similarities among diseases and similarities among EHRs , respectively . In our cross regularization framework , the model parameters of diseases and features are both regularized simultaneously .
• We empirically evaluate our proposed method by employing it in a in hospital mortality prediction problem using a real ICU dataset collected from a hospital in Japan . The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several baselines including logistic regression without multitask learning and several multi task learning methods which do not incorporate the domain knowledge . In addition to the predictive performance , we examine whether the extracted disease specific predictive features are interpretable by our medical experts . The close and in depth reviews of the obtained models that are provided by the domain experts revealed some suggestive disease specific predictive features .

RISK MODELING
We consider disease dependent mortality risk modeling where each disease has a separate model specialized to it in order to incorporate disease specific contexts .

Let T denote the number of diseases . A mortality risk prediction model is constructed for each disease . The t th disease has Nt patients and the n th patient with the t th disease is associn derived from the ated with an M dimensional feature vector φ(t ) Electronic Health Records ( EHRs ) . We create an Nt × M design matrix for the t th disease : Φ(t ) ≡ [ φ(t ) ] . Each patient is associated with a binary class label . Let yt,n ∈ {0 , 1} denote the class label for the n th patient with the t th disease where yt,n = 1 when the patient outcome is death and yt,n = 0 otherwise . We create an Nt dimensional response vector for the t th disease : y(t ) ≡ ( yt,1 , yt,2 , . . . , yt,Nt ) . Because we are interested in the probability of mortality risk , we adopt logistic regression and represent the posterior probability of the outcome of patient n being death as Pr[yt,n = 1|φ(t ) n ) , where σ(a ) is the sigmoid function : σ(a ) ≡ ( 1 + exp(−a))−1 and w(t ) is an M dimensional model parameter vector for the t th disease . n ] = σ(w(t)T

The regularizations are incorporated to encourage the models to respect the domain knowledge such as the relationships among diseases defined in medical domain .
We assume domain knowledge about similarities among diseases and similarities among features are available , which are encoded as symmetric similarity matrices Sdz and Sfeat , respectively . Sdz(i , j ) is the similarity between i th and j th diseases , and Sfeat(i , j ) is the similarity between i th and j th features . Note that the similarity matrix can be any symmetric matrix whose elements are positive real number . Notations and their descriptions are summarized in Table 1 .

CROSS REGULARIZED MULTI TASK

L(W ) ≡ − T
Nt
We define the loss function as the log loss denoted by L(W ) :
{yt,n log σ(w(t ) φ(t ) n ) + ( 1 − yt,n ) log(1 − σ(w(t ) n ))} , φ(t ) n t
( 1 ) where σ(a ) is the sigmoid function . In addition to the loss function , we include the regularization term Ω in our objective function to incorporate the domain knowledge . The optimization problem is defined as follows :
L(W ) + Ω(W ) , min W
( 2 ) where Ω is a regularization term that is used to avoid overfitting and to incorporate domain knowledge .
Here , we exploit our domain knowledge about the similarities among diseases and features as the following regularization terms : fifififififi fifififififi2 fifififififi fifififififi2

The symmetric normalized Laplacian of an undirected graph with an adjacency matrix A is defined as D−1/2(D−A)D−1/2 , where D is a diagonal matrix of which the ( i , i) th element is defined as j Sdz
Di,i ≡ j Ai,j .
The regularization term Ωdz(W ) works for making the two model parameters W ∗,i and W ∗,j similar if two diseases i and j are similar in terms of the medical classifications given as the similarity matrix Sdz . Similarly , the regularization term Ωfeat(W ) works for making the two model parameters W i,∗ and W j,∗ similar if two features i and j are similar in terms of the clinical classifications given as the similarity matrix Sfeat . Since both of the rows and the columns of W are regularized using the two Laplacians Ldz and Lfeat , we call this regularization cross regularization . Figure 3 depicts our proposed cross regularization framework .
As a whole , we adopt the following regularization term : Ω(W ) ≡ λdzΩdz(W ) + λfeatΩfeat(W ) + λridΩrid(W ) ,
( 5 ) where Ωrid(W ) ≡ 1 2 Tr(W W ) is the standard ridge regularization term used to avoid overfitting , and λdz ≥ 0 , λfeat ≥ 0 and λrid ≥ 0 are hyperparameters used to tune the weight of the regularization terms Ωdz , Ωfeat , and Ωrid , respectively .
Since Laplacian matrices are positive semidefinite , the regularization term is convex as well as the loss function ; hence the optimal solution of the optimization problem is found by using standard gradient based methods . We applied the L BFGS optimizer [ 20 ] with the following derivatives :

4 . EMPIRICAL STUDY
In this section , we empirically evaluate our proposed method by employing it in a in hospital mortality prediction problem using a real ICU dataset collected from a hospital in Japan . In addition to the predictive performance , we examine whether the extracted disease specific predictive features are interpretable by our medical experts . In summary , the extracted disease specific features were interpretable by our medical experts and included some suggestive hypotheses as well as findings consistent with existing medical domain knowledge . 4.1 Experimental Setups
Dataset and pre processing
We used a dataset from a hospital obtained from the Quality Indicator/Improvement Project ( QIP ) 1 , which is administered by the Department of Healthcare Economics and Quality Management , Kyoto University [ 21 ] . Hospitals that voluntarily participated in this project provided their clinical data for analyses . Our dataset consists of 1 , 136 patients who underwent ICU treatment at some point in their hospital stay . The patients were discharged from the hospital during the period April , 2010 to March , 2013 . As the unit of the disease ( task ) , we used the main disease that made the patient being admitted to the hospital , which was coded by the third level of the ICD 10 hierarchy . After excluding patients under 18 and patients with a disease with fewer than 10 patients , we obtained 701 patients and 20 diseases for our study . The codes and names of the diseases that were used in our study are listed in Table 2 . The number of patients ( cases ) and the death rate for each disease are shown in Figure 4 . As the measure of mortality , we adopted inhospital mortality ; if a patient died in his hospital stay , the patient outcome is “ death" and otherwise “ survival" . The age and gender of each patient were extracted and we made two binary features : “ Over 65" for the age and “ Men" for gender . We also included the main disease and all the comorbidities of the patient , which are coded by the fourth level of the ICD 10 hierarchy into our features . Additionally , we extracted all the medical events for which patients were billed during their hospital stay . These events mainly describe patient interventions such as medication , operative treatment , and laboratory tests that are coded by the Diagnosis Procedure Combination ( DPC ) system , which is a system used for medical billing in Japan . Regarding these medical events , we did not conduct any feature engineering ; we used all the raw codes in the DPC system as our features , and if a patient received an intervention once or more than once , the corresponding feature was set to 1 , otherwise 0 .

Creation of similarity matrix
Using the above mentioned information , we created the similarity matrix Sfeat in Eq 4 based on the following rules : if the intervention is medication and if two medicines have the same drug efficacy , then the similarity between them is set to 1 , otherwise 0 . We detail the reason of this choice below . From the raw code of a medicine , we were able to recover information about its efficacy , ingredients , and form of the drug . Among them , form of the drug was considered irrelevant to the mortality . In addition , there are a certain number of medicines with common ingredients but different efficacy , and we considered these medicines do not necessarily play similar roles in mortality prediction . On the other hand , medicines with same efficacy are considered to play similar roles in mortality prediction even if their ingredients are different ; medicines with different ingredients are used to remedy a same disease by different mechanisms . Hence , we considered the following two patterns for our choice : ( 1 ) medicines with common efficacy but different ingredients become similar , and ( 2 ) medicines with common ingredients and efficacy become similar . However , when we choose ( 2 ) , the similarity matrix became sparse in our experiment . Therefore , we considered the choice ( 1 ) was a more balanced choice , which realizes both sufficiency and appropriateness of the domain knowledge . In regard to the similarities among diseases ( tasks ) , we created the similarity matrix Sdz in Eq 3 based on the following rule : the similarity of two diseases is defined as the number of shared levels in the ICD hierarchy . The overall structure of our ICD hierarchy can be considered a tree and one reasonable measure of similarity between nodes in a tree is the shared number of ascendants . Hence , we adopted the number of shared levels in the ICD hierarchy as the similarity between two diseases .
Prediction setting
We randomly sampled 60 % of the patients for training and reserved the remaining 40 % for evaluation . All the hyperparameters of both our proposed method and compared methods were tuned via 3 fold cross validation in the training dataset . For our

For compared methods , all the hyperparameters were tuned among {0 , 10−5 , 10−4 , 10−3 , 10−2 , 10−1 , 100} . We repeated the procedure of sampling , prediction and evaluation 20 times . The following three prediction settings were considered : ( 1 ) outcome prediction before ICU discharge ( 2 days before ) , ( 2 ) outcome prediction before ICU discharge ( 1 day before ) , and ( 3 ) retrospective outcome prediction . For the first setting , we used all the features associated with the patient that are available 2 days before the day they were discharged from the ICU . For the second setting , we used all the features associated with the patient that are available before the day they were discharged from the ICU . For the third setting , we used all the features associated with the patient that were available before the day they were discharged from the hospital . The total number of the features is 2 , 026 , 2 , 077 , and 2 , 549 in the first , second , third setting , respectively . As an evaluation measure for predictive performance , we adopted the area under the ROC curve ( AUC ) , which is widely used because it does not depend on the decision threshold for the probability of positives or negatives and also does not depend on the class balance .
Compared methods
Table 3 contains a comparison of the various methods that were used in our study . The effect of incorporating the domain knowledge about the classification of diseases and medical features was evaluated by using two variants of our proposed method : the method Proposed feat is identical to our proposed method with λdz = 0 in Eq 5 , and Proposed dz is identical to our proposed method with λfeat = 0 in Eq 5 . We also compared our method with logistic regression without multi task learning . The method nonMTL 1 ( separate ) learns separate models for each disease without considering relationships among tasks or features . non MTL2 ( common ) is a logistic regression with 2 norm regularization . This method learns one common model applicable to all the diseases . For multi task learning baselines , we prepared the following two multi task learning methods . The first of these methods , MTL1 ( 2,1 ) [ 19 ] , incorporates 2,1 norm regularization , which introduces group sparsity and can be considered as a joint feature selection across tasks . The 2,1 norm of a matrix W is defined as i ||W i,∗||2 , where 2 norm of a vector w is defined i ||wi||2 ) 2 . The second of these methods is MTL 2 ( Trace ) [ 22 ] , which incorporates trace norm regularization with the assumption that models from different tasks share a common lowdimensional subspace . Both the two multi task learning baselines are based on logistic regression , similar to our proposed method .

4.2 Results and Discussion
421 Predictive Performance Table 4 shows the averaged AUCs of the various methods in the three prediction settings : ( 1 ) outcome prediction before ICU discharge ( 2 days before ) , ( 2 ) outcome prediction before ICU discharge ( 1 day before ) , and ( 3 ) retrospective prediction . In all the settings , our proposed method outperformed all the other methods in terms of AUCs . We conducted the Wilcoxon signed rank test for each pair of our proposed method and compared method , and confirmed that our proposed method statistically significantly ( p < 0.05 ) outperformed all the other methods in each setting , except for the bold faced results ( p ≥ 005 ) In the retrospective prediction setting and the pre ICU discharge prediction setting ( 1 day before ) , the proposed method outperformed all the other methods with p < 0.05 , except for Proposed dz . In the pre ICU discharge prediction setting ( 2 days before ) , the proposed method outperformed all the other methods with p < 0.05 , except for the nonMTL 2 ( common ) . Because the amount of data that is available for prediction 2 days before ICU discharge is less than that available 1 day before ICU discharge or hospital discharge , the above result suggests that the incorporation of the domain knowledge about EHRs is effective when data is comparatively sparse .
From Table 4 , we obtain the following observations : • Although multi task learning does not necessarily improve the predictive performance , the appropriate incorporation of task relatedness , ie , how each disease relates to others , can improve the predictive performance significantly .
• Incorporation of domain knowledge about medical classification of EHRs can also contribute to the improvement of predictive performance when data is sparse .
422 Predictive features for each disease Interventions not only change the course of disease , but also reflect the clinician ’s assessment of a patients’ status ; ie , the clinician ’s assessment of the severity of the illness . In this section , we illustrate disease specific predictive features that reflect how the interventions progress as well as other suggestive features .
Table 5 lists the top 15 features with positive coefficients for each disease and Table 6 lists the top 15 features with negative coefficients for each disease . All the results presented here are averaged results based on the 20 samples in the pre ICU discharge prediction setting ( 1 day before ) . We illustrate several suggestive features with positive coefficients below .
1 . Exam repetition ( CT , MRI ) in disease category K :
This code is used when clinicians conduct the specified inspection ( CT , MRI ) more than once a month on a particular patient . When this code is used , the government pays only a part of the fee associated with this inspection , based on the underlying assumption that clinicians are not required to conduct these inspections more than once a month if they decide to carry out a proper examination . When this code is used , the clinicians repeat the same inspection even though they effectively have to pay a penalty . This suggests situations in which the treatment does not progress as expected or situations where clinicians have difficulty in making a diagnosis . 2 . Nucleic acid identification of Mycobacterium group in N18 :
This test is not directly related to the disease N18 : Chronic kidney disease . Because N18 refers to a diagnosis that is made when the clinicians admitted the patient , this suggests a situation in which the clinicians have difficulty in diagnosing the patient , and are therefore conducting an alternative test to give a diagnosis .
3 . Rehabilitation for cardiovascular disease in disease category
I : This intervention is a discriminative intervention for the disease category I : Diseases of the circulatory system . Since some interventions are conducted only for a particular disease , learning disease specific prediction rules is expected to be effective for mortality risk prediction in ICU .
4 . Comorbidities :
The main disease and all the comorbidities of the patient are included into our features , and their ICD codes are marked with “ [ I]" in Table 5 and Table 6 . We can see that the high risk comorbidities vary depending on the main disease . We can also see that many of the comorbidities that ranked in the top 15 features with positive coefficients include the term “ unspecified" and “ other" in their names . This might reflect situations in which patients with comorbidities that are difficult to make a diagnosis have higher mortality risks .
Note that such disease specific analyses are available for the first time by our proposed method . Note also that the above mentioned suggestive hypotheses could be validated by conducting further investigations in the medical domain .
5 . RELATED WORK 5.1 Mortality Modeling
Traditional methods for mortality modeling are based on scoring systems such as the Simplified Acute Physiology Score ( SAPS ) that use fixed clinical decision rules by mainly using physiological data [ 23 ] . However , it is pointed out that these ICU scoring systems are only used for a few patients , namely , 10 % to 15 % of US ICU patients [ 24 ] as of 2012 . As information of a more varied , time evolving nature became available as a form of EHR such as clinical notes and intervention records , data driven predictive modeling has been explored extensively in recent years [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 25 ] . Many of these studies can be viewed as feature engineering . Caleb and Peter [ 4 ] conducted exhaustive feature engineering to explore the feasibility of real time mortality risk prediction by using various nurse charted observations , such as vital signs , lab results , and medications , as well as several carefully designed features that were suggested by the medical literature as being useful for prediction purpose . The use of unstructured information , ie , clinical notes has been explored in recent years ; for example , Lehman [ 25 ] et al . applied hierarchical Dirichlet processes to unstructured clinical notes to develop risk stratifications for ICU patients . Ghassemi et al . [ 6 ] examined the use of latent variable models to obtain meaningful features from unstructured clinical notes . Both of the papers reported that the features extracted from the clinical notes were predictive yet interpretable . Another direction that has recently been explored is time series modeling ; for instance , Ghassemi et al . [ 8 ] examined the use of time series modeling via multi task Gaussian process to forecast the severity of illness in ICU patients .

However , the disease specific context has not been considered to an adequate extent , although it is undoubtedly a significant matter . In fact , Sionitis et al . [ 23 ] pointed out in his review of 94 studies relating to ICU mortality modeling that there was a large variability of prediction accuracy across various diseases and population subgroups . To the best of our knowledge , our work is the first that formulates the ICU mortality risk prediction problem as a multitask learning in which a task corresponds to a disease , thereby incorporating disease specific contexts into the predictive modeling of mortality .
5.2 Multi task Learning
Problems for Health care
Multi task learning has been explored extensively for health care problems , including disease progression models [ 13 , 14 ] , prediction of clinical variables [ 26 ] , patient outcome prediction [ 11 ] , and forecasting of the severity of illness in ICU [ 8 ] . Zhou et al . [ 13 , 14 ] proposed a temporal group Lasso regularizer to encourage temporal smoothness of the predictive models across different time points . Quanz and Huan [ 26 ] applied multi task feature selection to a set of images obtained from different sources , such as MRI and PET , extracting a common subset of features for different tasks . Gupta et al . [ 11 ] exploited hierarchical Dirichlet process to learn specific models for each group of interventions . Ghassemi et al . [ 8 ] examined the use of multivariate time series modeling with the multitask Gaussian process to forecast the severity of illnesses of patients in ICU , where a specific period of time corresponds to a task .
However , none of the above mentioned studies considers disease as the unit of the task . One exception is the recent work by Wang et al . [ 27 ] where the authors formulate the disease onset risk prediction for patients with multiple diseases as a multi task learning . Our work is different from their work in that our method is capable of incorporating domain knowledge into data driven approaches . Although we exploited ICD 10 and drug efficacy information as the domain knowledge in our experiments , our method can incorporate any prior knowledge encoded as similarity matrices ; disease similarities and similarities between EHRs can be constructed by using prior knowledge from domain experts or by leveraging multiple other information sources . One important future direction would be to explore how to construct such disease similarities and similarities between EHRs [ 28 ] . In addition , our work differs from other works in that we incorporate the similarities between both the tasks ( diseases ) and features derived from EHRs simultaneously by using graph Laplacians , which results in the cross regularization in multitask learning framework . Although the feature regularizer has been explored in single task learning to capture intrinsic relationships among features [ 29 ] , it has not been explored in multi task learning . In addition , although a cross regularization has been proposed for semi supervised multi label learning [ 30 ] , where two graphs are initially constructed on instance levels and category levels to incorporate the instance similarities and the category similarities , it has not been explored in multi task learning .
6 . CONCLUSION
Our study considered disease specific contexts in mortality modeling in acute hospital care , for which we formulated mortality prediction in terms of multi task learning where a task corresponds to a disease . Our method effectively incorporated domain knowledge about the medical classification of both diseases and EHRs into a data driven approach . Experimental results on a real dataset from a hospital demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed method . Our approach incorporated task relatedness , ie , how each disease relates to others , in an appropriate manner , which led to an improvement in the predictive performance . The incorporation of domain knowledge about the medical classification of EHRs was also effective . Furthermore , the results of the analyses of the diseasespecific predictive features not only contained findings consistent with existing medical domain knowledge , but also produced some hypothetical suggestions . Possible explanations for these suggestions are provided by existing medical domain knowledge , which requires further investigations to be actually validated in the medical domain . Our proposed method and results could be effective to enhance the understanding of disease specific contexts as well as to improve the predictive performance in mortality modeling in acute hospital care .
