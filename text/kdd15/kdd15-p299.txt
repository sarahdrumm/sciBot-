ABSTRACT Mixed land use refers to the e↵ort of putting residential , commercial and recreational uses in close proximity to one another . This can contribute economic benefits , support viable public transit , and enhance the perceived security of an area . It is naturally promising to investigate how to rank real estate from the viewpoint of diverse mixed land use , which can be reflected by the portfolio of community functions in the observed area . To that end , in this paper , we develop a geographical function ranking method , named FuncDivRank , by incorporating the functional diversity of communities into real estate appraisal . Specifically , we first design a geographic function learning model to jointly capture the correlations among estate neighborhoods , urban functions , temporal e↵ects , and user mobility patterns . In this way we can learn latent community functions and the corresponding portfolios of estates from human mobility data and Point of Interest ( POI ) data . Then , we learn the estate ranking indicator by simultaneously maximizing ranking consistency and functional diversity , in a unified probabilistic optimization framework . Finally , we conduct a comprehensive evaluation with real world data . The experimental results demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed method for real estate appraisal .

INTRODUCTION
Mixed land use is increasingly popular in the real estate development of big cities . Mixed land use is the combination of multiple compatible land uses , including residential , commercial , and recreational uses within a certain area [ 30 ] . Mixed land use can : ( i ) contribute economic benefits , eg , commercial areas in close proximity to residential areas can increase property values ; ( ii ) support viable public transit ; and ( iii ) enhance the perceived security , eg , by helping increase activity and hence the presence of people on the street . More importantly , a balanced mix of land uses leads to the co location of socio economic functions , and thus yields livable , sustainable , and viable neighborhoods .
Figure 1 : The POI density spectrum of estates over multiple POI categories .
Research literature has developed empirical evidence for the value of mixed land use . Many studies have shown that , in big cities , people value a balanced mix of land uses more than other key indicators of real estate value [ 30 , 19 , 22 ] . A recent study reported that people are willing to pay almost 25 % more for a house in an area with appropriate mixed land use , and one standard deviation increase in diversity increases real estate prices by 100%–425 % [ 19 ] . Indeed , Figure 1 shows the point of interest ( POI ) density spectrum of real estate over multiple POI categories . As can be seen , the spectrum of high ranked estates ( left ) is more evenly balanced than that of low ranked estates ( right ) . The evidence illustrates that investment value of real estate with a balanced mix of neighborhood functions is usually higher than otherwise comparable real estate in mono functional areas .
All the above evidence suggests it is highly appealing to investigate how to rank real estate values based on the functional diversity of land uses . Two unique challenges arise in achieving this goal . First , the community functions and the corresponding portfolios that a↵ect value need to be effectively identified . Second , the relationship between these portfolios and real estate value ranking needs to be modeled . We outline how we tackle these two main challenges next .
First , the impact of mixed use on property values largely depends on the specific composition of land uses . Some functions can increase real estate values , while others may not have significant impact . For instance , manufacturing usually degrades property values . In contrast , more commercial land use , such as entertainment and retail stores , can lead to higher property values . People are generally willing to pay more for uses that are compatible with residential values and less for uses that negatively impact house prices . Therefore , compatible functions should be carefully selected for mixed land use . However , identifying these functions is a nontrivial task . For example , some studies [ 22 ] revealed that , within a certain range , proximity to commercial uses
299 has a negative e↵ect on real estate value . Therefore , the first question arises : how to identify functions that are compatible with real estate values and learn the portfolio of these identified functions in the target community ? Traditionally , real estate professionals use regression analysis to determine the significance and the direction of the relationship between real estate value and functions .
Unlike traditional approaches , we treat these unknown functions as latent factors and learn the portfolio of functions from human mobility data . During di↵erent time periods , there are di↵erent perceived functions in a community , and thus di↵erent patterns can be observed in the human mobility data of the community , which include taxi GPS traces , bus GPS traces , and user check in data . The human mobility patterns in a community jointly reflect the diverse mixtures of neighborhood functions [ 34 ] . For example , on workdays , people generally leave a residential area in the morning and return in the evening . Also , people usually check into entertainment places on workday evenings or during the entire day over weekends . Therefore , in this paper , we exploit human mobility patterns for identifying the latent compatible functions and for learning the portfolio of community functions .
Second , after we learn the portfolio of community functions , we naturally come up with another question : how to evaluate the impact of the distribution of community functions on real estate value ? Traditionally , real estate professionals use a two step paradigm , which first defines entropylike indexes , such as the Hirschmann Herfindahl index , to measure the diversity of community functions , and then includes these indexes into regression models as independent variables [ 19 , 12 ] . However , this paradigm may not be optimal for ranking , because these two steps are independently modeled . Instead , we treat the learned portfolio as the functional spectrum of the estate ranked list over K functions in a listwise manner . For each function k , we calculate the relevance score of the whole estate ranked list conditioned on k . Then , we aggregate the weighted sum of K relevance scores as a measure of functional diversity . Finally , we can jointly model both functional diversity and ranking consistency as a unified estate ranking objective for optimization .
Specifically , in this paper , we first develop a geographic functional learning model to jointly model the interrelationship among estate neighborhoods , urban functions , temporal e↵ects , and mobility patterns for learning the portfolio of functions for each estate ’s neighborhood . In particular , we assume there are K latent functions and treat them as a latent categorical variable . At di↵erent time periods , an estate neighborhood exhibits di↵erent functions due to its particular mix of land uses . Given a specific function and a time period , an estate neighborhood has specific mobility patterns of taxi rides , bus trips , and check ins . Here , we treat these patterns as three types of words in three di↵erent vocabularies ( ie , three di↵erent latent spaces ) . Hence , given a time period , a neighborhood has three clusters of words . We treat each word cluster as a mobility document . By fitting our geographic functional learning model to mobility data , we derive the portfolio of K neighborhood functions for each estate . Next , we incorporate functional diversity to learn an estate ranking indicator . In particular , we extract raw features from urban geography data and human mobility data , learn meta features by decision trees , and linearly regress these features to predict estate investment values .
Moreover , we design a weighted sum function to capture the diversity of neighborhood functions in an estate ranked list . Along these lines , we train an estate ranking indicator by simultaneously maximizing ranking consistency and functional diversity in a unified probabilistic framework . Finally , we have conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation on real world data . The experimental results demonstrate the enhanced performance of the proposed method for real estate evaluation .
2 . THE GEOGRAPHIC FUNCTIONAL RANK
ING FRAMEWORK
In this section , we first formally introduce the problem of geographic functional ranking , and then provide an overview of our ranking framework . 2.1 Problem Statement
Real estate investment value , di↵erent from market value ( ie , price ) , reflects the growth potential of resale value that can be higher or lower than market value to a particular investor . The unique characteristic of investment value motivates investors to enter the real estate marketplace , seek estates with high investment value , and maximize their investment returns . Therefore , the capability to rank estates based on investment ranking is necessary . Essentially , ranking estates is similar to ranking documents with a defined relevance , where an estate is analogized as a document and its investment value is considered as the relevance .
Formally , given a set of of M estates E = {e1 , e2 , , eM} , the goal of our problem is to rank them in a descending order according to their investment values Y = {y1 , y2 , , yM} . In this study , we assume each estate m has a location ( ie , latitude and longitude ) and a neighborhood area ( eg , a circle with radius of 1 km ) , which we call an estate community in this paper . According to the theory of mixed land use , in urban areas of super cities , an estate ’s investment value largely depends on the functional portfolio of its community . In other words , a diverse mixture of community functions usually leads to high investment value of an estate . Indeed , the rankings of estates according to their investment value could be estimated by incorporating functional diversity of estate communities , using urban geography and human mobility data . Essentially , there are two major tasks : ( 1 ) learning the functional portfolios of estate communities from heterogeneous human mobility , and ( 2 ) predicting estate ranking by incorporating the impact of functional diversity . 2.2 Framework Overview
Figure 2 shows the framework of our geographic functional ranking . This framework consists of two major stages .
( 1 ) Functional Portfolio Learning . As shown in Figure 2 , we propose to learn the functional portfolio by mining three types of mobility patterns ( ie , mobile checkins , taxi trajectories , and bus trajectories ) , defined next .
Definition 1 . ( Checkin Pattern ) : Given a checkin event , the checkin pattern is a triple including information about ( 1 ) checkin day , ( 2 ) checkin hour , and ( 3 ) POI category of the checkin place .
Definition 2 . ( Taxi Mobility Pattern ) : Given a taxi trajectory , we extract the leaving ( ie , pick up ) and arriving

( ie , drop o↵ ) patterns as two tuples , each of which contains information about ( 1 ) weekday or weekend , ( 2 ) hour , and ( 3 ) leaving or arriving .
Definition 3 . ( Bus Mobility Pattern ) : Given a bus trajectory , we extract the leaving ( ie , pick up ) and arriving ( ie , drop o↵ ) patterns as two tuples , each of which contains information about ( 1 ) weekday or weekend , ( 2 ) hour , and ( 3 ) leaving or arriving .
We then associate all these mobility patterns to a nearby estate community once their checkin , pickup or dropo↵ points are located within the circle area of the estate with a radius of 1 km . Besides , we argue that the heterogeneous mobility patterns around an estate collectively reflect the mixed functions of its community . To this end , we assume there are multiple latent functions within the community of an estate . Moreover , an estate community shows di↵erent functions during di↵erent time periods . Therefore , given an estate and a time period , we can identify a unique mobility segmentation , which is defined as follows .
Definition 4 . ( Mobility Segment ) : A mobility segment is a six item tuple including an estate , a time period , a latent function of the estate community in this time period , checkin pattern cluster , taxi pattern cluster , and bus pattern cluster .
According to the above definition , in each mobility segment , the estate has three clusters of mobility patterns generated by the functional portfolio of its community . To learn the functional portfolio of each estate community , here we adapt the idea of topic modeling and develop a novel generative model , where the mobility patterns and clusters are analogized as words and documents , respectively . ( 2 ) Estate ranking with functional diversity . After learning the functional portfolios of estate communities , we extract the raw features from urban geography and human mobility . Furthermore , the raw features are then fed into ensemble decision trees ( in our experiments , random forests ) for generating meta features , and the output of each individual tree is treated as a meta feature . Here , we treat the investment value of an estate as a linear combination of both raw and meta features . Based on the above , we can learn an estate ranking predictor by jointly maximizing prediction accuracy , ranking consistency , and functional diversity . Finally , we infer the rankings of estates with the learned parameters . Next , Section 3 addresses the first problem of portfolio learning , and Section 4 of estate ranking .

Figure 3 : The graphical representation of the proposed geographic functional learning model . 3.1 Model Intuition
There are correlations among estate communities , urban functions , temporal e↵ects , and mobility patterns . Therefore , in our approach , we model the generative process of checkin , taxi , and bus mobility for each estate community , based on the following intuition .
Intuition 1 : A mixed estate community is represented as a mixture of urban functions in terms of its mixed land uses , and thus forms a portfolio of a fixed set of functions . Intuition 2 : The urban functions of a mixed community change over time . For example , people may visit an area for work on workday mornings , but visit the same area for entertainment during nights and weekends .
Intuition 3 : Mobility patterns reflect the functions of a community . For example , the residential function of a place can be indicated by massive leaving patterns in the early morning ( eg , people take public transit to work ) and massive arriving patterns around 6PM ( eg , people go home after work ) . Therefore , over a certain time period , a community shows specific mobility patterns which reflect a particular urban function .
Intuition 4 : Given a time period , an estate community has three clusters of mobility patterns . By treating mobility patterns and clusters as words and documents , respectively , we can model the corresponding generative processes and uncover the latent urban function through topic modeling . 3.2 Model Specification
Figure 3 shows the graphical representation of our geographic functional learning model . Specifically , we use a multinomial distribution ⌘m over K latent functions to model
301 Table 1 : The generative process of the geographic functional learning model .
Following the generative process in Table 1 , the joint dis tribution can be factored as
For each function f = k 2{ 1 , , K} :
Draw a multinomial distribution ✏k ⇠ P ( ✏k|µ ) Draw a multinomial distribution  k ⇠ P (  k|⌫ ) Draw a multinomial distribution ⌧k ⇠ P ( ⌧k|⇣ ) Draw a multinomial distribution ↵q ⇠ P ( ↵q| ) Draw a multinomial distribution  r ⇠ P (  r|$ ) Draw a multinomial distribution  w ⇠ P (  w|& ) Draw a multinomial distribution ⌘m ⇠ P ( ⌘m|⇢ ) ; For each time period n 2{ 1 , , N} :
For checkin latent topic z = q 2{ 1 , , Q} : For taxi latent topic u = r 2{ 1 , , R} : For bus latent topic v = w 2{ 1 , , W} : For each estate m 2{ 1 , , M} :
Draw a community function f ⇠ P ( f|⌘m ) ; For each checkin mobility pattern c 2 cccm,n :
For each taxi mobility pattern t 2 tttm,n :
Draw a latent topic of checkin document z ⇠ P ( z|✏f ) ; Draw a checkin mobility pattern c ⇠ P ( c|↵z ) . Draw a latent topic of taxi document u ⇠ P ( u| f ) ; Draw a taxi mobility pattern t ⇠ P ( t| u ) . Draw a latent topic of taxi document v ⇠ P ( v|⌧f ) ; Draw a bus mobility pattern b ⇠ P ( b| v ) .
For each bus mobility pattern b 2 bbbm,n : the functional portfolio of the estate m ( Intuition 1 ) . Based on Intuition 2 , the functions of an estate community may vary over time . We thus segment historical mobility patterns of checkin , taxi , and bus into multiple segments in terms of N defined time periods . For example , if we define seven time periods ( ie , Monday to Sunday ) , we first segment mobility patterns day by day , and then group these segments into seven clusters , each of which corresponds to a day of the week . We denote a mobility segment by a tuple {m , n , f , cccm,n , tttm,n , bbbm,n} introduced in Definition 4 , which is generated as follows . For each time period n , an estate m shows a specific urban function f drawn from ⌘m . Note that each function f has : ( 1 ) a multinomial distribution ✏f over checkin latent topics , which represents the relevance of checkin latent topics to the urban function f ; ( 2 ) a multinomial distribution  f over taxi latent topics , which represents the relevance of taxi latent topics to the urban function f ; and ( 3 ) a multinomial distribution ⌧f over bus latent topics , which represents the relevance of bus latent topics to the urban function f ( Intuition 3 ) . We iteratively draw : ( 1 ) a checkin latent topic z for each checkin pattern c 2 cccm,n in checkin mobility document cccm,n ; ( 2 ) a taxi latent topic u for each taxi pattern t 2 tttm,n in taxi mobility document tttm,n ; and ( 3 ) a bus latent topic v for each bus pattern b 2 bbbm,n in bus mobility document bbbm,n ( Intuition 4 ) . In summary , Table 1 shows the generative process .

FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY
Next , we introduce the proposed estate ranker by incor porating the impact of functional diversity . 4.1 Modeling Estate Investment Value
Before introducing the overall objective function , let us first introduce how to model the investment value of estates . Raw Features . Table 2 shows the raw features we have extracted from urban geography ( eg , bus stops , subway stations , road networks , POIs , etc. ) , human mobility ( eg , taxi trajectories , bus smart card transactions , checkins , etc . ) and social media ( eg , online business reviews , etc )
Meta Features . We exploit a random forest based method to learn meta features via supervised non linear transformation . Indeed , the work in [ 14 ] proved that decision trees can help improve the accuracy of predicting clicks on online advertisements . Therefore , we feed raw features and groundtruth real estate investment values into random forest , and learn a set of decision trees ( weak classifiers ) . We then treat each individual tree as a categorical feature which is represented by a binary valued vector . The elements of vectors correspond to tree leaves and the values indicate whether an estate falls into the corresponding leaf . For example , [ 1,0,0 ] indicates the tree has three leaves and the estate falls into the first leaf .
Finally , we linearly combine both raw and meta features to formulate estate investment value . Formally , let xmxmxm denote the I size vector representation of estate m with the above extracted features , www denote the weights of features , gm denote the predicted estate value of estate m , ym denote the ground truth investment value of estate m , and N represent the normal distribution . The generative process of our linear model is

Here , we introduce how to jointly model prediction accuracy , ranking consistency , and functional diversity in a unified objective function of posterior probability . Let us denote all the parameters by  = {www} , the hyperparameters ⇤= { 2 f} . Indeed , the estate ranked list contains three component information of its ranking structure , denoted by  = {Y , ⇧ , ⌅} where Y , ⇧ , ⌅ are the investment values , rankings , and functional diversity of M estates respectively . Let ⇧ represent the inverse of ⇧ and ⇡m be the index of the m th ranked estate . For simplicity , we first assume that m = ⇡m = ⇡m . In other words , the estates in   are sorted and indexed in a descending order in terms of their investment values ( which coincides with descending rating rank ) . Therefore , the objective is to learn the parameters   that maximize the posterior probability P (  ;  , ⇤ )

( 8 ) Ranking Consistency . The ranked list of estates indeed can be encoded into a directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) , G = {V , E} , with the node set V as estates and the edge set E as pairwise ranking orders . For instance , edge m ! h represents that estate m is ranked higher than estate h . From a generative modeling angle , edge m ! h is generated by our model through a likelihood function P ( m ! h ) . The more valuable an estate m is compared to estate h , the larger P ( m ! h ) should be . P ( ⇧|  , ⇤ ) =
P ( m ! h|  , ⇤ ) ,

303 Functional Diversity . So far , each estate is associated with a vector of K dimensional distribution of functions . An estate with diverse functions is likely to have higher investment value and appears earlier in the estate ranked list . Therefore , one goal of our estate ranker is to find a list of estate such that high ranked estates maximally cover the K functions . Specifically , for each function k , we calculate the relevance score of the entire estate ranked list conditioned on the function k . We then aggregate the weighted sum of K relevance scores as a measurement of functional diversity .

After obtaining the parameters , we can construct the ranking function for predicting the investment value of estates , ie , E(ym|  ) = xmxmxm>www . For a new estate k ( lacking historical transaction information ) , we may predict its investment value accordingly . The larger the E(yk|  ) is , the higher investment value it has .
5 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
This section details our empirical evaluation of the pro posed method on real world data . 5.1 Data Description
Table 3 shows the detailed statistics of our real world data sets . The transportation data covers the bus system , the subway system , and the road networks of Beijing . We also extracted POI features from the Beijing POI data set . The taxi GPS traces were collected from a Beijing taxi company . Each trajectory contains trip ID , distance ( m ) , travel time ( s ) , average speed d(km/h ) , pick up time , drop o↵ time , pick up point , and drop o↵ point . In addition , we crawled

Real Estates the smart card transactions from the o cial website of Beijing Public Transportation Group . Each bus trip has card ID , time , expense , balance , route name , pick up and drop o↵ stop information ( name , longitude , and latitude ) . Moreover , the Beijing check in data were crawled from wwwjiepangcom , which is a Chinese version of Foursquare . Each check in event includes checkin time , POI name , POI category , address , longitude , latitude , and comments . Furthermore , we crawled Beijing online business reviews from wwwdianpingcom , which is a business review site in China . Each review contains shop ID , name , address , latitude , longitude , consumption cost , star rating ( 1–5 ) , POI category , environment , service , and overall rating . Finally , we crawled Beijing secondhand real estate data from wwwsoufuncom , which is the largest online real estate system in China .
Pi
In the real estate industry , investment value of a property is measured by return rate . This is the ratio of the price increase relative to the starting price of a market period , ie , r = Pf  Pi , where Pf and Pi denote the final and initial prices , respectively . To prepare the benchmark investment values of estates ( Y ) for training data , we first calculated the return rate of each estate during a given market period . We then sorted the return rates of all the estates in descending order . Finally , we partition them into five clusters using variance based top down hierarchical clustering [ 12 ] . In this way , we segmented the estates into five ordered value categories ( ie , 4>3>2>1>0 , the higher the better ) . Estate grading is a way to evaluate the investment potential and reduce the impact of fluctuations in return rates that do not

Finally , a list of estates , together with the extracted features and investment value of each , were split into two data sets , corresponding to the falling market period ( from July 2011 to February 2012 ) and the rising market period ( from February 2012 to September 2012 ) , as shown in Figure 4 . Here we follow the norms of real estate research , which typically studies rising and falling markets separately [ 24 , 6 ] . 5.2 Baseline Algorithms
Since our work is related to Learning To Rank ( LTR ) , we compared our method against the following algorithms . ( 1 ) Coordinate Ascent [ 23 ] : uses domination loss and coordinate descent optimization . ( 2 ) LambdaMART [ 3 ] : the boosted tree version of LambdaRank . ( 3 ) FenchelRank [ 21 ] : designed for solving sparse learning to rank with an L1 constraint . ( 4 ) ListNet [ 5 ] : a listwise ranking model with permutation top k ranking likelihood as the objective function .
Beyond traditional ranking models , we further compare with two methods specifically designed for real estate ranking . ( 5 ) SEK [ 12 ] : exploits regression modeling , pairwise ranking objective , and sparsity regularization , to solve the real estate ranking problem . Also , its feature design includes the entropy of POI distribution , which is an summary index of functional diversity . ( 6 ) ClusRanking [ 13 ] : solves the estate ranking problem by capturing individual , peer , and zone dependencies .
In our experiments , we used RTree to index geographic items ( eg , POIs , trajectories , checkins , etc . ) and extracted the defined features . For traditional LTR algorithms , we used RankLib 1 . For Coordinate Ascent , we set step base = 0.05 , step scale = 2.0 , tolerance = 0.001 , and slack = 0001 For LambdaMART , we set number of trees = 100 , number of leaves = 10 , number of threshold candidates = 256 , learning rate = 01 For FenchelRank , we use the source code2 provided by the author . For SEK , we set a = 0.01 , b = 0.01 , and  2 = 1000 . For ClusRanking , we set  1=0.8 ,  2=25m , latent business areas K = 10 , ⌘ = 1 K , µq = µw = 0 ,  q =  w =   = 35 and M = 3 for hyperparameters . For our method,we implemented the geo functional learning model in C and DivFuncRanking model in Python with the Scipy optimization package . We used a KNN based method to impute the values of missing features . To learn the meta features , we leveraged the scikit learn random forest package , where the number of trees is set to 100 . We randomly divided the data into 70 % for training and 30 % for testing , and used Matlab for result visualization . 5.3 Evaluation Metrics Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain . The discounted cumulative gain ( DCG ) metric is evaluated over top N estates on the ranked estate list by assuming that high value estates should appear earlier in the ranked list .
DCG[n ] = ⇢ rel 1
DCG[n   1 ] + reln if n >= 2 Later , given the ideal discounted cumulative gain DCG0 , NDCG at the nth position can be computed as NDCG[n ] = DCG[n ] , where DCG0 [ n ] refn refers to the investment rating of estate n . log2n , if n = 1

Precision . We binarize our five level rating system ( 4 > 3 > 2 > 1 > 0 ) by treating the ratings   3 as “ high value ” and ratings < 3 as “ low value ” . Given a top N estate list EN sorted in descending order of prediction values , the precision is defined as Precision@N = |EN T E 3| , where E 3 are the estates whose ratings are greater or equal to 3 . Kendall ’s Tau Coe cient . Kendall ’s Tau Coe cient ( or Tau for short ) measures the overall ranking accuracy . Let us assume that each estate i is associated with a benchmark score yi and a predicted score fi . Then , an estate pair hi , ji is said to be concordant , if both yi > yj and fi > fj or if both yi < yj and fi < fj . Conversely , hi , ji is said to be discordant , if both yi < yj and fi > fj or if both yi < yj and fi > fj . Tau is given by Tau = #conc #disc . Diversity is #conc +#disc m h=1 ⌘h,f m=1 ym⌘m,f
. The larger diversity , m=1 ymPm f =1 ✓f PM PM the better . Perplexity and Diversity . Perplexity and diversity are used to study parameter sensitivity , defined by Perplexity = defined asPK expn  PM m=1PN m=1PN PM m=1 ymPm f =1 ✓f PM PK PM 5.4 Evaluation of Geographical Functional Port n=1(|cccm,n|+|tttm,n|+|bbbm,n|)o , and Diversity = n=1 log P ( cccm,n,tttm,n,bbbm,n ) m=1 ym⌘m,f h=1 ⌘h,f m
. folio Learning
Next , we study our geographic functional learning model in terms of parameter sensitivity , temporal popular topics and patterns , and community functional portfolios .
( 1 ) Study of Parameter Sensitivity . Here , we investigate the sensitivity of di↵erent parameter settings in terms of three metrics : likelihood , perplexity , and diversity . Figure 5(a ) plots the likelihood against the number of iterations . The likelihoods in all settings converge after 100 iterations . To ensure convergence , we retrieve all the results after 200 iterations . Figure 5(b ) shows that the perplexity decreases as the number of functions decreases , in terms of di↵erent prior ( ⇢ ) settings . Since the trends of perplexity for di↵erent numbers of latent topics are similar , we only show the plots where Q = R = W = 10 . Meanwhile , we notice that a smaller ⇢ results in a larger perplexity when K is small , and the perplexity gaps between di↵erent settings become small with the increase of K . Hence , we make a trade o↵ and set ⇢ to 7 in the following experiments . In addition , when K increases from 5 to 20 , the perplexity decreases smoothly . Figure 5(c ) shows that the di↵erences among the diversities in all settings are not significant , and the number of latent topics is less related with diversity . Therefore , to avoid overfitting , we set K = 5 , Q = R = W = 7 , because the number of time periods for mobility segments is small ( ie , N = 7 , one day per segment ) , and the sizes of vocabularies of checkin , taxi , and bus patterns are also small .

Topic 4
( 2 ) Study of temporal popularity of checkin , taxi , and bus latent topics . We compute the topic distributions of checkin , taxi , and bus with respect to di↵erent week days . Figure 6 presents the topic distributions over seven days , with values represented by color darkness . We also list the representative words for these popular topics in Tables 4 , 5 , and 6 , respectively . Figure 6 validates that the topic distribution of mobility has a temporal pattern . First , Figure 6(a ) shows that checkin latent topics 1 , 3 , and 4 are popular during both weekdays and weekends . This is because topics 5 , 6 , 7 respectively represent shopping , entertainment , and catering activities at noon or at night , as shown in Table 4 . Next , Figure 6(b ) shows that taxi latent topics 3 and 4 are popular only during weekdays , while topics 4 and 6 are popular during both weekdays and weekends . From Table 5 , we can see topics 3 and 4 generally include arriving patterns in the morning ( ie , go to work ) and leaving patterns at night ( ie , leave after work ) , and thus mainly happen in weekdays . Topics 6 and 7 are combinations of both working activities ( ie , arriving early in the morning and leaving after 5PM ) and catering , entertainment , and commercial activities ( ie , arriving after 5PM and leaving at night ) , and thus are popular during both weekdays and weekends . In addition , Table 6 shows that bus latent topics 6 and 7 include both working activities as well as catering , entertainment , and commercial activities , and thus cover both weekdays and weekends . On the other hand , bus latent topic 5 with only working activities is popular on weekdays . Bus latent topic 4 is mostly about recreation activities at night and is thus popular on weekends . The above analysis demonstrates that the geographic functional learning model can capture temporal patterns of checkin , taxi , and bus mobility .
( 3 ) Study of functional distribution of high ranked and low ranked estates . Here , we visualize the functional distribution of high ranked and low ranked estates , and study the correlation between real estate value and functional diversity . Figure 7 compares the functional distributions of high ranked ( ie , top 1–25 ) and low ranked ( ie , top 2505–2530 ) estates . High ranked estates generally show diverse and balanced distributions among di↵erent functions , Whereas low ranked estates show unbalanced distributions with low heterogeneity . This observation validates the assumption that a good functional portfolio can increase investment value . 5.5 Evaluation on Real Estate Ranking
Here , we report the evaluation results of our method , compared to baseline algorithms , on the rising and falling markets , in terms of NDCG , Precision , and Tau .

Figure 9 : Performance comparison , falling market . features from user reviews and mobility behaviors and integrates sparsity regularization into pairwise estate ranking . The work in [ 13 ] jointly models the geographical individual , peer , and zone dependencies for enhancing prediction of estate investment value . More recent works [ 18 ] apply general additive mode , support vector machine regression , and multilayer perceptron ensembles for computational estate appraisal . Learning To Rank with Diversity . Also , our work is related to LTR . The pair wise methods , such as RankNet [ 4 ] , RankBoost [ 11 ] , RankSVM [ 15 ] , and LambdaRank [ 26 ] , reduce the LTR task to a classification problem . The goal of the pairwise ranking is to learn a binary classifier to identify the better document in a given document pair by minimizing the average number of rank inversions . Works [ 33 , 27 ] provide full Bayesian explanations and optimize the posterior of point wise and pair wise ranking models , respectively . Study [ 28 ] unifies both rating error and ranking error as objective function to enhance Top K recommendation . More recent works [ 35 , 31 , 25 ] study diversified learning to rank . For example , [ 35 ] ranks items by random walks in an absorbing Markov chain and achieves both diversity and centrality . The work in [ 31 ] proposes a diversified ranking objective by incorporating subtopics into MAP ( Mean Average Precision ) for expert finding . Urban Computing and Site Selection . Our work also has a connection with mining of mobile , geographical , and mobility data , to tackle issues in the urban space . Yuan et al . discover regional functions of a city using POIs and taxi traces [ 34 ] . Work [ 16 ] selects the optimal sites for retail stores by mining Foursquare data . Also , our work is related to measuring similarity for ranking [ 9 , 8 ] .
7 . CONCLUDING REMARKS
Summary . In this paper , we investigated how to rank real estate investment values by considering the impact of
Figure 7 : Comparison of functional distributions of high ranked and low ranked estates .
For example , our method o↵ers 21 % , 32.4 % , 47.2 % improvement in terms of NDCG@3 compared to SEK , FenchelRank , and RankBoost , respectively . Figure 8(b ) shows that the top K results ( K = 3 , 5 , 7 , 10 ) of our method consist almost exclusively of estates with rating   3 . For example , all our top 10 results are high value , compared to just 2 for random or CoordAsc ranking , and 7–8 for the best competitor .
Falling Market . As can be seen in Figure 9 , our method outperforms the baselines over top K ranking by a significant margin in falling market . Specifically , our method achieves 27.5 % , 17.3 % , and 99 % improvement in terms of NDCG@3 compared to SEK , RankBoost , and FenchelRank , respectively . Unfortunately , we observe the overall ranking accuracy of our method decreases and is lower than ClusRanking and SEK . Finally , although our goal is to identify top investment opportunities , for completeness we also evaluate the total ranking of all estates , showing Tau scores in Table 7 .
Next , we discuss how our work di↵ers from previous work on real estate ranking . First , while ClusRanking [ 13 ] considers proximity and zone dependencies to capture pairwise ranking consistency , our method takes into account not only prediction accuracy and ranking consistency , but also the impact of mixed land use ( ie , functional diversity ) . As a result , we can better capture the ranking of the list of estates . Indeed , we observe a significant improvement in topK ranking over classic LTR methods . Second , we exploit random forests to generate meta features from raw features . Third , although SEK [ 12 ] includes the entropy of POI distribution as one of the features , its predictive power may be diluted by the large number of other extracted features . In contrast , our method can emphasize the functional diversity directly in the ranking objective . 6 . RELATED WORK Real Estate Appraisal and Ranking . Traditional research on estate appraisal is based on financial real estate theory , typically constructing an explicit index of estate value [ 20 ] , for example , price to income ratio . Some studies rely on financial time series analysis by inspecting the trend , periodicity and volatility of estate prices [ 7 , 10 ] . More classic works are based on repeat sales methods and hedonic methods [ 1 , 29 , 17 , 32 ] . The work in [ 10 ] studies the automated valuation models which aggregate and analyze physical characteristics and sales prices of comparable properties , to provide property valuations . The work in [ 12 ] extracts

Since human mobility patterns provide a reasonable estimation of diverse functions present in the community of an estate , we developed a latent factor model to learn the portfolio of community functions for real estate from human mobility data . Then , we designed a unified probabilistic framework which allows simultaneous maximization of ranking consistency and of functional diversity for real estate ranking . Finally , we conducted extensive experiments on real world human mobility data , urban geographical data , and user check in data collected from location based social networks . As revealed in the experimental results , a diverse view of mixed land use can help to better capture real estate values and the performance improvement of our proposed method is substantial compared to benchmark methods .
Discussion.This paper focused on assessing the investment ratings of residential complexes in urban areas of big cities , whose developing strategy is mixed land using , for business site selection . In di↵erent cities , buyers may have personalized expectations on functional diversity , the method of incorporating functional diversity can be further enhanced for personalized real estate recommendation .
