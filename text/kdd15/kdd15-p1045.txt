ABSTRACT We present a Bayesian tensor factorization model for inferring latent group structures from dynamic pairwise interaction patterns . For decades , political scientists have collected and analyzed records of the form “ country i took action a toward country j at time t ” —known as dyadic events—in order to form and test theories of international relations . We represent these event data as a tensor of counts and develop Bayesian Poisson tensor factorization to infer a lowdimensional , interpretable representation of their salient patterns . We demonstrate that our model ’s predictive performance is better than that of standard non negative tensor factorization methods . We also provide a comparison of our variational updates to their maximum likelihood counterparts . In doing so , we identify a better way to form point estimates of the latent factors than that typically used in Bayesian Poisson matrix factorization . Finally , we showcase our model as an exploratory analysis tool for political scientists . We show that the inferred latent factor matrices capture interpretable multilateral relations that both conform to and inform our knowledge of international affairs .

INTRODUCTION
Social processes are characterized by pairwise connections between actors , such as people , organizations , corporations , and countries . In some social processes , actors declare their connections and researchers can directly study them—eg , friendships on Facebook or co authorships in academia . In other processes , however , these connections are not explicitly declared . Rather , they are evidenced over time via dynamic interaction patterns . Inferring social processes from such implicit data is a challenging and important task .
This task is especially motivated in international relations . For decades , scholars have collected and analyzed records of pairwise interactions between countries of the form “ country i took action a toward country j at time t , ” known as dyadic events . These data sets , eg , [ 28 ] , which are traditionally small and well curated , help them form and test theories of international relations , which often concern the multilateral behavior of groups of countries . Recently , there has been new interest in studying less structured , larger scale sources of pairwise interaction data . Researchers have created several large data sets , eg , [ 20 ] , by automatically extracting and encoding dyadic events from Internet news archives .
These modern data sets differ substantially from their smaller counterparts , which previously dominated the field . Rather than documenting high level , aggregate behaviors , such as formal wars and military alliances , they document micro level behaviors at a day to day granularity . Although this new view of the world potentially paints a more accurate and nuanced picture of international relations , these data are too noisy and disaggregated to analyze effectively using traditional techniques . We need new methods to uncover the latent multilateral relations that underlie these events .
In this paper , we introduce Bayesian Poisson tensor factorization ( BPTF ) for inferring latent multilateral relations from observed dyadic events . We present a scalable variational inference algorithm and demonstrate our method , via both predictive and exploratory analyses , on large scale international relations data . Figure 1 illustrates our approach ; our model infers both ongoing multilateral relations , such as the Six Party Talks from 2003 through 2009 ( left ) , as well as relations precipitated by temporally localized anomalous activity , such as the September 11 , 2001 attacks ( right ) .
1045 Figure 1 : Our model infers latent components that correspond to multilateral relations . Each component consists of four factor vectors summarizing sender , receiver , action type , and time step activity , respectively . Here , we visualize two inferred components . For each component , we plotted the top ten sender , receiver , and action type factors sorted in decreasing order . We also plotted the entire vector of time step factors in chronological order . We found that the interpretation of each component was either immediately clear from our existing knowledge or easy to discover via a web search . Left : A component inferred from GDELT data spanning 1990 through 2007 ( with monthly time steps ) that corresponds to events surrounding the Six Party Talks—a series of diplomatic talks that took place from 2003 through 2009 between South Korea , North Korea , the US , China , Japan , and Russia , aimed at resolving international concerns over North Korea ’s nuclear weapons program [ 37 ] . The top senders and receivers are the six parties , while the top action types are Consult and Intend to Cooperate . The time step factors show increased activity beginning in 2003 . Right : A component inferred from ICEWS data spanning 1995 through 2012 ( with monthly time steps ) that corresponds to events surrounding the US led War on Terror following the September 11 , 2001 attacks . The largest time step factor is that of October 2001—the month during which the invasion of Afghanistan occurred . There is also a blip in August 1998 , when the Clinton administration ordered missile attacks on terrorist bases in Afghanistan [ 33 ] .
Technical summary : A data set of dyadic events can be represented as a four way tensor by aggregating ( ie , counting ) events within discrete time steps . Each element of the tensor is a count of the number of actions of type a taken by country i toward country j at time t . Our model decomposes such a tensor into a set of latent factor matrices that provide a low dimensional representation of the salient patterns in the counts—in this case , latent multilateral relations .
Tensors derived from dyadic event data are often very sparse since most countries rarely interact with one another . Additionally , the non zero counts , for countries that do interact , are highly dispersed—ie , their mean is greatly exceeded by their variance . Traditional tensor factorization methods , involving maximum likelihood estimation , are unstable when fit to sparse count tensors [ 2 ] . Bayesian Poisson tensor factorization ( section 3 ) builds on previous work on Bayesian Poisson matrix factorization with Gamma priors [ 1 , 21 , 11 , 38 , 25 , 10 ] to avoid these instabilities . We validate our model by comparing its out of sample predictive performance to non Bayesian tensor factorization methods ( section 5 ) ; BPTF significantly outperforms other models when decomposing sparse , highly dispersed count data .
We present an efficient variational inference algorithm to fit BPTF to data ( section 4 ) and outline the relationship between our algorithm and the traditional maximum likelihood approach ( section 7 ) . This relationship explains why BPTF outperforms other methods without any sacrifice to efficiency . It also suggests that when constructing point estimates of the latent factors from the variational distribution , researchers should use the geometric expectation instead of the arithmetic expectation commonly used in Bayesian Poisson matrix factorization . We show that using the geometric expectation increases the sparsity of the inferred factors and improves predictive performance . We therefore recommend its use in any subsequent work involving variational inference for Bayesian Poisson matrix or tensor factorization .
Finally , we showcase Bayesian Poisson tensor factorization as an exploratory analysis tool for political scientists ( section 6 ) . We demonstrate that the inferred latent factor matrices capture interpretable multilateral relations that conform to and inform our knowledge of international affairs .
2 . DYADIC EVENTS
Over the past few years , researchers have created large data sets of dyadic events by automatically extracting them from Internet news archives . The largest of these data sets is the Global Database of Events , Location , and Tone ( GDELT ) , introduced in 2013 , which contains over a quarter of a billion events from 1979 to the present , and is updated with new events daily [ 20 ] . In parallel , government agencies ( eg , DARPA ) and their contractors have also started to collect and analyze dyadic events , in order to forecast political instability and to develop early warning systems [ 24 ] ; Lockheed Martin publicly released the Integrated Crisis Early Warning System ( ICEWS ) database in early 2015 . Ward et al . provide a comparison of GDELT and ICEWS [ 31 ] .
GDELT and ICEWS use the CAMEO coding scheme [ 6 ] . A CAMEO coded dyadic event consists of four pieces of information : a sender , a receiver , an action type , and a timestamp . An example of such an event ( top ) and a sentence from which it could have been extracted ( bottom ) is
Turkey , Syria , Fight , 12/25/2014
Dec . 25 , 2014 : “ Turkish jets bombed targets in Syria . ”
CAMEO assumes that senders and receivers belong to a single set of actors , coded for their country of origin and sector ( eg , government or civilian ) as well as other information

CAMEO also assumes a hierarchy of action types , with the top level consisting of twenty basic action classes . These classes are loosely ranked based on sentiment from Make Public Statement to Use Unconventional Mass Violence . Each action class is subdivided into more specific actions ; for example , Make Public Statement contains Make Empathetic Comment . When studying international relations using CAMEO coded data , researchers commonly consider only the countries of origin as actors and only the twenty basic action classes as action types . In ICEWS , there are 249 unique country of origin actors ( which include non universally recognized countries , such as Taiwan and Palestine ) ; in GDELT , there are 223 .
Dyadic events as tensors : A data set of dyadic events can be aggregated into a four way tensor Y of size N × N × A × T , where N is the number of country actors and A is the number of action types , by aggregating the events into T time steps on the basis of their timestamps . Each element yijat of Y is a count of the number of actions of type a taken by country i toward country j during time step t . As described in section 6 , we experimented with various date ranges and time step granularities . For example , in one set of experiments , we used the entire ICEWS data set , spanning 1995 through 2012 ( ie , 18 years ) with monthly time steps— ie , a 249× 249× 20× 216 tensor with 267,844,320 elements . Tensors derived from ICEWS and GDELT are very sparse . For the 249× 249× 20× 216 ICEWS tensor described above , only 0.54 % of the elements ( roughly 1.5 million elements ) are non zero . Moreover , these non zero counts are highly dispersed with a variance to mean ratio ( VMR ) of 57 . Any realistic model of such data must therefore be robust to sparsity and capable of representing high levels of dispersion .
3 . BAYESIAN POISSON TENSOR
FACTORIZATION
Tensor factorization methods decompose an observed M way tensor Y into M latent factor matrices Θ(1 ) , . . . , Θ(M ) that provide a low dimensional representation of the salient patterns in Y . There are many different tensor factorization methods ; the two most common methods are the Tucker decomposition [ 30 ] and the Canonical Polyadic ( CP ) decomposition [ 13 ] . These methods can both be viewed as tensor generalizations of singular value decomposition . Here , we focus on the CP decomposition , as it performs better than the Tucker decomposition when modeling sparse count data [ 18 ] . For a four way count tensor Y of size N × N × A× T , the
CP decomposition treats each observed count yijat as yijat ≈ ˆyijat ≡ K
θ(1 ) ik θ(2 ) jk θ(3 ) ak θ(4 ) tk
( 1 ) k=1 ik , θ(2 ) for i , j ∈ [ N ] , a ∈ [ A ] , and t ∈ [ T ] , where θ(1 ) jk , θ(3 ) ak , and θ(4 ) tk are known as factors , ˆyijat is known as the reconstruction of count yijat , and ˆY is the reconstruction of the entire tensor Y . The set of all factors used to model Y can be aggregated into four latent factor matrices ; for ex—an N × K matrix . Since each factor matrix has K columns , a single index k ∈ [ K ] indexes four columns ( one per matrix ) . These columns are collectively known as a component ; for example , component — ample , Θ(1 ) ≡ ,,θ(1 ) N k consists of,θ(1 )
K N N ,,θ(2 )

Figure 1 visually depicts two components inferred from ICEWS and GDELT . When viewed from a probabilistic perspective , the recontk can be thought of as the mean of the distribution from which the observed count yijat is assumed to have been drawn . If this distribution is a Poisson—ie , if yijat ∼ Pois(yijat ; ˆyijat)—then the process of decomposing Y into its latent factor matrices is known as Poisson tensor factorization ( PTF ) , and can be performed via maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) of Θ(1 ) , Θ(2 ) , Θ(3 ) , and Θ(4 ) . For sparse count data , PTF often yields better estimates of the latent factor matrices than those obtained by assuming each count to have been drawn from a Gaussian distribution—ie , yijat ∼ N ( yijat ; ˆyijat , σ2 ) [ 2 ] .
In this paper , we also assume that each observed count yijat is drawn from a Poisson distribution with mean ˆyijat ; however , rather than obtaining point estimates of the factor matrices using maximum likelihood estimation , we impose prior distributions on the latent factors and perform full Bayesian inference . Bayesian inference for Poisson matrix factorization ( PMF ) was originally proposed by Cemgil [ 1 ] and has been successfully used for several tasks including image reconstruction [ 1 ] , music tagging [ 21 ] , topic modeling [ 25 ] , content recommendation [ 11 ] , and community detection [ 9 ] ; here , we generalize Bayesian PMF to tensors.1
Since the Gamma distribution is the conjugate prior for a Poisson likelihood , Bayesian PMF typically imposes Gamma priors on the latent factors [ 1 , 11 , 39 ] . The Gamma distribution , which has support on ( 0,∞ ) , is parameterized by a shape parameter a > 0 and a rate parameter b > 0 ; if θ ∼ Gamma ( θ ; a , b ) , then E[θ ] = a b2 . Thus , when a 1 and b is small , the Gamma distribution concentrates most of its mass near zero yet maintains a heavy tail and can therefore be used as a sparsity inducing prior [ 1 , 11 ] . We show the effects of different a and b values in figure 2 . b and Var[θ ] = a
To define Bayesian Poisson tensor factorization ( BPTF ) for a four way tensor , we impose four sparsity inducing Gamma priors over the latent factors . For a single factor , eg , θ(1 ) ik , ik ∼ Gamma ( θ(1 ) θ(1 ) ik ; α , α β(1) ) ,

Under this parameterization of the Gamma distribution , where the rate parameter is the product of the shape parameter and β(1 ) , the mean of the prior is completely determined by β(1 ) ( since E[θ(1 ) β(1 ) ) , which can be inferred from the data [ 1 , 21 ] . The shape parameter α , which determines the sparsity of the latent factor matrices , can be set by the user . Throughout our experiments , we use α = 0.1 to encourage sparsity and hence promote interpretability of the factors .

4 . VARIATIONAL INFERENCE
Given an observed tensor Y , Bayesian inference of the latent factors involves “ inverting ” the generative process described in the previous section to obtain the posterior distribution of the latent factor matrices conditioned on Y and the model hyperparameters H ≡ {α , β(1 ) , β(2 ) , β(3 ) , β(4)} :
Θ(1 ) , Θ(2 ) , Θ(3 ) , Θ(4 ) | Y,H
P where EQ [ · ] and GQ [ · ] = exp ( EQ [ log ( ·) ] ) denote arithmetic and geometric expectations . Since Q is fully factorized , each expectation of a product can be factorized into a product of individual expectations , which , eg , for θ(1 ) ik are exp,Ψ,γ(1 )

Note that the summand in ( 4 ) need only be computed for those values of j , a , and t for which yijat > 0 ; provided Y is very sparse , inference is efficient even for very large tensors . The hyperparameters β(1 ) , β(2 ) , β(3 ) , and β(4 ) can be optimized via an empirical Bayes method , in which each hyperparameter is iteratively updated along with the variational parameters according to the following update equation :

The posterior distribution for BPTF is analytically intractable and must be approximated . Variational inference turns the process of approximating the posterior distribution into an optimization algorithm . It involves first specifying a parametric family of distributions Q over the latent variables of interest , indexed by the values of a set of variational parameters S . The functional form of Q is typically chosen so as to facilitate efficient optimization of S . Here , we use a fully factorized mean field approximation and define Q to be the product of N · N · A · T · K independent Gamma distributions—one for each latent factor—eg , for θ(1 ) ik , i,k
Update equations ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 7 ) completely specify the variational inference algorithm for BPTF . Our Python implementation , which is intended to support arbitrary M way tensors in addition to the four way tensors described in this paper , is available for use under an open source license2 .

. The full set of variational parameters is thus S ≡ {S ( 1),S ( 2),S ( 3),S ( 4)} . This form of Q is similar to that used in Bayesian PMF [ 1 , 25 , 11 ] . k=1 i=1
The variational parameters are then fit so as to yield the closest member of Q to the exact posterior—known as the variational distribution . Specifically , the algorithm sets the values of S to those that minimize the KL divergence of the exact posterior from Q . It can be shown that these values are the same as those that maximize a lower bound on P ( Y |H ) , known as the evidence lower bound ( ELBO ) : B(S ) = EQ

When Q is a fully factorized approximation , finding values of S that maximize the ELBO can be achieved by performing coordinate ascent , iteratively updating each variational parameter , while holding the others fixed , until convergence ( defined by relative change in the ELBO ) . The update equation for each parameter can be derived easily using an auxiliary variable as shown for Bayesian PMF [ 1 , 25 , 11 ] ; we therefore omit derivations . ik , the update equations are GQ

Baselines : Non Bayesian methods for CP decomposition find values of the latent factor matrices that minimize some cost function of the observed tensor Y and its reconstruction ˆY . Researchers have proposed many cost functions , but most often use Euclidean distance or generalized KL divergence , preferring the latter when the observed tensor consists of sparse counts . Generalized KL divergence is
( yijat log ( ˆyijat ) − ˆyijat ) + C ,
( 8 )
D(Y || ˆY ) = − where constant C ≡ i,j,a,t i,j,a,t ( yijat log ( yijat ) − yijat ) depends on the observed data only . The standard method for estimating the values of the latent factors involves multiplicative update equations , originally introduced for matrix factorization by Lee and Seung [ 19 ] and later generalized to tensors by Welling and Weber [ 32 ] . The multiplicative nature of these update equations acts as a non negativity constraint on the factors which promotes interpretability and gives the algorithm its name : non negative tensor factorization ( NTF ) .
Some cost functions also permit a probabilistic interpretation : finding values of the latent factors that minimize them is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation of a probabilistic model . The log likelihood function of a Poisson tensor factorization model—yijat ∼ Pois(yijat ; ˆyijat)—is

We then divided the observed tensor into a training set and a test set by randomly constructing an 80%–20 % split of the time steps . We defined training set Y train to be the N × N × A slices of Y indexed by the time steps in the 80 % split and defined test set Y test to be the N × N × A slices indexed by the time steps in the 20 % split . We compared the models’ predictive performance in two scenarios , intended to test their abilities to handle different levels of sparsity and dispersion : one in which we treated the denser upper left N × N ( for some N < N ) portion of each test slice as observed at test time and predicted its complement , and one in which we observed the complement at test time and predicted the denser N × N portion .
In each setting , we used an experimental strategy analogous to strong generalization for collaborative filtering [ 23 ] . During training , we fit each model to the fully observed training set . We then fixed the values of the variational parameters for the sender , receiver , and action type factor matrices ( or direct point estimates of the factors , for the non Bayesian models ) to those inferred from the training set . For each test slice , indexed by time step t , we used the observed upper left N × N portion ( or its complement ) to infer variational parameters for ( or direct point estimates of ) its time step factors {θ(4 ) k=1 . Finally , we reconstructed the missing portion of each test slice using equation ( 1 ) . For the reconstruction step , we can obtain point estimates of the latent factors by taking their arithmetic expectations or their geometric expectations under the variational distribution . In this section , we report results obtained using geometric expectations only ; we explain this choice in section 7 . tk }K
The time step factors inferred from the observed portion of a given test slice capture the extent to which the sender , receiver , and action type factors for each component inferred from the training set describe ( the observed portion of ) that slice . For example , if component k summarizes the Israeli– Palestinian conflict , with Israel and Palestine as top actors and Fight as a top action type , then if Israeli–Palestinian hostilities were intense during test time step t and if Israel

The left slice corresponds to Intend to Cooperate , while the right slice corresponds to Threaten . We sorted the country actors by their overall activity so that the slices were generally denser toward the upper left corner ; only the upper left 35 × 35 portion of each slice is shown here . The three darkest elements ( ie , highest counts ) in the second slice correspond to Israel → Palestine , Palestine → Israel , and US → Iraq . where constant C ≡ i,j,a,t − log ( yijat! ) depends on the observed data only . Since equation ( 8 ) is equal to the negative of equation ( 10 ) up to a constant , maximum likelihood estimation for Poisson tensor factorization is equivalent to minimizing the generalized KL divergence of ˆY from Y .
To validate our modeling assumptions , we compared the out of sample predictive performance of BPTF to that of non negative tensor factorization with Euclidean distance ( NTF LS ) and non negative tensor factorization with generalized KL divergence ( NTF KL or , equivalently PTF ) .
Experimental design : Using both ICEWS and GDELT , we explored how well each model generalizes to out of sample data with varying degrees of sparsity and dispersion .

We used the entire ICEWS data set from 1995 through 2012 ( ie , 18 years ) , with events aggregated into monthly time steps . The resultant tensor was of size 249 × 249 × 20 × 216 . Since GDELT covers a larger date range ( 1979 to the present ) than ICEWS , we therefore selected an 18year subset of GDELT spanning 1990 through 2007 , and aggregated events into monthly time steps to yield a tensor of size 223 × 223 × 20 × 216 . Since we are interested in interactions between countries , we omitted self actions so that the diagonal of each N × N sender–receiver slice was zero . Ranking the country actors by their overall activity ( as both sender and receiver ) , the top four actors in the ICEWS tensor are USA , Russia , China , and Israel , while the top four actors in the GDELT tensor are USA , Russia , Israel , and Iraq . The GDELT tensor contains many more events than the ICEWS tensor ( 26 million events versus six million events ) . It is also much denser ( 1.6 % of the elements are non zero , as opposed to 0.54 % ) and exhibits a much higher level of dispersion ( VMR of 100 , as opposed to 57 ) .
Summary of results : The out of sample predictive performance of each model is shown in table 1 . We experimented with several different values of K and found that all three models were insensitive to its value ; we therefore report only those results obtained using K = 50 . We computed three types of error : mean absolute error ( MAE ) , mean absolute error on only non zero elements ( MAE NZ ) , and Hamming loss on only the zero elements ( HAM Z ) . HAM Z corresponds to the fraction of true zeros in the unobserved portion of the test set ( ie , elements for which yijat = 0 ) whose reconstructions were ( incorrectly ) predicted as being greater than 05 For each data set , we generated three training–test splits , and averaged the error scores for each model across them . For each experiment included in table 1 , we display the density and dispersion of the corresponding test set . When we treated the dense upper left N × N portion as observed at test time ( and predicted its complement ) , all models performed comparably . In this scenario , NTF LS consistently achieved the lowest MAE score and the lowest HAM Z score , but not the lowest MAE NZ score . This pattern suggests that NTF LS overfits the sparsity of the training set : when the unobserved portion of the test set is much sparser than the training set ( as it is in this scenario ) , NTF LS achieves lower error scores by simply predicting many more zeros than NTF KL ( ie , PTF ) or BPTF . In the opposite scenario , when we observed the complement at test time and predicted the denser N × N portion , NTF LS produced significantly worse predictions than the other models , and our model ( BPTF ) achieved the lowest MAE , MAE NZ , and HAM Z scores—in some cases by an order of magnitude over NTF KL . These results suggest that in the presence of sparsity , BPTF is a much better model for the “ interesting ” portion of the tensor—ie , the dense non zero portion . This observation is consistent with previous work by Chi and Kolda which demonstrated that NTF can be unstable , particularly when the observed tensor is very sparse [ 2 ] . In section 7 , we provide a detailed discussion comparing NTF and BPTF , and explain why BPTF overcomes the sparsity related issues often suffered by NTF .

When inferring factor matrices from data that span a large date range ( eg , 18 years ) , we expect that the inferred components will correspond to multilateral relations that persist or recur over time . Figure 1 shows two such components , inferred from the 18 year GDELT and ICEWS tensors . The first component corresponds to ongoing negotiations over North Korea ’s nuclear program , while the second corresponds to a decade long war ( though precipitated by a sudden anomalous event ) . We found that many the components inferred from 18 year tensors summarize regional relations—ie , multilateral relations that persist due to geographic proximity—similar to those found by Hoff [ 15 ] .
We found a high correspondence between the regional components inferred from GDELT and the regional components inferred from ICEWS , despite the five year difference in their date ranges . Figure 4 illustrates this correspondence . We also found that components summarizing regional rela

For example , the component depicted in figure 4 has near uniform values for the top ten sender and receiver actors ( all of whom are regional to Central Asia ) , while the time step factors possess high activity throughout . In contrast , the time step factors for the component shown in the second plot of figure 1 ( ie , the War on Terror ) exhibit a major spike in October 2001 . This component ’s sender and receiver factors also exhibit uneven activity over the top ten actors , with the US , Afghanistan , and Pakistan dominating . These “ regional relations ” components conform to our understanding of international affairs and foster confidence in BPTF as an exploratory analysis tool . However , for the same reason , they are also less interesting . To explore temporally localized multilateral relations—ie , anomalous interaction patterns that do not simply reflect usual activity— we used our model to infer components from several subsets of GDELT and ICEWS , each spanning a two year date range with weekly time steps . We ranked the inferred components by the sparsity of their time step factors , measured using the Gini coefficient [ 3 ] . Ranking components by their Gini coefficients is a form of anomaly detection : components with high Gini coefficients have unequal time step factor values— ie , dramatic spikes . Figure 6 shows the highest ranked ( ie , most anomalous ) component inferred from a subset of GDELT spanning 2011–2012 . This component features an unusual group of top actors and a clear burst of activity around June 2012 . To interpret this component , we performed a web search for ecuador UK sweden june 2012 and found that the top hit was a Wikipedia page [ 34 ] about Julian Assange , the editor in chief of the website WikiLeaks— an Australian national , wanted by the US and Sweden , who sought political asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in the UK during June through August 2012 . These countries are indeed the top actors for this component , while the timestep factors and top action types ( ie , Consult , Aid , and Appeal ) track the dates and nature of the reported events . In general , we found that when our existing knowledge was insufficient to interpret an inferred component , performing a web search for the top two to four actors along with the top time step resulted in either a Wikipedia page or a news

7 . TECHNICAL DISCUSSION
Previous work on Bayesian Poisson matrix factorization ( eg , [ 1 , 25 , 11 ] ) presented update equations for the variational parameters in terms of auxiliary variables , known as latent sources , and made no explicit reference to geometric expectations . In contrast , we write the update equations for Bayesian Poisson tensor factorization in the form of equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) in order to highlight their relationship to Lee and Seung ’s multiplicative updates for non negative tensor factorization—a parallel also drawn by Cemgil in his paper introducing Bayesian PMF [ 1]—and to show that our update equations suggest a new way of making out of sample predictions when using BPTF . In this section , we provide a discussion of these connections and their implications .

First : The three quantities for different values of shape a ≥ 1 ( x axis ) with rate b = 05 All three grow linearly with a and E [ θ ] ≥ G [ θ ] ≥ Mode ( θ ) . Second : Geometric and arithmetic expectations for different values of shape a ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) , where the mode is undefined , with rate b = 05 G [ θ ] grows more slowly than E [ θ ] . This property is most apparent when a < 04 Third : pdf of a Gamma distribution with shape a = 10 and rate b = 05 The three quantities are shown as vertical lines . All three are close in the area of highest density , differing by about a half unit of inverse rate , ie , 1 2b = 1 . Fourth : pdf of a Gamma distribution with a = 0.3 and b = 05 The geometric and arithmetic expectations are shown as vertical lines ( the mode is undefined ) . The two quantities differ greatly , with G [ θ ] much closer to zero and in an area of higher density . If these expectations were used as point estimates to predict the presence or absence of a rare event—eg , y = 0 if ˆθ < 0.5 ; otherwise y = 1—they would yield different predictions .
When performing NTF by minimizing the generalized KL divergence of reconstruction ˆY from observed tensor Y ( which is equivalent to MLE for PTF ) , the multiplicative update equation introduced by Lee and Seung for , eg , θ(1 ) ik is j,a,t θ(2 ) jk θ(3 ) j,a,t θ(2 ) ak θ(4 ) jk θ(3 ) tk ak θ(4 ) tk yijat ˆyijat
θ(1 ) ik := θ(1 ) ik

These update equations sometimes converge to locally nonoptimal values when the observed tensor is very sparse [ 8 , 22 , 2 ] . This problem occurs when factors are set to inadmissible zeros ; the algorithm cannot recover from these values due to the multiplicative nature of the update equations . Several solutions have been proposed to correct this behavior when minimizing Euclidean distance . For example , Gillis and Glineur [ 7 ] add a small constant to each factor to prevent them from ever becoming exactly zero . For KL divergence , Chi and Kolda [ 2 ] proposed an algorithm—Alternating Poisson Regression—that “ scooches ” factors away from zero more selectively ( ie , some factors are still permitted to be zero ) . In BPTF , point estimates of the latent factors are not estimated directly . Instead , variational parameters for each factor , eg , γ(1 ) ik , are estimated . These parameters then define a Gamma distribution over the factor as in equation ( 2 ) , thereby preserving uncertainty about its value . In practice , this approach solves the instability issues suffered by MLE methods , without any efficiency sacrifice . This assertion is supported empirically by the out ofsample predictive performance results reported in section 5 , but can also be verified by comparing the form of the update in equation ( 11 ) with those of the updates in equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) . Specifically , if equations ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are substituted into the expression for the arithmetic expectation of a single ik for factor θ(1 ) ik and δ(1 )

EQ which is exactly the form of equation ( 11 ) , except that the point estimates of the factors are replaced with two kinds of expectation . This equation makes it clear that the properties that differentiate variational inference for BPTF from the Lee and Seung updates for PTF are 1 ) the hyperparameters α and β(1 ) and 2 ) the use of arithmetic and geometric expectations of the factors instead of direct point estimates . Since the hyperparameters provide a form of implicit correction , BPTF should not suffer from inadmissible zeros , unlike non Bayesian PTF . It is also interesting to explore the contribution of the geometric expectations . The fact that each ˆyijat is defined in terms of a geometric expectation suggests that when constructing point estimates of the latent factors from the variational distribution ( eg , for use in prediction ) , the geometric expectation is more appropriate than the arithmetic expectation ( which is commonly used in Bayesian Poisson matrix factorization ) since the inference algorithm is implicitly optimizing the reconstruction as defined in terms of geometric expectations of the factors . To explore the practical differences between geometric and arithmetic expectations of the latent factors under the variational distribution , it is illustrative to consider the form of Gamma ( θ ; a , b ) . Most relevantly , the Gamma distribution is asymmetric , and its mean ( ie , its arithmetic expectation ) is greater than its mode . When shape parameter a ≥ 1 , Mode ( θ ) = ( a−1 ) ; when a < 1 , the mode is undefined , but most of the distribution ’s probability mass is concentrated near zero—ie , the pdf increases monotonically as θ → 0 . This property is depicted in figure 2 . In this scenario , the Gamma distribution ’s heavy tail pulls the arithmetic mean away from zero and into a region of lower probability . b
The geometric expectation is upper bounded by the arithb = E [ θ ] . Unmetic expectation—ie , G [ θ ] = exp ( Ψ(a ) ) like the mode , it is well defined for a ∈ ( 0 , 1 ) and grows quadratically over this interval , since exp ( Ψ(a ) ) ≈ a2 2 for

As a result , when a < 1 , the geometric expectation yields point estimates that are much closer to zero than those obtained using the arithmetic expectation . When a ≥ 1 , exp ( Ψ(a ) ) ≈ a − 0.5 and the geometric expectation is approximately equidistant between the arithmetic expectation and the mode—ie , a b . These properties are depicted in figure 7 ; the key point to take away from this figure is that when a < 1 , the geometric expectation has a much more probable value than the arithmetic expectation , while when a ≥ 1 , the geometric and arithmetic expectations are very close . This observation suggests that the geometric expectation should yield similar or better point estimates of the latent factors than those obtained using the arithmetic expectation . In table 2 , we provide a comparison of the out of sample predictive performance for BPTF using arithmetic and geometric expectations . Indeed , these results show that the performance obtained using geometric expectations is either the same as or better than the performance obtained instead using arithmetic expectations .
8 . SUMMARY
Over the past fifteen years , political scientists have engaged in an ongoing debate about using dyadic events to study inherently multilateral phenomena . This debate , as summarized by Stewart [ 29 ] , began with Green et al . ’s demonstration that many regression analyses based on dyadic events were biased due to implausible independence assumptions [ 12 ] . Researchers continue to expose such biases , eg , [ 4 ] , and some have even advocated eschewing dyadic data on principle , calling instead for the development of multilateral event data sets [ 26 ] . Taking the opposite viewpoint—ie , that dyadic events can be used conduct meaningful analyses of multilateral phenomena—other researchers , beginning with Hoff [ 16 ] , have developed Bayesian latent factor regression models that explicitly model unobserved dependencies as occurring in some latent space , thereby controlling for their effects in analyses . This line of research has seen an increase in interest and activity over the past few years [ 14 , 29 , 15 ] . In this paper , we too take this latter viewpoint , but instead of focusing on latent factor models for regression , we present a Bayesian latent factor model for predictive and exploratory data analysis—specifically , for identifying and characterizing the “ complex dependence structures in inter national relations ” [ 17 ] implicit in dyadic event data . Our exploratory analysis revealed interpretable multilateral structures that capture both persistent regional relations and temporally localized anomalies . As evidenced empirically by our predictive experiments and analytically by a comparison of our variational inference algorithm with traditional algorithms for performing non negative tensor factorization , Bayesian Poisson tensor factorization overcomes the instability issues exhibited by standard non negative tensor factorization methods when decomposing sparse , dispersed count data . We provided additional analysis and empirical results demonstrating that when constructing point estimates of the latent factors from the variational distribution , the geometric expectation is a more appropriate choice than the arithmetic expectation . We therefore recommend its use in any subsequent work involving variational inference for Bayesian Poisson matrix or tensor factorization .
