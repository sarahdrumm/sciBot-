ABSTRACT More often than not , people are active in more than one social network . Identifying users from multiple heterogeneous social networks and integrating the different networks is a fundamental issue in many applications . The existing methods tackle this problem by estimating pairwise similarity between users in two networks . However , those methods suffer from potential inconsistency of matchings between multiple networks .
In this paper , we propose COSNET ( COnnecting heterogeneous Social NETworks with local and global consistency ) , a novel energy based model , to address this problem by considering both local and global consistency among multiple networks . An efficient subgradient algorithm is developed to train the model by converting the original energy based objective function into its dual form .
We evaluate the proposed model on two different genres of data collections : SNS and Academia , each consisting of multiple heterogeneous social networks . Our experimental results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model . On both data collections , the proposed COSNET method significantly outperforms several alternative methods by up to 10 30 % ( p ≪ 0:001 , t test ) in terms of F1 score . We also demonstrate that applying the integration results produced by our method can improve the accuracy of expert finding , an important task in social networks .

INTRODUCTION
We are facing an era of online with offline ( OWO)—almost everyone is using online social networks to connect friends or , more generally , to satisfy social needs at different levels [ 26 ] . In fact , many users participate in more than one social network , such as public networks and private networks , as well as business networks and family networks . We conducted an interview with 20 graduate students from the authors’ lab . Preliminary statistics show that the average number of social networks in which a user participates is eight . The intentions behind these choices are sophisticated . For example , people may be attracted by different functionalities offered by different social networks . A survey1 in the US shows that two thirds of online adults ( 66 % ) use social media platforms such as Facebook , Twitter , MySpace , or LinkedIn , to stay in touch with current friends , family members , and business partners . Users generate heterogeneous content and also build different ego networks in different social networks . One interesting and important question is : can we automatically integrate the different heterogeneous social networks together ?
The results can benefit many applications in one way or another . For example , if we could correctly integrate different social networks together , we could create an integrated profile for each user , and build a better user interest model . Talentbin2 uses this idea to integrate professional information of an employer that scattered in different social networks to provide a better view of expertise . We can also leverage the integrated results to help social recommendations [ 25 , 32 ] .
The problem is fundamentally important in social network analysis and is also very challenging . First , users’ information in different networks is very unbalanced . Some network may contain rich profile information such as location and interests , while some others may not have any information . Users’ behavior is an important clue ( also referred to as social fingerprint [ 40 ] ) to help recognize users in different networks . If we use the similarity s(u ; v ) ; u 2 G1 ; v 2 G2 between users to link users from two different networks ( G1 and G2 ) , the problem can be formalized as an optimization problem : max u;v s(u ; v ) . The problem can be solved efficiently by using a minimum cost flow algorithm [ 1 , 34 ] . This formulation focuses on local consistency based on user profiles ; however , it does not consider the network structure—an identical user in different networks may have similar ego networks . Finding matches between the users of two networks G1 and G2 can be mapped onto the problem of finding bijection between two networks , a challenging problem in graph theory [ 36 ] . Approximation

1 in G1 has high similarities with v2 can be accomplished using a greedy algorithm . In our problem , this formulation aims to achieve network consistency , also referred to as network matching ( Cf . § 3 ) . However , if we extend this problem to the setting of multiple networks , eg , fG1 ; G2; ; Gkg , only considering local consistency and network consistency is then insufficient . Figure 1 gives an example of connecting three different 1 in G2 and networks . User v1 1 in G3 ( indicated by the green arrows ) , while v3 1 has the highest v3 similarity with v2 3 in G2 . If we match any two networks independently , it can be easily seen that we will have an inconsistent results : 1 $ v3 1 $ v2 1 . An ideal solution to the problem v1 is to consider all pieces of information ( local , network , and global consistencies ) in a unified model and tackle them simultaneously . Despite several studies on various related topics including entity linking [ 22 , 4 , 5 , 20 , 29 ] , entity resolution [ 6 , 13 , 21 , 31 ] , and deanonymization [ 3 ] , the problem of connecting multiple social networks remains largely unsolved . Most existing works focus on estimating pairwise similarity between users from two networks . They ignore either network consistency or global consistency . Some other methods such as [ 20 ] and [ 6 ] consider the network consistency ; however they are still targeting at two networks and do not consider the global consistency among multiple networks . Challenges and Our Solution . The problem of connecting heterogeneous social networks is non trivial and poses a set of challenges . First , how to formulate local , network and global consistencies into a principled optimization model is a challenging issue . Moreover , as real networks are becoming larger and larger with millions of nodes , it is important to develop efficient algorithms that can scale up well . In addition , how to quantitatively validate the usefulness of integrated results is also a challenging task .
To address these challenges , in this paper , we conduct a systematic investigation into the problem of connecting multiple social networks . We formally define the problem and develop a general model to support the integration of an arbitrary number of networks . Our contributions can be summarized as follows : ffl We propose COSNET ( COnnecting heterogeneous Social NETworks with local and global consistency ) , a novel energy based model , to formalize our problem as a unified optimization framework . ffl Solving the proposed optimization model is an intractable problem .

2 . PROBLEM DEFINITION Let G = ( V ; E ; R ) denote a social network , where V = fv1; ; vNg is a set of jV j = N users and E V . V is a set of relationships between users . Each element eij = ⟨vi ; vj⟩ 2 E represents a directed relationship from user vi to user vj . If we consider undirected relationships , then we have eij 2 E , eji 2 E . Each user vi is associated with a d dimensional attribute vector ri ( the i th row in R ) , which can be defined based on the user ’s profile ( eg , interests or posted tweets ) . Given this , we define the input of our problem as follows . Input : The input of our problem consists of a set of m social networks G = fG1 ; G2; ; Gmg , where Gk = ( V k ; Ek ; Rk )

Output : For a user v1 the network G2 2 G , decide whether v1 user in the offline real world . i in the network G1 2 G and a user v2 j in j refer to the same i and v2
A user may have multiple accounts in an online social network , which makes the problem much more complicated . For simplicity , in this work , we assume that one user has at most one account in an online social network .
3 . COSNET : THE PROPOSED MODEL
In Section 2 , we formulated the problem of connecting multiple networks as a binary classification problem , where our goal is to determine whether a pair of users from different networks refer to the same user . There are a lot of factors we can leverage to improve the classification performance . In this section , we propose an energy based model [ 19 ] to jointly consider local user matching , network structure and global consistency . Let X = fxig be a set of user pairs for classification and Y = fyig be the set of corresponding binary labels in f0 ; 1g . yi = 1 means the user pair xi refer to the same user ; otherwise not . We can define an energy function E(Y ; X ) to model the likelihood of a configuration of X and Y . The problem of connecting multiple social networks is to find an optimal configuration Y ⋆ given the user pairs X :
Y ⋆ = arg min
Y 2Y E(Y ; X ) where Y is the value space of the variable of Y . In our case , it is binary , ie , Y = f+1 ; 0gn , respectively representing whether a candidate matching is correct or not .
Figure 2 gives an example to illustrate how we generate candidate user pairs X . For two input networks G1 and G2 , each containing three users , we could generate nine user pairs . Each node in Figure 2(b ) represents a user pair ( candidate matching ) and the edge represents the relationship between two connected nodes ( the corresponding two candidate matchings ) . The relationships are generated according to the neighborhood relationships in the original networks . Thus we could construct a matching graph M G ( as defined below ) . The resultant matching graph might be very large , if the input two networks contain many users . We prune the generated matching graph using heuristics . Figure 2(c ) shows an example of matching graph after pruning . The red edges indicates the one to one matching constraint as we assume that each user has at most one user account in each network .
We will discuss the detailed formulation of the energy function in the following sections . 3.1 Local Matching
First we define some local features for a single user pair xi . We consider the similarity of user profiles , which is widely used in entity linking [ 4 , 5 , 20 , 29 ] and object resolution [ 6 , 13 , 31 ] .
Let gl(xi ; yi ) be a vector valued feature function for encoding the user profile similarity for the user pair xi . We model the local matching energy function as :
∑
⊺ l gl(xi ; yi ) w
El(Y ; X ) = i where wl is a model parameter .
3.2 Network Matching
Local matching deals with each pair of users independently , and does not consider the network structure . To leverage the network structure , we should consider “ neighborhood preserving matchi 2 G1 is matched onto ing ” . The basic idea is that if user v1 j 2 G2 , then we also hope that v1 i ’s neighbors can be also v2 matched to v2 In graph theory , the problem can be reduced to graph isomorphism , where the objective is to find a structure preserving bijection between the vertex sets of two graphs [ 36 ] . j ’s neighbors in G2 .
Here we first introduce the definition of a matching graph , and then we will show how to incorporate the network matching idea into the energy based model .
( MATCHING GRAPH ) . Let V j
DEFINITION 1 i be the j th vertex of the user pair xi where j takes a value in f1 ; 2g . Let N ( v ) be the neighbour set of user v in a social network . Given a set of social networks G and user pairs X , we construct a graph M G = ( VM G ; EM G ) by the following two steps :
1 . For each user pair xi 2 X , construct a corresponding node in VM G .
2 . For two user pairs xi and xj , if V 1 i 2 j ) , then construct an edge in EM G between the nodes i 2 N ( V 1 j ) and V 2
N ( V 2 xi and the nodes xj .
The resulting graph M G is a matching graph given X and G .
Given the definition of matching graph , we model the network matching energy function as :
Ee(Y ; X ) =
⊺ e fe(yi ; yj ) w
( 1 ) where we is a model parameter and fe( ) is an indexing function . When yi and yj takes different binary values , the function fe outputs 1 in one dimension and 0 in others , indicating which combination of yi and yj is activated .
Now we explain why the defined energy function in Eq 1 can leverage the network matching idea . Suppose that the principle of “ neighborhood preserving matching ” is effective in the real world datasets . After we learn the model parameter we from the training data , the weight for yi and yj being the same will be low . For the test set , if two user pairs are connected in the matching graph , the model energy will be low if they are assigned the same label . Therefore , by the definition of the network matching energy model in Eq 1 , we tend to assign the same labels for neighbors in the matching graph to minimize the model energy . 3.3 Global Consistency

Generally , our energy based model with local matching and network matching will work well when we have only two social networks to connect . However , when we have more than two networks , we need to address the inconsistency problem . For example , given three networks G1 , G2 and G3 , connecting and will cause the inconsistency v2 j ; v3 k problem , because the connections did not consider the transitivity of user identities . Formally , we define global inconsistency as follows : without connecting v3 k ; v1 i v1 i ; v2 j

3.4 Model Learning
In this section , we add another energy function into our model to penalize global inconsistency . Ideally , we should consider all possible user pairs sequences in X . However , the number of valid user pairs sequences grows exponentially with the number of users in the networks . Therefore , it is infeasible to directly penalize all the sequences . Instead , we approximately only consider sequence of length 3 in our model . Figure 3 gives an example . Suppose we have three networks G1 , G2 , G3 , and three candidate user pairs among them , ( v1 1 ) , the edges between pairs indicates two user pairs share a user . The three pairs form a triadic closure in the matching graph ( as shown in Figure 3 ) . Thus , we define a triad based energy function for each closed triad in the matching graph .

Let TM G be the set of closed triads in the matching graph M G , we can write the energy function for global consistency as follows :

E(Y ; X ) =
Finally , by combing together local matching , network matching and global consistency , we obtain the following objective function :

Given a labeled training dataset , we aim to learn a parameter configuration W = ( wl ; we ; wt ) from a labeled dataset . We use a maximum margin method for model learning [ 15 , 35 ] . Specifically , we first define the distance of two matching configurations ( Y and Y
) in the energy space as :

Therefore , according to the maximum margin theory [ 12 , 35 ] , our objective function ( Eq 2 ) can be rewritten as a minimization over a regularized hinge loss function :

The constraint can be redefined as

Moreover , by redefining the energy function , we can absorb the distance function ∆( ^Y ; Y ) into E( ^Y ; X ; W ) and E(Y ; X ; W ) [ 14 ] . Finally , the objective function becomes : min W

Dual Decomposition . Solving Eq 4 is an intractable problem . One challenging task is to estimate the energy function E(: ) . To this end , we use Lagrangian relaxation to decompose the function into a set of easy to solve subproblems . Specifically , in our problem , given the input model ( Cf . Figure 2 ) , we decompose the graphical structure into a set of function based subgraphs , each representing a function . Accordingly , we obtain the following decomposition :

To relax these coupling constraints , we introduce a set of Lagrange multipliers = ff i : f 2 F ; yi 2 Yfg

The resulting dual objective function is convex and nondifferentiable , hence it can be solved by the projected subgradient method .

Algorithm 1 summarizes the procedure for learning the model . The model runs in a semi supervised fashion , which means that after learning the model , we can also obtain unknown matchings . Specifically , in each iteration , we first apply the learned parameters to infer unknown matchings Y ⋆ = arg maxY E(Y ; X ) , and then use all the matchings to estimate model parameters W . ∑1 Implementation notes .

In practice , the generated candidate matching graph might be very large . Here , we introduce several strategies for generating the candidate matching graph .
)
1489 Content based method . A straightforward solution is to use the username as the identification to generate seed matchings . Following [ 39 , 40 , 28 ] , we define a similarity function for usernames . Specifically , we tokenize each username ui into a set of segments fui1 ; ui2 ; :::g and then represent each username ui as a TF IDF weighted vector wu . We then calculate the cosine similarity between ui and uj base on their segments , ie sim(ui ; uj ) = wui jj . We then add the user pairs into the candidate set , jjwui if the similarity is above a threshold . To speedup the computation , we also build an inverted index for each username . The similarity is computed only for pairs of usernames that share at least one segment . Finally , a threshold is used to determine whether two usernames belongs to the same user.3

Structure based method . The second method expands candidate matchings base on the network structure . Specifically , based on the seed matchings discovered in the content based method , we propagate the matching along with neighborhood relationships , and iteratively augment the mapping graph with new candidate matchings if their matching scores exceed a threshold2 . Similar ideas have been studied in [ 27 , 38 ] .
Hybrid method . We consider a hybrid of the above two methods to generate candidates . The idea is first to use the content and the structure based methods to generate candidate matchings and then to combine the outputs of the two methods .

We perform experiments on two data collections : SNS and Academia . Each data collection consists of several social networks . In the different networks of each data collection , both the users and the meanings of the relationships in the different networks are very different . Table 3 lists statistics of the two data collections . SNS Network Collection . The SNS data collection consists of five popular online social networking sites : Twitter ( TW ) , LiveJournal ( LJ ) , Flickr ( FL ) , Last.fm ( LA ) , and MySpace ( MS ) .
Twitter : a widely used microblogging service . The Twitter dataset we used in our experiment is obtained from [ 17 ] , and it consists of 40.1 million user profiles and 1.47 billion following relationships among them . Taking user profiles as network nodes , the following relationships allows us to reconstruct the network within them .

MySpace : a social networking website for sharing music . The dataset contains 854,498 user profiles and 6,489,736 directed relationships among users . Academia Network Collection . The Academia data collection consists of three academic or professional social networks : ArnetMiner ( AM ) , LinkedIn ( LI ) and VideoLectures ( VL ) .
ArnetMiner : an expertise search and mining service for the academic community [ 33 ] . We obtained the entire ArnetMiner data up to 2013 , which consists of 1,053,188 user profiles and 3,916,907 co author relationships .
LinkedIn : a professional network , where users can maintain their profiles and social connections . We collected public profiles from LinkedIn . As we cannot crawl user connections on LinkedIn , we pursued another method to construct the network . We consider two profiles to be linked if they were viewed ( “ co viewed ” ) by the same user . In this way , we obtained a network of 2,985,414 user profiles and 25,965,384 relationships .
VideoLectures : an open access educational video lectures repository . The lectures are given by distinguished scholars and scientists at academic events like conferences and summer schools . We obtained lecturers’ profiles from the website . We defined a connection between two researchers as indicating that they attended a particular event ( eg , KDD 2014 ) . This yielded a network of 11,777 lecturer profiles and 786,353 “ co attendance ” relationships . Ground Truth . It is difficult to obtain a “ ground truth ” for evaluating the proposed method . For the SNS network collection , we use the linked user accounts dataset from [ 28 , 8 ] as the “ ground truth ” . The data was originally collected by Perito el . al [ 28 ] through Google Profiles service by allowing users to integrate different social network services . For the Academia network collection , we obtained the “ ground truth ” from ArnetMiner . The ArnetMiner system allows users to connect each author ’s profile to external social networks such as LinkedIn and Facebook . We chose 10,000 authors from ArnetMiner who were connected with LinkedIn profiles and VideoLectures profiles as the ground truth . More precisely , in each data collection , if a user has accounts in two different networks , then we have a ground truth matching . Feature Definition . We now define the local feature functions in Section 3 . We tried to define them with sufficient generality to allow the model to be easily adapted to different data collections . Username similarity and uniqueness : We use Jaro Winkler distance to measure username similarity [ 9 ] . Two accounts with similar usernames are likely to belong to the same person . We also measure how unique the usernames are [ 39 , 28 , 40 , 22 ] . To estimate the uniqueness of a username , we adopt the language model based approach from [ 28 ] . More specifically , we train a Markovchain model based on all the usernames from Twitter and LinkedIn

Profile content similarity : We combine all information related to a profile into one document and convert the document into a bagof words vector , where the words are weighted by TF IDF . The similarity of two profiles is then measured by inner product and cosine distance .
Ego network : To capture the similarity or overlaps between the ego networks of two accounts on different networks , [ 16 ] proposed the notion of extended common neighbors and defined it as the number of known anchor links between two ego networks . Three similarity features are defined between two users’ ego networks using common neighbors , Jaccard ’s coefficient and Adamic/Adar score to measure the similarity between ego networks .
Social status : According to our preliminary analysis of realworld social networks , the status of a user in different social networks tends to be consistent . We use pagerank to measure social status . We sort accounts by pagerank score in each social network and we call the top 1 % accounts “ opinion leaders ” 5 , the following 10 % “ middle class ” , and the rest “ ordinary users ” . Then given a candidate matching ( v1 4.2 Evaluation Metrics and Baselines i ; v2 j ) .
To quantitatively evaluate the proposed model , we consider the following performance metrics : ffl Accuracy . In both data collections , if a method can find a matching between the two networks , we say that the method correctly recognizes a matching ; otherwise , we say that the method makes a wrong recognition . We evaluate the comparison methods in terms of Precision , Recall , and F1 Measure . ffl Application improvement . We apply the obtained matching graph to help expert finding . This will demonstrate how the matching results can benefit other real applications .
Comparison Methods . We compare the following methods for connecting multiple networks .
Name match : This method considers a candidate matching to be correct if and only if the two users have exactly the same name . SVM : This method formalizes the matching problem as a classification problem . It trains a classification model based on the 5Statistics have shown that 1 % of the Twitter users produce 50 % of its content [ 37 ] and control 25 % of the information diffusion [ 24 ] .
( a ) SNS
( b ) Academia
Figure 4 : Performance of integrating two network collections labeled data , and then applies the classification model to classify whether a candidate matching is correct or not . It uses all local features defined in § 4.1 for training the classification model .
MNA [ 16 ] : This method leverages the output score of SVM as the initial pairwise score and then optimize the matching problem by satisfying the one to one constraints .
SiGMa [ 18 ] : This method was designed to align two knowledge bases , by propagating the confidence score in the matching graph . Specifically , it starts from a seed mapping set and iteratively augments the seed set with new matched pairs . We use the result of the Name match method ( by filtering out the most common names ) as the seed set and the output confidence score of SVM as the pairwise similarity for SiGMa .
COSNET : This is the proposed method in the paper , which considers both local consistency and global consistency . To emphasize the importance of global consistency , we also evaluate a variant of the method by removing the global consistency . The variant version is referred to as COSNET , .
4.3 Performance Analysis
We perform experiments on both data collections : SNS and Academia . In our experiments , we randomly partition the groundtruth mappings into five groups and conduct five fold crossvalidation and report the average results . Prediction Performance . Figure 4 shows the overall performance of the comparison methods on the two data collections . The proposed method achieves clearly better performance than the other comparison methods . In terms of F1 score , COSNET achieves a 10 , 30 % improvement over SVM , MNA , and SiGMa . This
1491 Figure 5 : Factor contribution analysis demonstrates that our method , which combines local matching and global consistency is useful .
We also report the evaluation results for each pair of networks . Table 2 lists the detailed performance of each pair of networks . Again , COSNET achieves the best performance in all tasks . SiGMa results in high precision but suffers from a low recall in the SNS dataset . In the Academia dataset , the situation is better , while overall it still underperforms our proposed method . We deepened the analysis and found that SiGMa is good for matching when the input networks have significant overlap ; however it cannot handle the sparsity problem , Thus when the input networks have less overlap , eg , the SNS dataset , it results in very low recall due to its inability to perform propagation . This confirms the necessity of considering global consistency for connecting multiple networks . Factor Contribution Analysis . In the COSNET model , we define five local features based on similarity between users : username similarity ( US ) , username uniqueness ( UN ) , profile content similarity ( PS ) , ego network similarity ( EN ) , and social status ( SS ) . Here we examine the contributions of the different local factors . Specifically , we remove one of the five features from the model , and evaluate the deterioration in its prediction performance . Figure 5 shows the F1 score on the two datasets . We see that different local factors contribute differently in the different data collections . The name uniqueness feature is very helpful in the Academia data collection , but not that useful in the SNS data collection . This is probably because the name uniqueness feature can effectively address the name ambiguity problem in the Academia data collection . Effects of Global Consistency . One important feature of our proposed COSNET model is that it is able to preserve global consistency . We now investigate how global consistency helps improve matching performance . As shown in Figure 4 and Table 2 , COSNET , represents the performance of our method without considering global consistency . We see that without considering global consistency , the overall performances drop significantly ( 2 % and 7 % ; p value≪ 0.01 , t test ) on both data collections . We see that the major problem of COSNET , is a drop in precision . This is reasonable , as global consistency can help improve precision when dealing with more than two networks . Effects of Number of Social Networks . Intuitively , the more networks involved , the greater the improvements we can obtain by considering the global consistency . To verify the effectiveness of global consistency when dealing with different number of social networks . We evaluate the average performance of COSNET by varying the number of social networks in SNS . Specifically , we first consider two networks . In this case , COSNET degrades to COSNET , . Then we increase the number of networks to three , four , and five , and report the average F1 score of COSNET for matching the multiple networks . Figure 6 shows the average perfor

( a ) Coverage rate
( b ) Negative rate
Figure 7 : Performance of candidate generation and pruning . mance of COSNET when varying the number networks involved in the SNS data collection . The results validate our intuition regarding global consistency . Effects of Candidate Pruning . We evaluate the performance of candidate generation in terms of coverage rate ( the number of known positive candidates divided by the number of ground truth mappings ) and negative rate ( the number of known negative candidates divided by the sum of the number of known positive and negative candidates ) . Figure 7 shows the coverage rate and negative rate in each candidate generation strategy described in § 34 In most cases , propagation can significantly increase the coverage of candidates with a reasonable number of errors . We also note that the propagation algorithm failed to output desirable candidates on AM VL and LI VL . This might be because the dense coattendance relationships in VideoLectures cannot reflect real world relationships among researchers . 4.4 Application Improvement
We turn now to evaluating the performance improvement when applying the model output to expert finding [ 33 ] . Recall that the goal of expert finding is to identify persons with some expertise or experience on a specific topic ( query ) q . The experiment is conducted on an Academia dataset used in [ 41 ] , which consists of 14,134 researchers . Four vaule scores ( 3 , 2 , 1 , and 0 ) are manually labeled to represent definite expertise , expertise , marginal expertise , and no expertise . All the researchers have accounts on ArnetMiner , and according to our integration result , 5,374 of them have been successfully mapped to the LinkedIn network . We construct an integrated social graph of ArnetMiner and LinkedIn by simply appending the profile content and relationships of the mapped accounts on LinkedIn to the ArnetMiner network . Recall that in LinkedIn , the edges indicates the “ co viewed ” relationship between users which can be regarded as indicating that the corresponding users are similar in terms of their expertise . As an example , Philip
1492 removal to map usernames from a base community to a target community . Peritio et al . [ 28 ] estimated the uniqueness of usernames with a Markov chain model . The recent work by Zafarani et al . [ 40 ] conducted a more in depth investigation of this problem . They defined sophisticated features , such as knowledge limitation and typing patterns , to model the behavior patterns of users in selecting usernames . Liu et al . [ 22 ] leveraged rare usernames to create training instances for user identification . Liu et al . [ 23 ] explored the social identity linkage problem based on user behavior modeling . They proposed a method to incorporate user attributes , user generated content , and social activities to link user accounts in different social networks .
The above methods only considered local similarity of account pairs . Zhang et al . [ 16 ] formulated the problem as an anchorlink prediction task . Their method resolved one to one mapping conflicts and issues from encountered structural features , but was limited to pairwise mapping . Tan et al . [ 30 ] used hypergraph to model social relationships and proposed a manifold alignment framework to map users from different networks onto a common low dimension space . Cui et al . [ 11 ] studied the problem of finding email correspondents in social networks . Their approach integrated profile similarity and graph based similarity and successfully found a mapping between the Facebook network and an email network .
Most of the above work focuses on estimating pairwise similarity between users from two networks . However , they do not consider global consistency among mappings of multiple networks . Entity Linking and Disambiguation . Linking entities from different information sources is an important and extensively studied problem in data integration . Bellare [ 5 ] proposed an active sampling approach to improve entity matching results . Bai et al . [ 4 ] leveraged user clicks for automatic seed generation in entity matching . Lacoste et al . [ 18 ] proposed a greedy method that successfully aligned two large scale knowledge bases . Cucerzan et al . [ 10 ] presented a large scale named entity disambiguation system that leverages information extracted from Wikipedia . Kataria et al . [ 13 ] developed an entity disambiguation framework based on a hierarchical topic model . There is also research studying the privacy issue across multiple social networks . For example , Backstrom et al . [ 3 ] presented the processes where one can identify individuals in anonymized networks by either manipulating networks before they are anonymized or by having prior knowledge about certain anonymized nodes . Narayanan et al . [ 27 ] successfully deanonymized the interlinks between two real world social networks based on only the network topology .
6 . CONCLUSIONS

Yu has co viewed relationships with Wei Wang , Jian Pei , Charu Aggarwal , Jiawei Han , Hui Xiong , Vipin Kumar , etc . These people are not necessarily coauthors of Philip , but their expertise is similar . Our goal here is to leverage the external network , LinkedIn , to help improve expert finding in ArnetMiner .
To quantify the effectiveness of the integration result , we perform expert finding on both ArnetMiner ’s coauthor network and the integrated social graph . For fair comparison , we use the same algorithm in [ 33 ] which is a combination of language model and random walks . Specifically , we calculate the expertise score of an author for a given query based on language model , and propagate the score in the network using random walks . With the integrated social graph ( by matching ArnetMiner and LinkedIn ) , we have more “ co viewed ” relationships to propagate the expertise scores .
We evaluate the performance in terms of precision@5 ( P@5 ) , P@10 , P@20 , R precision ( R Pre ) , and mean average precision ( MAP ) [ 7 ] . Figure 1(c ) shows the result of expert finding , on the ArnetMiner network only , and on the integrated networks . We see that the external network information from LinkedIn can significantly improve the performance of expert finding ( +5 10 % by Precision@5 ) . This confirms the effectiveness of connecting different networks in real applications . 4.5 Prototype System
We have developed and deployed a web application for an integrated social network based on the proposed COSNET method . The system integrates LinkedIn and VideoLectures with ArnetMiner . As a result , we have successfully discovered 237,842 matched pairs between LinkedIn and ArnetMiner and 8,932 between VideoLectures and ArnetMiner ( representing 85 % of the profiles on VideoLectures ) . We use the profile content from LinkedIn and videos from VideoLectures to enrich the corresponding user profile on ArnetMiner . Figure 8 shows an example author profile on ArnetMiner.6 The top of the figure shows the integrated external relationships , and the profile content from LinkedIn has been used to enrich the corresponding user profile on ArnetMiner . The bottom lists videos from VideoLectures .
