ABSTRACT Directed links { representing asymmetric social ties or interactions ( eg , \follower followee" ) { arise naturally in many social networks and other complex networks , giving rise to directed graphs ( or digraphs ) as basic topological models for these networks . Reciprocity , defined for a digraph as the percentage of edges with a reciprocal edge , is a key metric that has been used in the literature to compare different directed networks and provide \hints" about their structural properties : for example , are reciprocal edges generated randomly by chance or are there other processes driving their generation ? In this paper we study the problem of maximizing achievable reciprocity for an ensemble of digraphs with the same prescribed in and out degree sequences . We show that the maximum reciprocity hinges crucially on the in and outdegree sequences , which may be intuitively interpreted as constraints on some \social capacities" of nodes and impose fundamental limits on achievable reciprocity . We show that it is NP complete to decide the achievability of a simple upper bound on maximum reciprocity , and provide conditions for achieving it . We demonstrate that many real networks exhibit reciprocities surprisingly close to the upper bound , which implies that users in these social networks are in a sense more \social" than suggested by the empirical reciprocity alone in that they are more willing to reciprocate , subject to their \social capacity" constraints . We find some surprising linear relationships between empirical reciprocity and the bound . We also show that a particular type of small network motifs that we call 3 paths are the major source of loss in reciprocity for real networks .

INTRODUCTION
Many complex networks are naturally directed , which endows them with nontrivial structural properties not shared by undirected networks . One such property that has been widely studied is reciprocity , which is classically defined as the fraction of edges that are reciprocated , ie paired with an edge of the opposite direction . Nontrivial patterns of reciprocity can reveal possible mechanisms of social , biological or other nature that systematically act as organizing principles shaping the observed network topology [ 6 ] . Previous work shows that reciprocity plays an important role in many information networks such as email networks [ 16 ] , the World Wide Web [ 2 ] and Wikipedia [ 29 , 28 ] . It is also shown that major online social networks that are directed in nature , such as Twitter[10 , 12 ] , Google+[14 ] , Flickr [ 15 , 4 ] , LiveJournal [ 25 , 15 , 7 ] , and YouTube [ 15 ] , all exhibit a nontrivial amount of reciprocity .
When we try to interpret observed values of reciprocity , we are faced with the problem of assessing the significance of the observation . For instance , the Swedish Wikipedia has reciprocity of 21 % . How significant is this ? This question is often answered by comparing measured values with the expected value of some null model . One commonly used null model is a random graph with the same number of nodes and edges [ 16 ] . An alternative is a random graph with specified degree sequence , as the specific degree sequence is expected to affect reciprocity [ 26 ] . Networks are then classified as reciprocal or anti reciprocal according to whether the observed reciprocity is larger or smaller than the expected value [ 6 ] . Significant deviation from the expected values suggests the existence of some underlying organizational mechanism at work . For our example of Swedish Wikipedia , the expected reciprocities in both random null models are almost zero , so the Swedish Wikipedia is classified as a reciprocal network . Informative as this might be , comparison with expected values is not the whole story . Is 21 % a significant deviation from 0 ? Can we say that the tendency to reciprocate is strong in this network ? The answer might depend on the eye of the beholder . However , if we know for some reason the maximum possible reciprocity is only 28 % , then we may safely conclude that 21 % is indeed a significant amount of reciprocity . On the other hand , if the maximum is 90 % , we might conclude that 21 % is not as significant as suggested by the comparison with random null models . In general , knowledge of the extremal values can give a better idea about where the observation lies in the entire spectrum , which can potentially change our conclusion about the significance level of the observation .
457 Since real social networks often exhibit reciprocities larger than those associated with the random null models , we concern ourselves only with the maximum achievable reciprocity in this work . As in the random null models , we may want to retain certain key structural features of the real network when we maximize reciprocity . The particular feature that we choose to preserve in this work is the joint in and outdegree sequence , which is a confounding factor in the study of reciprocity [ 26 ] . In real networks , in and out degrees often serve as proxies for some kind of capacities of the corresponding node . For example , in a file sharing network where edges represent transfers from file sources to downloaders , the in degree of a node can reflect the available network bandwidth and the out degree the amount of resource . In a social network where edges point from followers to followees , the in degree of a node can reflect its fame and popularity and the out degree its budget of attention . Quite often these capacity constraints are too important to be ignored in the network under consideration . By preserving the degree sequence , we honor these capacity constraints , thus controlling these confounding factors .
Motivated by the above considerations , we study the problem of maximizing reciprocity subject to prescribed joint inand out degree constraints . This paper makes the following contributions . ffl We formulate the maximum reciprocity problem and prove its NP hardness . We provide an upper bound on reciprocity and conditions for achieving the bound . ffl We show that empirical reciprocity is surprisingly close to the upper bound in a wide range of real networks . We also find surprisingly strong linear relationships between empirical reciprocity and the upper bound . ffl We identify some suboptimal network motifs and show that a particular type of small motif called 3 paths is the major cause for suboptimality in real networks .
The rest of the paper is organized as follows . Section 2 introduces the maximum reciprocity problem . Section 3 proves the NP hardness of the problem , and provides a simple upper bound for maximum reciprocity . Section 4 identifies patterns of maximum digraphs and provides a greedy algorithm for eliminating suboptimal motifs . Section 5 conducts some empirical study of real networks and Section 6 concludes the paper .
2 . GRAPHIC SEQUENCES AND MAXIMUM
RECIPROCITY PROBLEM
In this section , we first introduce the notion of a graphic sequence for undirected graphs and then a graphic bi sequence for directed graphs or digraphs for short , which will be used in the theoretical analysis of Section 3 . We then formulate the maximum reciprocity problem . Throughout the rest of the paper , a graph , directed or not , always means a simple graph , ie no self loops or multiple edges are allowed . We will use the terms node and vertex interchangeably . For directed graphs , an edge always means a directed edge . 2.1 Graphic Sequence and Bi sequence
For an undirected graph G = ( V ; E ) , the degree dG(v ) of a node v is the number of edges incident to v . Associated with every graph G is its degree sequence d = fdG(v ) : v 2 V g .
However , not every sequence of nonnegative integers can be realized as the degree sequence of a graph . When it is realizable , the sequence is called graphic . More precisely , a sequence of nonnegative integers d = ( d1 ; d2 ; : : : ; dn ) is called graphic if there exists a graph G with nodes v1 ; v2 ; : : : ; vn such that dG(vi ) = di for i = 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; n . The following classical theorem of Erd}os and Gallai characterizes graphic sequences . ∑ ( Erd}os Gallai ) . A sequence of nonnegative integers d1 d2 dn is graphic if and only if k∑ n∑
Theorem 1 n i=1 di is even and di k(k , 1 ) + minfdi ; kg ; for k = 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; n : i=1 i=k+1
The graphicality of a sequence can be tested in linear time using the Erd}os Gallai theorem [ 9 ] .

G(v ) : v 2 V g is the out degree sequence and d
For a digraph G = ( V ; E ) , a node has both an in degree , and an out degree . The in degree d G(v ) of a node v is the number of directed edges coming into v , and the out degree d+ G(v ) is the number of directed edges going out of v . Associated with every digraph G is a bi sequence ( d+ ; d ) , where d+ = fd+ = fd G(v ) : v 2 V g is the in degree sequence . As in the undi , rected case , not every bi sequence of nonnegative integers can be realized by a digraph . A bi sequence of nonnegative n )g is , integers ( d+ ; d called graphic if there exists a digraph G with nodes v1 , , v2 ; : : : ; vn such that d+ for i i = 1 ; 2 ; : : : ; n .

In this subsection , we formulate the maximum reciprocity problem . For notational simplicity , we henceforth make no distinction between a graph ( digraph ) and its edge set when no confusion arises . Given a digraph G , let Gs be the symmetric subgraph of G , ie ( i ; j ) 2 Gs if and only if both ( i ; j ) 2 G and ( j ; i ) 2 G . The reciprocated edges of a digraph G are precisely those of Gs . Thus the number fl(G ) of reciprocated edges in G is given by fl(G ) = jGsj , and the reciprocity of G is r(G ) := fl(G)=jGj . Note that we use jGj to denote the number of edges in G and each pair of reciprocal edges contributes two to fl(G ) .
Given a graphic bi sequence ( d+ ; d
) denote the nonempty set of graphs that have ( d+ ; d ) as their degree bi sequence . Since the total number of edges is fixed for a given graphic bi sequence , maximizing r(G ) is the same as maximizing fl(G ) . The maximum reciprocity problem is then to find a digraph G in G(d+ ; d , ) with maximum fl(G ) , ie

, maximize fl(G ) subject to G 2 G(d+ ; d ,

3 . HARDNESS ANALYSIS AND BOUNDS
In this section , we first provide an upper bound for the maximum number of reciprocated edges allowed by a graphic bi sequence . We then prove that the maximum reciprocity problem is NP hard by showing that it is NP complete to decide the achievability of the upper bound . Some sufficient conditions for achieving the upper bound are then provided . 3.1 Upper Bound for Reciprocity
In this subsection , we first establish a simple upper bound on the maximum number of reciprocal edges in terms of the total imbalance of the graphic bi sequence , along with necessary conditions for achieving this upper bound . Some examples are provided to illustrate how the necessary conditions may fail and that they are not sufficient , which provides insight into why the bound is not always tight .
Figure 1 : Graphic bi sequence with non graphic max and min sequences .
,
Example 2 . In Figure 2 , the min sequence d+ ^ d , is graphic , while the max sequence d+ _ d , is not . No reciprocity is allowed by this bi sequence , ie fl(d+ ; d ) = 0 , , while the upper bound gives fi(d+ ; d ) = 2n , so the gap can be arbitrarily large . The only unbalanced nodes s and r have very large unbalanced degrees that cannot be absorbed by themselves , as a consequence of which some , in fact all , balanced degrees have to be used for absorbing unbalanced degrees rather than forming reciprocal edges .
,
Example 3 . In Figure 3 , the max sequence d+ _ d , is graphic , while the min sequence d+ ^ d is not . As in Example 2 , no reciprocity is allowed here , ie fl(d+ ; d ) , while the upper bound is fi(d+ ; d ) = 2n . The situation is , however , the opposite . Node 0 has too large a balanced degree relative to the number of nodes with nonzero balanced degrees , which is one here . Thus some of the balanced degrees have to be absorbed by the unbalanced degrees .
,
,
The common pattern in Examples 2 and 3 is that there are a small number of nodes with extremely large degrees . In the social network context , these nodes correspond to celebrities

We saw in the previous subsection that the upper bound may not be achievable . Unfortunately , the next theorem shows that it is NP complete to decide whether the upper bound is achievable , which means the maximum reciprocity problem is NP hard .

Proof . Note that the problem is the same as the existence problem of a digraph G 2 G(d+ ; d ) with fl(G ) = fi(d+ ; d ) . This problem is in NP , since given a digraph G , we can verify whether fl(G ) = fi(d+ ; d ) in polynomial time . To show that the problem is NP hard , we adapt the proof of Lemma 5 in [ 5 ] by reduction from the 3 color tomography problem , which is shown to be NP hard therein . Recall that the 3 color tomography problem is as follows . Given nonnegative integral vectors rw ; rb 2 Nn , and sw ; sb 2 Nm that satisfy i m ; n∑ for 1 i n ; 1 j m ; j n ; m∑ rw i + rb sw j + sb and rc i = sc j ; for c 2 fw ; bg ; i=1 j=1 decide if ( rw ; rb ; sw ; sb ) is feasible , ie there exists a matrix M with entries in fw ; b ; gg such that for c 2 fw ; bg : i = jfj : Mij = cgj ; rc Let ( rw ; rb ; sw ; sb ) be an n . m instance of the 3 color j = jfi : Mij = cgj ; sc tomography problem . For 1 i n and 1 j m , let i + n , 1 ; ∑ d+ i = rw , i = rw d i + rb i + n , 1 ; n+j = sw d+ j ; , j + sb n+j = sw j : d

) = fi(d+ ; d
First assume that M is a solution to the 3 color tomography instance . We construct a digraph G as follows . For 1 i n and 1 j m , let Wij = 1 if Mij = w , and Bij = 1 if Mij = b . Let J be an n . n matrix with all off diagonal entries equal to 1 and diagonal entries equal to 0 . Let the adjacency matrix of G be

This theorem is analogous to Theorem 2.2 in [ 3 ] , which deals with packing two graphic sequences for undirected graphs . Theorem 4 deals with packing a graphic sequence d0 for undirected graphs and a graphic bi sequence ( d+ , , , d0 ) for digraphs . The proof closely follows that of d0 ; d Theorem 2.2 in [ 3 ] and can be found in [ 11 ] . Applying Theorem 4 with d0 = d+ ^ d ,

Note that ∆ is the maximum of either the in or outdegrees . Putting an upper bound on ∆ rules out extremely large degrees , which are the trouble makers in the examples of Section 31 However , in most real networks , we have ffi = n , 1 , so the sufficient condition essentially requires ∆ < which , unfortunately , usually fails to hold . In fact , it fails for most networks studied in Section 5 . p
4 . PATTERNS IN MAXIMUM DIGRAPHS In this section , we identify some structural patterns of maximum digraphs , or equivalently , the associated suboptimal structures that contribute to the loss in reciprocity not imposed by the degree bi sequence . We first look at some small suboptimal motifs and provide a greedy algorithm to eliminate them . We then show some more complicated structural patterns of maximum digraphs and demonstrate how they can help us pin down the maximum digraphs in some special cases . Omitted proofs can be found in [ 11 ] . Throughout this section , a cycle or a path always refers to a directed cycle or directed path , ie the edges must be all in the same direction as we follow the cycle or path . We also require that the edges be distinct . On the other hand , the vertices are not necessarily distinct . When the vertices are distinct , we say the path or cycle is elementary . 4.1 Small Suboptimal Motifs
In this subsection , we focus on a particular type of small motifs that we call 3 paths , the nonexistence of which also guarantees the nonexistence of many larger scale suboptimal structures . As we will see in Section 5 , elimination of such suboptimal motifs brings reciprocity close to the corresponding upper bound for a variety of real world networks . Given a digraph G , we call an elementary path of length 3 , = ( v0 ; v1 ; v2 ; v3 ) , a 3 path if ( vi ; vi+1 ) 2 Ga for i = 0 ; 1 ; 2 , ie , consists entirely of unreciprocated edges . We further classify 3 paths into the following four types according to the connectivity between v0 and v3 ( Figure 5 ) , ( I ) . ( v0 ; v3 ) =2 Gu , ie there is no edge between v0 and v3 ; ( II ) . ( v0 ; v3 ) 2 Gs ; ( III ) . ( v3 ; v0 ) 2 Ga , ie ( v0 ; v1 ; v2 ; v3 ; v0 ) is a 4 cycle ; ( IV ) . ( v0 ; v3 ) 2 Ga .
As shown in Figure 5 , 3 paths of Types I , II and III are suboptimal and can be rewired locally to increase reciprocity . We say a digraph is 3 path optimal if it has no 3 path of Type I , II or III . Note that when viewed as a transformation on Ga , the rewiring procedure in Figure 5 simply eliminates 4 cycles ( Type III ) , and replaces open 3paths by a shortcut from its first vertex to its last vertex if such a shortcut does not yet exist ( Types I and II ) . Thus each rewiring increases the number of reciprocated edges by either 2 or 4 , and we have the following
Lemma 1 . A maximum digraph is 3 path optimal .
Given a digraph G , we can greedily rewire all 3 paths to get a lower bound on the maximum reciprocity allowed by the degree bi sequence of G . The resulting greedy algorithm is shown in Algorithm 1 . Lemma 2 guarantees that Algorithm 1 eliminates all 3 paths of Types I , II and III .

Lemma 2 . Algorithm 1 returns a 3 path optimal digraph .
Note that depending on how v0 and are picked , Algorithm 1 can return different 3 path optimal graphs . Although there is no theoretical guarantee , we will see in Section 5 that reciprocities of 3 path optimal digraphs returned by Algorithm 1 are very close to the corresponding upper bounds and hence close to the maxima as well . The next subsection shows that 3 path optimality precludes many other suboptimal structures , which partially explains why Algorithm 1 works pretty well in practice . 4.2 Properties of Maximum Digraphs
In this subsection , we consider additional suboptimal structures that are more complicated than 3 paths . Some of these structures are automatically eliminated by Algorithm 1 , while others require extra attention . We will state the results as properties of maximum digraphs . Any violation of the stated properties yields a suboptimal structure .
421 3 path optimal digraphs We first consider some properties of 3 path optimal digraphs , which , by Lemma 1 , are also properties of maximum digraphs . All these properties involve only unreciprocated edges . Note that any suboptimal structures that violate these properties are automatically eliminated by Al gorithm 1 . Let G denote a 3 path optimal digraph throughout this subsection .
Lemma 3 shows that the unreciprocated edges of a 3 path optimal digraph cannot form any elementary path of odd length without a shortcut . As a result , for any two vertices u and v , either there is no path from u to v in Ga , or there is such a path of length at most 2 .
Lemma 3 . If = ( v0 ; v1 ; : : : ; v2p+1 ) is an elementary path of odd length in Ga , then ( v0 ; v2p+1 ) 2 Ga .
Lemma 4 shows that the anti symmetric subgraph of a 3 path optimal digraph is almost cycle free . We can obtain a directed acyclic graph from it by removing an edge from each 3 cycle .
Lemma 4 . The only possible cycles in Ga are 3 cycles , and any two of them must be vertex disjoint .
Although 3 path optimality does not preclude 3 cycles , they are unlikely to exist in 3 path optimal graphs obtained from real world networks using Algorithm 1 , as Lemma 5 requires that the vertices of a 3 cycle in such graphs have exactly the same connectivity to every vertex outside the 3cycle , which is extremely unlikely , especially in large graphs .
Lemma 5 . For a 3 cycle C in Ga and any vertex v not in C , either there is no path in Ga that connects v and C , or there is an edge of Ga between v and each vertex of C , all in the same direction . 422 Maximum digraphs In this subsection , we consider some properties of maximum digraphs that are not direct consequences of 3 path optimality . The associated suboptimal structures may be left intact by Algorithm 1 and require extra attention . Throughout this subsection , let G⋆ denote a maximum digraph with a given bi sequence ( d+ ; d ) and fl(G⋆ ) = fl(d+ ; d ie G⋆ 2 G(d+ ; d ,

) .

We know from Lemma 4 that large cycles involving only unreciprocated edges are suboptimal structures , but certain cycles of even length that contains reciprocated edges are also suboptimal . In particular , we have the following Lemma 6 . Let C be an even cycle in H 2 G(d+ ; d
) . If any two edges in C \ Hs are separated by an odd number of ′ 2 G(d+ ; d , ′ ) = edges in C , then there exists H fl(H ) + jCaj , 2jCa \ Hsj , where Ca is the anti symmetric part of C , ie Ca = f(i ; j ) 2 C : ( j ; i ) =2 Cg .
) with fl(H
Note that C \ Ha fl Ca , but it is not necessarily true that Ca = C \ Ha . The two edges ( 3 ; 4 ) and ( 5 ; 0 ) in Figure 6(a ) are in Ca but not in C \ Ha . Any cycle satisfying the conditions in Lemma 6 is suboptimal if it has more anti symmetric edges than symmetric ones . The cycles ( 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 ; 0 ) in Figure 6(a ) and ( 0 ; 1 ; 2 ; 0 ; 5 ; 3 ; 4 ; 5 ; 0 ) in Figure 6(b ) are two such examples . Note that these two cycles are not automatically eliminated by Algorithm 1 .
Lemma 7 specifies how multiple 3 cycles should be connected in maximum digraphs . If we collapse each 3 cycle into a single vertex by contracting its edges , the subgraph of G⋆ a induced by these vertices will have the structure in Figure 4 . Therefore , while the existence of multiple 3 cycles is already very unlikely in 3 path optimal digraphs , it is even less likely in maximum digraphs with degree bi sequences of real world networks .

Lemma 8 . Let = ( v0 ; v1 ; : : : ; v2p ) be an elementary path a , E0 = f(v2i ; v2j ) : i ̸= jg and of even length 2p 4 in G⋆ E1 = f(v2i,1 ; v2j,1 ) : i ̸= jg . If ( v0 ; v2p ) =2 G⋆ a , then G⋆ either has all the edges in E0 but none in E1 , or vice versa .
Figure 7 shows both possibilities for an elementary path of length 4 . The shortcuts required by Lemma 3 are also shown . The red dashed edges represent those that cannot coexist with the green edges in a maximum digraph . Some suboptimal structures that violate Lemma 8 cannot be automatically eliminated by Algorithm 1 . For example , if the pair of edges between the vertices 0 and 2 are missing from Figure 7(a ) , the resulting suboptimal digraph will be left intact by Algorithm 1 .

4.3 Some Examples
In this subsection , we illustrate how the structural patterns of the previous subsection may be used to pin down the maximum digraph in some special cases . Here G⋆ always denotes a maximum digraph .
Proposition 2 shows that when the bi sequence is perfectly balanced , the maximum digraph achieves perfect or nearperfect reciprocity . Therefore , any unfulfilled reciprocity must be due to the lack of effort to form reciprocal edges rather than due to the fundamental limit imposed by the bi sequence itself .

Proof . Since ( d+ ; d for all i . Thus any edge of G⋆ a must be contained in a cycle of length at least 3 in G⋆ a . By Lemma 4 , the length of such a cycle is exactly 3 . By Lemma 7 , there is at most one such cycle in a is either empty or a 3 cycle . Since fl(G⋆ ) must G⋆ be even , the former case corresponds to even "(d+ ; d ) and the latter odd "(d+ ; d a . Thus G⋆

The next proposition shows that when the bi sequence is , slightly unbalanced , the number of possible values of fl(d+ ; d increases . This sheds some light on why the maximum reciprocity problem is so difficult . As the total unbalanced degree increases , the number of possibilities is expected to explode .

5 . EMPIRICAL STUDY
In this section , we conduct an empirical analysis of real networks by comparing the observed values of reciprocity against the upper bounds . We also look at the lower bounds on maximum reciprocities given by Algorithm 1 . 5.1 Datasets
The networks that we analyze include major online social networks ( OSN ) that are directed in nature [ 15 , 12 , 8 , 24 , 13 ] . For the purpose of comparison , we have also included other types of networks : biological networks [ 20 , 21 , 18 , 23 , 19 , 27 ] , communication networks [ 13 ] , product co purchasing networks [ 13 ] , web graphs [ 13 ] , Wikipedias [ 1 ] , software call graphs [ 22 , 17 ] , and P2P networks [ 13 ] . All the datasets except for Wikipedias are already converted into graph representations by other researchers and the descriptions for the datasets can be found at the cited sources . For Wikipedias , each node represents a page . Only article pages , ie pages with namespace ID 0 , are included . Pages that redirect to the same page are represented as a single node corresponding to the destination page . There is an edge from node A to node B if there is at least one hyperlink from page A to page B . Multiple edges and self loops are discarded . 5.2 Empirical Reciprocity vs . Upper Bound

,
,
)="(d+ ; d
Figure 10 shows the scatter plot of empirical reciprocities against the corresponding upper bounds . Here the upper bound is normalized by the number of edges , ie , it is the ratio fi(d+ ; d ) . Note that the reciprocity values vary widely , ranging from 0 for the peer to peer network Gnutella to 90 % for the online social network Slashdot . There is even a fair amount of variation within the categories of biological , social and Wikipedia networks . In general , social networks and Wikipedia networks tend to have high reciprocity , while software call networks tend to have low reciprocity . Note the strong linear correlation between empirical reciprocity and the upper bound . This is a bit surprising , especially for the social networks , in view of the large variations in reciprocity . Related to Figure 10 is the scatter plot in Figure 11 of number of reciprocated edges against the unnormalized bound fi(d+ ; d ) . There the linear relationship in log log scale is even more apparent , with biological networks being also around the regression line . These linear relationships suggest that there might exist some universal mechanism that works across different domains .
,
Despite the wide variation in reciprocity , the ratio between the empirical reciprocity and the normalized upper bound has a much narrower range as shown by the box plots for the ratios in Figure 12 .
Note that the ratios are close to zero for the P2P network Gnutella and software call graphs . The Gnutella exhibits zero reciprocity , far away from the upper bounds , which are above 30 % . This is probably because Gnutella implements an indirect reciprocity mechanism . The low reciprocity for software call graphs is not surprising , as software codes are usually designed to work in a hierarchical manner . The case for biological networks are more complicated , as the four biological networks considered here are actually of quite different natures . For example , the C . Elegan neural network and the mouse cortex network are both neural networks , but the former is at the neuron level while the latter is at a coarser level of cortical regions . One can speculate that upper bound0020406081reciprocity00102030405060708091CEleganmouse cortexprotein interactionyeastATEpinions1Pokecwiki VoteFlickrTwitterego TwitterSlashdot0811Slashdot0902LiveJournal1LiveJournalYouTubeGoogle+ego Google+StackOFDutchPortugueseChineseSwedishSpanishJapaneseEnglishGermanFrenchRussianItalianPolishKoreanemail EuAllwiki TalkBerkStanGoogleNotreDameStanfordy=11x 021biologicalcommunicationco purchasesocialwebwikipediasoftware callp2p464 ples include the web graphs , the Swedish Wikipedia and the Google+ network , whose reciprocities are not very high in absolute value but quite high relative to the bound . This suggests that when we study these networks , it might be more meaningful to ask the question why there is such large imbalance in degrees than to ask the question why the tendency to reciprocate is low . 5.3 Reciprocity of 3 path Optimal Digraphs
In this subsection , we look at 3 path optimal digraphs returned by Algorithm 1 . Note that the reciprocity of such a digraph provides a lower bound on the maximum reciprocity of the corresponding degree bi sequence .
Figure 13 shows the scatter plot of the reciprocities of the 3 path optimal digraphs against the corresponding upper bounds . Note that the reciprocities of 3 path optimal digraphs are very close to the upper bounds , which means that the maximum reciprocities are also very close to the upper bounds . Therefore , for the degree bi sequences of those real networks , the fundamental limit that they impose on reciprocity is largely summarized by the upper bounds , and the major source of loss in reciprocity is the existence of 3 paths of Types I , II and III . Thus in practice Algorithm 1 usually suffices for approximating maximum reciprocities and we do not need to worry much about the more complicated suboptimal structures in Section 422
Figure 11 : Scatter plot of number of reciprocated edges versus upper bound . Regression line was fitted in log scale , without data points for software call networks .
Figure 12 : Box plot of reciprocity bound ratio for different network categories . both the low reciprocity in C . Elegan neural network and the high reciprocity in the mouse cortex network are due to biological reasons . However , we do not know if this behavior is a norm or an exception due to the lack of data for similar networks .
In all categories other than biological , software call and P2P networks , the ratios are above 50 % with only three exceptions : the wiki Vote network , the Stack Overflow Q&A network , and the Spanish Wikipedia . Although we have classified the Stack Overflow Q&A network as a social network , it differs from typical social networks . The low reciprocity suggests that there is a hierarchy of expertise . What is more interesting is the wiki Vote network and the Spanish Wikipedia , as their behaviors deviate from those of other networks of the same category , which suggests that there might be something unusual about them that is worthy of scientific study . Apart from the three outliers , all other networks in these categories actually achieve a significant fraction of the possible reciprocity suggested by the upper bound . This means that modulo the degree constraints , the tendency to reciprocate is much stronger than the empirical reciprocity alone might have suggested . Prominent exam
Figure 13 : Scatter plot of reciprocity of the 3 path optimal digraph returned by Algorithm 1 versus upper bound .
Finally , recall from Section 421 that the existence of 3cycles in a 3 path optimal digraph requires some specific structures . These structures are usually too special to occur in practice , so 3 cycles are unlikely to exist in 3 path optimal digraphs . This is indeed the case for most of the 3 path optimal digraphs obtained from the real networks studied here , the anti symmetric parts of which turn out to be acyclic .
6 . CONCLUSION
In this work , we showed that the maximum reciprocity problem is NP hard . We provided a partial characterization of networks with maximum reciprocity and a greedy algorithm to eliminate suboptimal motifs . We also provided an upper bound on reciprocity along with necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for achieving the bound . We upper bound101103105107109# reciprocated edges100102104106108Stackoverflowy=014x109biologicalcommunicationco purchasesocialwebwikipediasoftware callBioComCoPSocWebWikiCallP2Preciprocity bound ratio00102030405060708091Stackoverflowwiki VoteSpanishupper bound0020406081reciprocity from GreedyRewire00102030405060708091y=xbiologicalcommunicationco purchasesocialwebwikipediasoftware callp2p465 demonstrated that the bound is surprisingly close to the observed reciprocity in a wide range of real networks , which suggests that the tendency to form reciprocal edges might be much stronger than the observed reciprocity indicates . We found surprising linear relationships between empirical reciprocities and the corresponding upper bounds . We showed that a particular type of suboptimal motif called 3 paths is the major source of loss in reciprocity in these networks .
