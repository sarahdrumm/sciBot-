ABSTRACT While most software defects ( ie , bugs ) are corrected and tested as part of the lengthy software development cycle , enterprise software vendors often have to release software products before all reported defects are corrected , due to deadlines and limited resources . A small number of these defects will be escalated by customers and they must be resolved immediately by the software vendors at a very high cost . In this paper , we develop an Escalation Prediction ( EP ) system that mines historic defect report data and predict the escalation risk of the defects for maximum net profit . More specifically , we first describe a simple and general framework to convert the maximum net profit problem to cost sensitive learning . We then apply and compare several well known cost sensitive learning approaches for EP . Our experiments suggest that the cost sensitive decision tree is the best method for producing the highest positive net profit and comprehensible results . The EP system has been deployed successfully in the product group of an enterprise software vendor .

1 . INTRODUCTION Building large enterprise software is generally a highly complex and lengthy process , during which numerous software defects ( ie , bugs ) are reported and required to be corrected or fixed . However , often some of reported defects will not be fixed when the software products are released , due to tight deadlines or limited resources [ 7 ] . After product release a small number of defects become
“ escalated ” by customers , whose businesses are seriously impacted . Escalations of software defects require software vendors’ immediate management attention and senior software engineers’ immediate and continuous effort to reduce the business or financial loss to the customers . Therefore , software defect escalations are highly costly to the software vendors , with the associated costs amounting to millions of dollars each year . In addition , software defect escalations result in loss of reputation , satisfaction , loyalty and repeat revenue of customers , incurring extremely high costs in the long run for the enterprise software vendors [ 2 , 3 ] . Due to time ( ie , deadlines ) and resource limitations , enterprise software vendors can only fix a limited number of defects before product release . Thus , they must try to identify which reported defects have a high risk of escalation , which should be fixed at a much lower cost within the product development and testing cycle before product release . However , identifying software defects that are likely to escalate is a complex and difficult task . Software vendors often have in place human centric processes for evaluating defect reports , but such processes are unreliable and subjective . In this paper we propose a data mining solution to predict escalation risks of defects to assist human experts in the review process of software defects . To the best of our knowledge , applying data mining for predicting software defect escalations is novel in software engineering . More specifically , we build an Escalation Prediction ( EP ) system that learns from history defects data and predicts escalation risk using data mining technology [ 1 , 8 , 12 ] . If the EP system can accurately predict the escalation risk of known defect reports , then many escalations will be prevented . This would save a huge amount of money for the enterprise software vendors [ 6 ] . Indeed , the ultimate business goal of EP ( and many industrial applications using data mining ) is to maximize the “ net profit ” , that is , the difference in the cost before and after introducing the data mining solution , as opposed to the usual data mining measures such as accuracy , AUC ( area under the ROC curve ) , lift , or recall and precision [ 14 ] . However , the net profit is not equivalent to any of these standard machine learning measures [ 5 ] , and we have found little previous work that directly optimizes the net profit as the data mining effort .
We first set up a simple framework in which the problem of maximum net profit can be converted to minimum total cost in cost sensitive learning under certain conditions ( see Section 2 ) . We then apply and compare several well known cost sensitive learning approaches on a defect report dataset to see how they perform , in terms of maximum net profit ( Section 5 ) . The EP system is shown to be able to improve greatly the net profit in software production . The system is currently deployed within the product groups of an enterprise software vendor , and it has quickly become a popular tool for prioritization defects for fixing . EP is one of the successful stories of data mining deployed in industry .
2 . MAXIMUM NET PROFIT AND COSTSENSTITIVE LEARNING In this section we will propose a novel method that converts the maximum net profit problem to cost sensitive learning . As discussed in the Section 1 , correcting defects after an escalation occurs at the customer site is much more expensive than correcting them before product release . However , deadlines and limited resources usually allow only a small number of defects to be fixed at a lower cost before product release . If we treat escalated defects as positive examples and non escalated defects as negative examples , then false negative , or FN , is when EP predicts negative ( non escalation ) but the defect is actually positive ( becomes escalated after product release ) . Thus , the cost of FN ( correcting an escalated defect ) is relatively high . On the other hand , false positive , or FP , is when EP predicts positive ( escalation defects ) but the defect is actually negative ( nonescalation ) . Thus , the cost of FP ( correcting a non escalated defect ) is relatively low ( and is the same as the cost of true positive , TP , or fixing an escalated defect ) . The cost of true negative , TN , is zero . We assume that the cost FN is 7 times as the cost of FP . Further , we assume that FN = $7,000 , and FP = $1,000 ( we did not use the actual numbers here for confidentiality reasons but the actual cost figures are some constant factor of the numbers used here ) . Then the cost metric can be represented in Table 1 . As the cost metric is known , this would seem to be a straightforward cost sensitive learning problem , in which the weighted misclassification cost is minimized .

The problem is not that simple . The goal of the EP ( Escalation Prediction ) system ( and many other real world data mining applications ) is to maximize the net profit after data mining is deployed . That is , we want to maximize the gain ( or difference ) with the data mining effort compared to the previous , default practice . That is , we want to compare the cost ( or profit ) after data mining based EP is deployed to some default policy before EP is deployed . Let us first establish the formula for the net profit , which is the difference of the total costs before and after deploying EP . Let us first calculate the cost after deploying EP ( “ gross profit ” ) . If the software vendor follows faithfully the EP ’s predictions , it will fix all defects predicted positively , and ignore all defects predicted negatively . The cost of correcting all defects predicted positively by EP is thus the multiplication of the number of defects predicated positively and the cost of correcting such a defect ; that is , ( tp+fp)×FP . ( Note that we use small letters , such as tp , to represent the number of true positive cases , and capital letters , such as TP , to represent the cost of true positive cases . Similar notations are used for other cases . ) After the software is released , the would be escalated defects predicted negatively by EP ( ie , false negatives ) will escalate and must be fixed at a much higher cost of fn×FN . Thus , the total cost after deploying EP is the sum of the two costs described above , plus the cost of the data mining effort ( such as the cost of the tool , computer and human cost of using the tool , etc ) . If we ignore the cost of the data mining effort now , then the total cost of deploying EP is :
( tp+fp)×FP+ fn×FN .
( 1 )
Assume that the default policy ( before deploying EP ) is to ignore all defect reports before software release , and then correct all escalated defects after release . Then using the same notation , the cost of this default policy is simply the cost of correcting all escalated defects . That is : ( tp+fn)×FN .
( 2 ) Thus , the net profit is to subtract ( 1 ) from ( 2 ) . That is : Net profit = tp× ( FN–FP)–fp×FP = 6000×tp–1000×fp . ( 3 ) On the other hand , if the default policy is to correct all of the defects ( which rarely happens due to deadlines and scarce resource ) , the cost would be ( tp+fp+tn+fn)×FP . Subtracting ( 1 ) from the cost of the correcting all policy above , the net profit would be : 1000×tn –6000×fn . Thus , in general , the net profit varies with the default policy . We propose a novel and simple approach to convert a formula of maximum net profit ( such as ( 3 ) above ) to cost sensitive learning under certain conditions . Cost sensitive learning basically attempts to minimize the weighted cost , which can be expressed as : tp×TP + fp×FP + tn×TN + fn×FN .
( 4 )
Therefore , as long as the net profit , such as ( 3 ) , can be expressed as a linear formula of tp , fp , tn , and fn , we can negate its coefficients in the linear formula , and re assign the cost metric by the negated coefficients . For example , the cost metric for the net profit ( 3 ) can be converted and represented in Table 2 . In the rest of the paper , we will study EP under this cost metric . Comparing the two cost metrics in Tables 1 and 2 , we can see that one can be converted into the other when the first row is subtracted to the second row [ 11 ] . However , even though the optimal prediction for minimal total cost remains the same after such conversions , the actual value of the total cost ( 4 ) would certainly be changed . That is , the software vendors not only want to know what predictions will produce the maximum net profit , but also the actual value of the net profit , as it reflects how much gain it may actually obtain after the data mining based EP is deployed . Indeed , it is possible that the maximum net profit is negative ( see Table 3 later in Section 5 ) , indicating that it may be counter productive to deploy the data mining system . In addition , as we have omitted the cost of the data mining effort ( such as the tool cost , computer and human cost ) , the software vendor must obtain a positive net profit with a value that is large enough to offset other costs involved and decide if EP is a worthwhile endeavor or not . To conclude , different default policies often result in different net profit calculations . However , under the condition that the net profit can be represented linearly by tp , fp , tn , and fn , we show that a simple and novel method can convert the maximum net profit to a new cost metric . Thus , the maximum net profit problem can now be solved by cost sensitive learning . The result obtained ( actual net profit value ) will be useful for the software vendor to decide the overall benefit of deploying the data mining system . Table 2 : Cost metric converted from ( 3 ) . This cost metric will be used in the rest of the paper .

3 . COST SENSITIVE LEARNING Cost sensitive learning algorithms can be broadly categorized into two types . One is to design a wrapper that converts existing costinsensitive ( or cost blind ) base learning algorithms into costsensitive . The wrapper method is also called cost sensitive metalearning . The other is to design cost sensitive learning algorithms directly [ 19 , 10 , 15 ] . In this section we will discuss briefly several well known cost sensitive including a method of our own ( CSTree , described later ) and several new improvements . Due to space limitation we will not provide full details of each method ; instead , only highlights are given . The first four approaches belong to the wrapper method ; they apply sampling etc . on cost blind base algorithms to make them costsensitive . The last method is cost sensitive by nature . These approaches will be compared experimentally in the next section to see which one(s ) can reliably obtain the maximum net profit in Escalation Prediction . The first popular approach , called “ Undersampling ” in this paper , is to rebalance the training data by sampling the data sets . Previous work ( see , eg , [ 10 ] ) has indicated that over sampling the minority class can cause overfitting , and may not be helpful to improve predictive performance . Other research [ 20 ] shows that keeping all examples of the rare class , and under sampling the majority class to be about the same as the rare class performs well measured by AUC . Thus , we will use this simple strategy . That is , we keep all positive examples ( escalated defects ) , and randomly sample without replacement the negative examples such that the two classes are balanced . However , as the positive examples occupy only about 1 % of the original training and test sets ( see Section 4 ) , the balanced dataset contains only about 2 % of the original training set , which is very small . Therefore , we apply bagging [ 4 ] to Undersampling , as the sample with to the probability proportional bagging has been shown to be effective in improving predictive accuracy and probability estimation measured by AUC . Bagging is also applied to other methods ( see later ) . As Undersampling itself is not cost sensitive , the class label produced cannot be used directly in predicting escalation for maximum net profit . As the base learning algorithms used also produce probability estimates for the labels , testing cases can be ranked . To accurately calculate the maximum net profit , the threshold method is used : a separate validation set is used to find the best threshold on the probability estimates to classify the validation cases that would produce the maximum net profit ( on the validation set ) , and this best threshold is then applied to the test set to classify the test cases into positive ( if the predicted probability is larger than or equal to the threshold ) or negative ( if the predicted probability is less than the threshold ) . The net profit on the test set can then be calculated and obtained . The second approach , called “ Costing ” , is an advanced sampling which weighs examples according to the cost , producing costsensitivity with a provable performance guarantee [ 22 ] . The advanced sampling used is rejection sampling , in which each example in the original training set is drawn once , and is accepted into its “ importance ” . The size of the re sampled dataset is smaller than the original set . With bagging , the method is shown to outperform other methods measured by the maximum total profit in two realworld datasets [ 22 ] . The third approach , called “ Relabeling ” , relabels the classes of instances by applying the minimum expected cost criterion [ 9 ] . MetaCost [ 9 ] belongs to this approach . MetaCost uses bagging as the ensemble method . The forth approach , called “ Weighting ” [ 18 ] , induces costsensitivity by integrating the instances’ weights directly into the classifier building process . It works when the base learners can accept weights directly . This method does not rely on bagging . However , to compare with other cost sensitive methods , we also apply bagging to this method . The fifth approach , called “ CSTree ” , is a recently proposed costsensitive decision tree algorithm that uses the total cost directly as a split criterion [ 15 ] . That is , instead of minimizing entropy in the tree building process , the split criterion simply minimizes the total misclassification cost given a cost metric . CSTree is , by nature , truly cost sensitive , and thus , the result of classifying the test cases is used directly in the calculation of the maximum net profit . Several improvements have been made in the CSTree for the EP application . First of all , compared to [ 15 ] , the costs for true positive ( TP ) and true negative ( TN ) may not be zero here . Second , expected total cost reduction is used during tree building . That is , an attribute may be selected as a root if the expected cost reduction is maximum ( among other attributes ) , and is greater than 0 . More specifically , for a given set of cases without split , if CP ( = tp×TP + fp×FP ) is the total cost of labeling a leaf positively , and CN ( = tn×TN + fn×FN ) is the total cost of labeling a leaf negatively , then the probability of a positive outcome is first estimated by the relative cost of CP and CN as

. ( The smaller the cost CP , the larger the probability of being positive , as minimum cost is sought ) . The expected misclassification cost of being positive thus : . Similarly , the probability of a negative E is

During tree construction , an attribute with the maximum expected cost reduction is chosen , and if the value is greater than 0 , then the attribute is chosen to split the training examples ; if not , a leaf node is formed . The last improvement is tree pruning . The original method did not incorporate pruning . We have found that without pruning , the tree overfits the training examples . This means that a larger tree ( that fits the training examples better ) predicts worse compared to a small tree . We have implemented post pruning similar to the postpruning in C4.5 [ 17 ] in our cost sensitive decision tree ( but our post pruning is guided by minimum total misclassification cost ) . The CSTree has two distinctive advantages . The first one is that there is no need for sampling in the training data . The original training data can be used directly in building the decision tree . That is , CSTree can naturally utilize all information in the training data . Second , CSTree does not rely on bagging for the final outcome . This implies that the final results can be comprehensible by domain experts .
4 . THE DATASETS Our dataset consists of historical defect reports from industry software projects of an enterprise software vendor . Defect reports change over time and so there is an opportunity to learn from multiple different versions of a single defect report . Additionally , the same defect can be reported several times by different parties . Therefore , numerous data records in the dataset may belong to only one defect . Confidentiality of the data only allows us to give a brief description of the data . The data was collected in a period of 2004 , and contains a total of about 165,000 records ( defect report observations ) . Note that the class labels of this dataset have all been verified by real escalations of the software products , thus this dataset contains much less noise than the one used in our previous work [ 16 ] . The total number of attributes is 53 , most of which are numerical attributes ( including dates ) , and a few are nominal ( such as product name ) . The system uses three types of inputs : 1 ) raw inputs which correspond to field values which are reported by users and stored in the defect tracking database , 2 ) row level transformations of raw values , such as concatenating two string valued raw inputs into a derived new string valued input , and 3 ) statistical inputs which are derived from statistical a raw input
For learning . example , analyses of all rows which fall into a given time period , such as a fiscal quarter . Statistical inputs were particularly useful for string valued raw inputs because string valued data is typically difficult to use for machine for "CUSTOMER_NAME" may have 20,000 possible customer name values . Therefore , the system calculates statistics for stringvalued inputs . These statistics include counts ( number of defects submitted by customer "abc" , and number of escalations raised by customer "abc" ) , means ( number of escalations over number of defects submitted for hardware platform "xyz" ) , and the probability of an escalation , and so on . Further analysis of these inputs and their utility for prediction is of great interest but beyond the scope of this paper . The target attribute is binary ( escalation or no escalation ) . The whole dataset is split up into training and test sets according to the defect report date . The training set contains about two thirds of the records ( before a certain date ) , and the test set contains one third of the records ( after that date ) . The dataset is very imbalanced , with slightly less than 1 % of the positive examples ( escalated defects ) .
5 . COMPARING COST SENSITIVE LEARNING APPROACHES FOR EP In this section we compare the five cost sensitive learning approaches ( Undersampling , Costing , Relabeling , Weighting , and CSTree ) discussed in Section 3 on the latest dataset we have obtained . Again the latest dataset contains much less noise than the dataset used in our previous work [ 16 ] , thus the results reported here are different ( but the general conclusion is still the same ) . In addition , more base learning algorithms are included in the current study ( see later ) . Again the first four approaches are wrappers or meta costsensitive learning methods , as they apply to any cost blind base learning algorithms to make them cost sensitive . We choose four popular learning algorithms , naïve Bayes , the decision tree algorithm C4.5 [ 17 ] , decision stump [ 13 ] , and REPTree [ 21 ] as their base learners , due to their popularity and high efficiency . The fifth method ( CSTree ) is also a decision tree but it is costsensitive in nature . It would be interesting to compare various wrapper methods applying to cost blind C4.5 to the cost sensitive decision tree ( CSTree ) . To make the net profit result comparable with different approaches , we use “ unit ” net profit , defined as the net profit divided by the number of records in the test sets in our comparison . Note that even if a data mining method obtains a unit net profit of $1 , the saving to the enterprise software vendors can be quite significant . If we assume that 1 unit represents $50 in reality ( a reasonable figure ) , then with 1,000 software defect reports in a software product to be released , a total saving with EP ’s prediction would be 1,000×50 = $50,000 for a typical customer . Alternatively , assuming a unit cost of $250 and 50,000 defect reports the total savings amount to $12.5 million . Bagging is applied to all methods . The maximum unit net profit , when the bagging iteration is set to 1 ( no bagging ) , 10 , and 100 are shown in Table 3 .

From the results in the table , we can draw several interesting conclusions . First , in terms of performance of the five different cost sensitive learning algorithms , we can see that they perform quite differently , even when they use the same base learning algorithms . This means that some trial and error is needed to choose the best performing cost sensitive approach in EP ( and other real world applications ) . For meta learning approaches ( the first four approaches ) , different base learners also yield very different performance . In general , C4.5 and REPTree perform better than other base learning algorithms . The fifth method , CSTree , is the best . Decision tree models ( such as C4.5 and REPTree ) with no bagging ( bagging iteration is 1 ) also produce comprehensible results that can provide insights to the software vendors as to why certain defects are highly likely to escalate . Second , compared to no bagging ( bagging iteration is 1 ) , bagging ( with 10 or 100 iterations ) generally improves the result when the maximum unit net profit is positive . However , CSTree achieves an excellent result without bagging ( with the highest unit net profit of 1472 ) Again without the need of bagging , a single tree has the advantage of producing comprehensible results for domain experts to exam the outcome of data mining . Third , sometimes cost sensitive methods produce very negative in terms of unit net profit , such as Costing , Relabeling , and Weighting with naïve Bayes . As we discussed in Section 2 , often these absolute values of the unit net profit is important for software enterprise vendors to decide if the deployment of data mining is profitable or not , and by how much , compared to the default strategy . Negative net profit , even though it is a maximal value , indicates that it is not worthwhile to deploy the data mining effort . Fortunately in our case , we have found clear winners : the CSTree , Costing , and Weighting , as they have resulted in large positive unit net profit . Deployment of EP with CSTree is encouraging . See Section 6 for details . To summarize , of all algorithms tested , CSTree performs best for the EP task . In Table 4 , we rank the five algorithms according to their highest unit net profit , and the average unit net profit ( averaging over the four base learners for the meta cost sensitive learning methods ) . Both rankings indicate that CSTree performs the best , followed by Costing or Weighting , and followed by Undersampling or Relabeling .

Clearly CSTree without bagging is the most appropriate choice for deployment in the software development cycle , due to its superior performance and comprehensibility . We will discuss the deployment of EP in the next section .
6 . DEPLOYMENT Our EP system has been in deployment for many months in the product group of an enterprise software vendor where the dataset comes from . It has been used to make suggestions on current defect reports with high risks of escalation . As the software vendor must wait to see which defect reports are actually escalated after the product is released , and the would be escalations will not happen after they are accurately predicted by EP and corrected before software release , the final evaluation cannot be obtained until the software has been released and has been in use by customers for some period of time ( in the order of one or more quarters ) . We have evaluated EP using the defect reports submitted or updated during the most recent three weeks in the test set . Any records corresponding to defect reports which had already been escalated at the time of preparing the data set were also removed . After EP makes its predictions , the results are compared to the actual escalations happened up to date . The EP prediction performance is quite good . The lift chart of EP ’s prediction is well above the random diagonal line : at top 10 percentile ( among top 10 % of the most likely predicted escalations ) , about 70 % of the actual escalations are predicted ; at 20 percentile about 85 % ; and at 30 percentile about 90 % . These results are of significant business value to the software vendor . In addition , the product group has provided positive feedback on the performance of the EP system , citing that it “ catches ” defect reports that , after thorough evaluation by specialist , are considered likely candidates for future escalations . For instance , some defect reports have been found to have been assigned a lower than appropriate priority . After a prediction of high escalation risk becomes available such a defect report can be upgraded to a higher priority which will lead to expedited evaluation and resolution .
7 . CONCLUSIONS Enterprise software development is an extremely complex process with hundreds or even thousands of defects that need to be prioritized and resolved , preventing them from escalation by customers and incurring a very high cost to the software vendors . In this paper , we present a successful case for predicting escalation risks mined from known product defect reports . The enterprise software vendors can proactively resolve these defects with the greatest risk of escalation at a much lower cost . This can save software vendors an enormous amount of software maintenance cost . An escalation prediction ( EP ) system based on data mining for the maximum net profit has been proposed and tested , and is currently deployed at an enterprise software vendor . Results provide strong evidence that we can indeed make useful predictions about the escalation risk of product defects . More specifically , we establish a general framework in which the maximum net profit problem can be converted to cost sensitive learning . We then evaluate and compare five major cost sensitive learning methods for their effectiveness for EP . We find that the CSTree ( with novel improvements ) can produce large positive unit net profit , as well as comprehensible results . This is often important for deploying data mining solutions in industry . In our future work , we plan to continue to improve the effectiveness of the EP system and track its results from the software vendors .
