ABSTRACT We analyze the social network emerging from the user comment activity on the website Slashdot . The network presents common features of traditional social networks such as a giant component , small average path length and high clustering , but differs from them showing moderate reciprocity and neutral assortativity by degree . Using Kolmogorov Smirnov statistical tests , we show that the degree distributions are better explained by log normal instead of power law distributions . We also study the structure of discussion threads using an intuitive radial tree representation . Threads show strong heterogeneity and self similarity throughout the different nesting levels of a conversation . We use these results to propose a simple measure to evaluate the degree of controversy provoked by a post .

INTRODUCTION
Message boards or web forums are online areas where discussions are held by many users on a variety of topics . Some users post articles and other users can comment on these posts , forming a discussion thread or nested dialogue . Although the first message boards , USENET and the bulletin board system ( BBS ) , date back to 1979 only recently the social networks emerging from the comment interaction between their users have been studied [ 24 , 14 , 8 ] .
In addition to this form of networks , message boards can show rich complexity in the structure of their discussion threads . Unlike personal weblogs which receive a few number of replies [ 15 ] , message board blogs can receive thousands of messages during a day . Previous studies of USENET

ACM 978 1 60558 085 2/08/04 . have been focused mainly on visualization techniques to facilitate understanding of the social and semantic structure [ 20 ] . The Netscan system [ 22 ] , a powerful interface to track discussion threads and authors , has proven to be a valuable tool to understand different roles appearing in these newsgroups [ 6 , 4 ] . It is therefore of interest to analyze the statistics governing the structure of threads in order to understand the underlying patterns of communication existing in these large online spaces , and to develop efficient techniques which improve the system performance .
Here we have selected Slashdot1 , a popular technologynews website created in 1997 that publishes frequently short news posts and allows its readers to comment on them . Unlike other message boards , Slashdot has a community based moderation system that awards a score between −1 and +5 to every comment and upholds the quality of discussions by discouraging Spam and offensive comments [ 13 ] . Threads in Slashdot may trail for two weeks and one single post can easily exceed 200 contributions , which are mainly replies to other comments rather than direct responses to the original posts . These implicit relationships based on shared interests can be used to construct a network [ 24 , 8 ] amenable to study typical macroscopic quantities of complex networks [ 18 ] .
In previous studies [ 11 , 12 ] the temporal patterns of the time differences between a post and its comments have been analyzed and notable regularities were found . Here we use the same dataset as in these studies , which represents one year of activity on Slashdot and consists of about 104 news posts which received 2 , 075 , 085 comments written by 93 , 636 users ( see [ 12 ] for more details concerning the dataset ) .
We also characterize the discussion threads by studying several quantities associated to their radial tree structure . They show strong heterogeneity and self similarity throughout the different nesting levels of a conversation . Based on these results , we propose a simple measure to evaluate the degree of controversy provoked by a post .
2 . THE SOCIAL NETWORK
We first explain the procedure used to create three different versions of the network . Next , the values obtained for different indicators are analyzed with special emphasis on the degree distribution . Finally , we describe briefly the community structure .
2.1 Building the Network
We generate a social network based on the implicit relations between the author of a comment and the user who 1http://wwwslashdotorg

Table 1 : Comments discarded after proper filtering . replies to it . To improve the quality and the representativity of the resulting graph , we filter some of the comments according to the following four criteria :
1 . The post : Under this assumption , no relations exist between the post ’s author and its direct commentators , unless he also participates later in the discussion .
2 . Anonymous comments were also discarded .
3 . We discard very low quality comments with score −1 . 4 . Finally , we filter out self replies , often motivated by a forgotten aspect or error fix of the original comment .
The second and third column of Table 1 show the total number and the percentage of comments which fall in each category . Columns 4 and 5 give number and percentage of comments discarded due to the above explained filter steps . Note that after elimination of direct replies to posts and anonymous comments , low score comments only represent a small fraction .
After the filtering process , the remaining number of comments is 1 , 281 , 888 , approximately 63 % of the total . The users are reduced to 80 , 962 , approximately 87 % of the initial set of users .
In a social network , each user corresponds a node i ∈ V in a graph G = hV , Ei . Edges in our graph ( i , j ) ∈ E indicate social relations between two individuals , which are consequence of their comment activity . Let nij be the number of times that user i writes a comment to user j . Based on nij , there are several ways to interpret when two users are linked . To be as much systematic as possible , we compare three different types of networks according to the following interpretations :
Undirected dense : An undirected edge exists between users i and j if either nij > 0 or nji > 0 . The weight of that edge wij is simply the sum nij + nji .
Undirected sparse : An undirected edge exists between users i and j if nij > 0 and nji > 0 . The weight of an edge wij in this case is defined as wij = min{nij , nji} . Directed : A directed edge exists from user i to user j if nij > 0 regardless of nji . The weight wij = nij .
Figure 1 shows a small example to illustrate the generation of the three different graphs . On the left , there is a tree structure corresponding to a small thread of depth 4 . Labels denote the user who writes the contribution and valid comments are shown within the gray region . The post triggers four responses from users A , B , C and D . At the second nesting level , five comments appear ( two from the same user E , one from user A ( who already commented on the original post ) , and two more from users F and G . At the third level , there are only two comments from users A and C , and finally , there is one last comment from G .
The small graphs on the right correspond to the three In Figure 1b , users are linked if they exgraph versions . In Figure 1c , bidirectional change at least one message . edges exists between users when both users replied a comment of the other . These reciprocal relations are the links in the undirected sparse graph . Note that we do not consider possible relations not associated to the thread structure like mentioning a user within the text of a comment . Semantic analysis would be required to overcome this limitation .
2.2 General Description
We now characterize the structural properties of the obtained graphs [ 18 ] . Table 2 shows the values of the indicators considered here for the different networks . If not stated otherwise , indicators are calculated for the unweighted graph . In the first two rows we show the number of nodes N = |V | and edges M = |E| of the respective networks . In the case of the undirected sparse graph , N is reduced significantly . The number of actual links M is very small compared to the potential number of relationships O(N 2 ) . This would suggest a highly sparse network with many connected components composed of small groups of users . However , as row 3 of Table 2 indicates , a vast majority of the population forms a “ giant component ” , leaving only a small proportion of users disconnected from that component . These isolated users are grouped mainly in pairs , or at most , in small clusters of size 4 in all three networks . In both undirected graphs , the “ giant component ” contains more than 97 % of the users and in the directed2 network almost 75 % . These quantities indicate that the social network of Slashdot is characterized by a compact community and a small proportion of isolated users , in concordance with typical social networks .
The average degree hki is shown in row 4 of Table 2 ( standard deviations between parenthesis ) . The directed network presents an intermediate value between the dense and sparse undirected representations . All cases show high standard deviations , indicating a big level of heterogeneity within the community . This aspect is analyzed in more detail in Section 23
The average path length ℓ , measured only for the giant component , takes small values for all three networks , sug
2We consider weakly connected components in the directed case , ie two vertices i and j belong to the same component if there exists a path between i and j at least in one of the two possible directions . The size of the big cluster for strongly connected components is of course , smaller .

Table 2 : Indicators of the Slashdot social networks . gesting that the small world property is present in all of them . The quantities are approximately one unit lower than the corresponding value for a random graph ℓrand . The maximal distance D between two users is also very small . Even for the undirected sparse case , it only takes a maximum of eleven steps to reach a user starting randomly from any other . These results are also in accordance with similar studies of other traditional social networks .
To study the statistical level of cohesiveness we calculate the clustering coefficient C according to [ 23 ] , and also its weighted version C w [ 1 ] . We notice no significant differences between them . Thus the number of messages interchanged between two users is not relevant to determine the clustering level . The impact of having a weighted network is analyzed in more detail in Section 25 We can see that for all graphs , C and C w are about two orders of magnitude higher than their randomized counterpart Crand . This is again in harmony with other analysis of real world networks , which report similar deviations from the random graph , and enhances the evidence of the small world property . As before , the directed graph represents an intermediate value between both undirected versions .
Another quantity of special interest in social networks is the degree correlation , or mixing coefficient , which allows to detect whether highly connected users are preferentially linked to other highly connected ones or not . This fact is known as assortative mixing by degree and is present in many social networks [ 19 ] . Table 2 shows the correlation coefficient r for our three networks , which is far from ±1 . Therefore , unlike traditional social networks which present a strong assortative mixing , Slashdot is characterized by neither assortative nor dissortative mixing . Users do not show any preference to write comments in function of the connectivity of the other users . Interestingly , other related studies of online communities show similar [ 10 , 8 ] coefficients . This seems to be a fundamental difference to social interactions occurring outside these large online spaces .
The last general property we analyze is the reciprocity . High reciprocity is another feature typically present in social networks . In our case , reciprocity occurs when a user i replies the answer of another user j to a previous comment of i , and can be measured by means of a reciprocity coefficient ρ . Using the method proposed in [ 7 ] , we quantify how the Slashdot network differs from a random network in the presence of two mutual links ( edges in both directions ) between pairs of nodes . The small positive value ρ = 0.28 suggests that our network is only moderately reciprocal , so that users tend to write slightly more often than expected by chance to other users who previously wrote them .
From this global characterization we can conclude that the underlying network of Slashdot presents common features of traditional social networks , namely , a giant cluster of connected users , small average path length and high clustering . In contrast to other social networks , Slashdot shows moderate reciprocity and neutral assortativity by degree . We also see that there is significant difference between considering dense and sparse undirected versions , and that the directed version represents an intermediate description between the two . The moderate value of the reciprocity coefficient ρ suggests that studying only the undirected network , one could miss some relevant structural information . Finally , regarding clustering , we see no significant differences between the weighted and the binary network . Despite the strong similarity to a much smaller network of BBS users [ 8 ] , these two features seem to be exclusive of Slashdot .
2.3 Degree Distributions
We now focus on the function describing the number of users in the network with a given number of neighbors . The analysis of this degree distribution describes the level of interaction between users and provides a robust indicator about the grade of heterogeneity in the network .
Figure 2 shows in small circles the probability distribution ( pdf ) and the cumulative distribution ( cdf ) of the degrees for the directed network . The other two networks present equivalent results . First , we can see that in and out degree distributions are almost identical . Unlike previous studies [ 8 ] , in our case the activities of writing and being replied could be characterized by similar processes .
As expected , the obtained distributions are heavy tailed , covering in this case more than three orders of magnitude and indicating a high level of heterogeneity between the users . Surprisingly , the users located at the tail of the distri

647WWW 2008 / Refereed Track : Social Networks & Web 2.0 Analysis of Social Networks & Online Interaction bution are not Slashdot authors of posts who also participate actively in the discussions , as one would expect . The first Slashdot author in the list sorted by degree appears at position number 378 ( in the case of the in degree distribution of the directed network ) . Therefore , the hubs of the social network are not the “ affiliated ” authors , but regular users who participate actively in the discussions .
To find a functional form which best explains the observed data , we compare two approximations : the “ usually assumed ” power law ( PL ) hypothesis , and a truncated lognormal ( LN ) hypothesis [ 16 ] . Their corresponding density functions are given by fLN ( x ; µ , σ , θ ) =

( x − θ)σ√2π exp„−(ln(x − θ ) − µ)2

« and fP L(x ; α , xmin ) = x−α
ζ(α , xmin )
, where ζ(α , x ) = P∞ n=0(n + x)−α is the generalized or Hurwitz zeta function . We select the optimal parameter values using maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) . The PL distribution has as parameters the scaling exponent α and the minimum degree value xmin from which the PL behavior occurs . To find the proper value of xmin we apply a recent method proposed in [ 5 ] . The LN distribution has three parameters : the mean µ , the standard deviation σ and a shift θ , which represents a lower bound of the degree values . Both distributions can be very similar [ 16 ] .
Figure 2 shows that for the case of the PL hypothesis ( dashed bold line ) , the obtained values of xmin ( represented by the border between gray and white areas ) are extremely large , leaving almost all the data samples outside the fitted region , which contains only a few users at the tail of the distribution . However , the LN fit provides an explanation of the entire dataset , of both , the left support of the distribution , where most of the probability mass is concentrated , and also in the tail of the distribution , where fluctuations are bigger due to finite sampling effects .
Table 3 summarizes the results of the fits of the degree distributions . The first two columns of the upper part of Table 3 show the parameters of the PL distribution . The minimum value of xmin is 5 , corresponding to the undirected sparse version . Even in this case , more than 75 % of the users are not included in the PL fit . The proportion of discarded samples is indicated in the third column . The lower part of Table 3 gives the parameters of the LN approximation , which show more variability than those of the PL .

After selecting the optimal values of the parameters for both hypothesis , we test whether the provided model of the data can be accepted or not . We use the KolmogorovSmirnov test ( KS ) , whose p values are shown in the last column of Table 3 . In all cases , the PL hypothesis provides a p value much lower than 0.1 ( our choice of the significance level of the KS test ) . Hence , we can conclude that , even after discarding most of the data , the PL is not able to explain the tail of the distributions . In contrast , the obtained p values for the truncated LN model are quite high , all of them bigger than 0.1 , so the LN hypothesis allows to explain the entire distribution .
2.4 Mixing by Score
In Section 2.2 we have seen that the Slashdot network presents neutral mixing by degree . It is interesting to analyze whether Slashdot users show assortative mixing by other attributes . In this subsection , we associate to each user a score , which is calculated by averaging over all the scores of the comments of the same user . This quantity allows us to differentiate high quality writers ( those with high mean score ) from regular quality writers .
The initial score of a comment is generally 1 if it comes from a registered user or 0 if it is anonymous3 . Moderation can modify the initial score to any integer within the range [ −1 , 5 ] . To ensure a representative subset of the network , we only consider users who wrote at least 10 comments , a total of 18 , 476 users , representing approximately 23 % .
In Figure 3a we plot the histogram and the corresponding cdf of the distribution of the mean scores . Note that the minimum score is 0 , since we eliminate −1 comments . The distribution shows an unexpected bimodal profile , with two peaks at mean scores 1.1 and 23 This indicates that two different classes of users coexist .
Is the mean score a representative measure of the user ’s commenting quality ? To check its validity we plot in Figure 3b the distribution of the standard deviations of the scores . More than 3/4 of all users show deviations smaller than 1 , so the scores a user obtains do not fluctuate significantly . Therefore , their mean seems to be a good candidate to characterize the user . 3Anonymous users cannot be considered in this analysis .

648WWW 2008 / Refereed Track : Social Networks & Web 2.0 Analysis of Social Networks & Online Interaction We now analyze whether users of one class reply preferentially to users of the same class or not . The bimodality suggests a simple characterization using two classes of users . We select the boundary between classes to balance their sizes ( the resulting boundary is 190 ) Thus a given user is assigned to class c1 if its mean score is ≤ 1.90 , and otherwise to class c2 . Class c1 contains 9 , 254 users whereas c2 contains 9 , 222 . The assortativity matrix E is calculated counting the number of comments interchanged between classes . Each element Eij indicates the number of comments that users of class i wrote to users of class j . Its normalized version E′ is obtained dividing E by the total number of comments :
E = „ 78,341 198,391
151,013 455,997 « E′ = „ 0.09 0.22
0.17 0.52 « .
The assortativity coefficient is rscore = 0.036 , so the network is neutrally mixed by mean score . Note , however , that more than half of the comments are written from users of class c2 to other c2 users , and that the proportion of comments received by c2 users is 0.74 , so there is a strong bias in favour of good writers .
This can either mean that users tend to reply preferentially to users of the class with higher average score , or simply that high scored comments tend to receive more reactions than low scored ones independently of the user . To check this , we compare in Figure 3c the average number of replies received by comments in function of their scores for either all users or only the users of classes c1 and c2 . To get a broader range of scores , we also include negative scores . It is quite clear that scores ≥ 2 correlate with the average number of reactions and are independent of the user ’s class , but comments with scores below 2 do not show this correlation and achieve substantially more replies on average if written by users of class c2 .
We can thus conclude that on average , although higher scored comments tend to achieve more replies regardless of the user who wrote it , it is also true that good writers , even when they post low scored comments , still receive significant more replies than c1 users .
2.5 Community Structure
To end this characterization of the Slashdot network we analyze its community structure . We take a simple approach based on agglomerative clustering which takes benefit from the weighted nature of the Slashdot network [ 18 ] . We choose the dense undirected network and start our procedure with each node as an independent cluster . Let λ denote the number of comments , so that pairs of users ( i , j ) who interchange a number of comments wij ≥ λ are included in the network , and the other connections are discarded . Starting from the biggest value λ = λmax and progressively decreasing it , users are connected incrementally and communities can be obtained . This simple procedure is equivalent to building a dendrogram and allows to browse through the community structure at different scales by changing the parameter λ .
Figure 4a shows the distribution of the weights wij of all links in the network . The vast majority of pairs of users only exchanges a small number of comments whereas a few of them really maintain intense dialogues during the year . This seems to be the reason why previous properties such as the clustering coefficient do not show significant differences between the weighted and the unweighted network . The most discussing pair of users exchanged a total of 108

( b ) Number of clusters in function of λ and ( c ) considering only clusters of size > 1 . ( D ) Size of the two biggest clusters . comments . This represents our initial value λmax to start the agglomerative procedure .
Since most of users exchange only a small amount of comments , one would expect that the number of clusters remains quite high for a wide range of λ values . This is indeed the case . As λ is progressively decreased , users are being grouped in small clusters . Simultaneously , a giant cluster is being formed which absorbs the small clusters when they reach a moderate size . In Figure 4b we plot the number of clusters in function of λ . It is reduced dramatically in the last step when λ = 1 is reached . A more detailed analysis can be obtained if we discard isolated users , and focus only on groups of pairs or more users , who at least interchanged one comment . This is shown in Figure 4c . We can see that for high values of λ , the number of groups of size two or more is very small . Then it starts to grow significantly around λ ∼ 10 , reaches a maximum at λ = 3 , and then again falls to the number of components of the original graph ( considering all links ) . We also plot in Figure 4d the sizes of the two biggest components in function of λ . We can see that the biggest component grows very fast and the second biggest remains small , showing evidence of a giant cluster present in all scales .
We can track the resulting communities and show the networks at each λ . This is roughly illustrated in Figure 5 , where two snapshots of the agglomerative process are shown . Figure 5 ( top ) corresponds to a high value of λ = 20 , where a small backbone of the most connected users is starting to grow . Note that users are colored according to their score attribute ( see Section 24 ) Users corresponding to the second class ( high quality commentators ) are colored in red . Clearly , the backbone of Slashdot users is formed mainly by high quality commentators . For λ = 15 ( Figure 5 bottom ) , the most connected users receive even more connections and form the giant component . A few clusters of small sizes which still do not have grown sufficiently to be merged with the big community are also present .

3 . STRUCTURE OF THE DISCUSSIONS
After analyzing the social network of Slashdot , we focus on the question about how information is structured within a discussion thread . A thread starts with the publication of a post , which in turn triggers an amount of activity in the form of comments . In this section , we present a statistical characterization of the structure of such discussions using a useful and intuitive radial tree representation . This representation leads naturally to a measure which can be useful to evaluate the degree of controversy of a given post .
An initial picture of the activity generated by posts can be found in previous studies [ 12 ] . Posts receive on average approximately 195 comments and there exists a clear scale in the number of comments a post can originate . Half of them receive less than 160 contributions . A small number of highly discussed ones , however , can trigger more than one thousand contributions .
The number of comments gives an idea of how the participation is distributed among the different articles , but is not enough to quantify the degree of interaction . For instance , a post may incite many readers to comment , but if the author of a comment does not reply the responses to his comment , there is no reciprocal communication within the thread . In this case , although users can participate significantly , we can hardly interpret that the post has been highly discussed . On the other hand , a post with a small number of contributors but with one long dialogue chain will evidence a high degree of reciprocal interaction ( albeit its general interest may be reduced ) . At the description level of the social network , the reciprocity coefficient ρ and the agglomerative clustering described in the previous section already represent a measure to explain the degree of ( reciprocal ) interaction . At the description level of the individual post , a possible measure to quantify this type of interaction is the maximum number of comments written by a single user to a particular post .
We show this quantity ( excluding the anonymous users ) versus the number of posts , ie how many posts exist with a certain maximum number of comments written by the same user , in Figure 6 . The obtained distribution has a peak at 4 . As the cdf indicates , for approximately half of the posts at least one single user participates 5 times or more in the discussion . The log normal shape of the distribution suggests a multiplicative process underlying the generation of this quantity . This indicates a strong heterogeneity and level of interaction within discussion threads . Users do not only give an opinion , but also interchange a significant quantity of messages , and the intensity of this interaction varies considerably throughout the different posts . We now study in more detail their intrinsic tree structure .
3.1 Radial Tree Representation
The high number of comments elicited by controversial posts makes them difficult to explore and to find relevant contributions within the nested dialogues . The current interface of Slashdot offers a filtering mechanism based on scores . By default , direct comments to a post rated 1 or higher are fully shown . For deeper nesting levels , comments can be fully shown ( score 4 or above ) , abbreviated ( score between 1 and 4 ) or hidden ( score below 1 ) .
We propose a natural representation of thread discussions which takes advantage of their structure . Consider a post as a central node . Direct replies to this post are attached in a first nesting level and subsequent comments at increasing nesting levels in a way that the whole thread can be considered as a circular structure which grows radially from a central root during its lifetime , a radial tree . Figure 7 shows three snapshots of a radial tree associated to a controversial post which attracted a lot of users . An analog example of a less discussed post can be seen in Figure 8 . More examples of trees are shown in Figure 9 . Their profiles are highly heterogeneous . In some examples , only a huge number of contributions without replies appear in the first level , resulting in trees with high widths but small depths . In other examples , however , there are only discussions between two users who comment alternatively giving rise to very deep trees with small widths . Sometimes , the intensity of the discussion is translated to one of the branches because of a controversial comment which triggers even more reactions than the original post ( e.g the post in the center of Figure 9 ) .
650WWW 2008 / Refereed Track : Social Networks & Web 2.0 Analysis of Social Networks & Online Interaction Figure 7 : An example of radial tree structure corresponding to a controversial post related to Windows and Linux which received a total of 982 comments . The title of the post is “ Can Ordinary PC Users Ditch Windows for Linux ? ” . Figures show three snapshots in different times . maximum depth of the posts . However , as Figure 10b indicates , the distribution of maximum depths does not follow the same pattern . It is almost symmetrical , weakly skewed toward smaller maximum depths . Although comments are concentrated in the first levels , threads typically reach a depth around 7 .
Up to now , the quantities analyzed do not capture the apparent heterogeneity of the discussion threads we have reported in previous examples ( see Figure 9 ) . We now take
Apart from being a useful tool for browsing and examining the contents of a highly discussed post , radial trees can be used to describe statistically how information is structured in a thread . In Figure 10a we plot the distribution of all the extracted comments per nesting level for all posts . This gives an idea about the relation between the width versus the depth of the trees . The first two levels contain most of the comments and then their number decays exponentially in function of the depth . The maximum depth was 17 . A general pattern which seems to be common to all threads is formed by a broad first nesting level of contributions , followed by a second , even wider set , and finally an exponential decay . This fact is reflected in the peak at depth two of the plot and the decreasing number of comments for deeper nesting levels . This gives evidence of the transient nature of the discussions . The reason behind this pattern is apparently related with an initial growth of interest which is reduced after users may have exposed all their knowledge , or translated to a more recent article . Only those who have engaged a dialogue will keep writing in subsequent levels . This decay could also be explained because of accessibility awkwardness , since the visibility of a comment can be proportional to its depth . The previous result would suggest that the majority of posts does not reach high nesting levels , and one would expect a similar distribution for the

( c ) Number of posts per h index . a look on how the comments are generated within a given nesting level . This analysis can be performed extracting the branching factors b , that is , the number replies provoked by a given comment ( or a given post ) . Figure 11 shows in log log scale the distributions of b for the first five nesting levels . Level 0 corresponds to direct comments to the posts , whereas subsequent plots correspond to replies to comments . First , the range of possible values spans almost three orders of magnitude for direct comments and is considerable for subsequent nesting levels , which gives evidence of the high heterogeneity underlying the discussion threads . Second , there is a clear discrepancy between commenting level 0 and subsequent ones . While the distribution of direct replies follows quite closely a bell shape in the log log domain , subsequent levels have an always decreasing probability . This illustrates the different nature of the process underlying the generation of comments to the initial post and the generation of replies to other comments . Interestingly , this variation is not reported in subsequent nesting levels . In addition , no dependency of the score on the nesting level could be found ( data not shown ) . Although the resulting threads can take very different forms as we have previously shown , the same generative process seems to be taking place at all nesting levels . The bell shaped curve of the first level branching factors , and the curvature in subsequent levels in log log scales suggest again a good LN fit to

3.2 The H index as a Structural Measure of
Controversy
In this subsection we will use the previous results to measure the degree of controversy of a post . As before , our approach does not consider semantic features and only relies on its structural information . It is important to note that a definition of controversial is necessarily subjective . However , indicators such as the number of comments received or the maximum depth of the discussions can be , among others , good candidate quantities to evaluate the controversy of a post , but suffer from some drawbacks as we will explain in what follows . We therefore seek for a measure , as simple as possible which incorporates as many of these factors and is able to rank a set of posts properly . The number of comments alone does not tell us much about the structure of the discussion . There might be a lot of comments in the first level but very little real discussions , such as in the post of Figure 12a . A better measure for the controversy of a post seems to be the maximum depth of the nesting . But again that measure has some drawbacks . Two users may become entangled in some discussion without participation of the rest of the community , increasing the depth of the thread . The example of Figure 12b illustrates this case . We thus want to overcome both types of bias .
We propose to quantify the degree of controversy associated to a post using an adapted version of the h index [ 9 ] , commonly used to characterize the scientific output of researchers . The papers of a researcher are ordered by their number of citations in descending order and the h index is then defined as the maximum rank number , for which the number of citations is greater or equal to the rank number . It represents a fair quantity which considers the number of papers published by the scientist and their visibility , or how often these papers are cited by other scientists . Some extensions of this index have been proposed as an alternative to the impact factor of journals and conferences [ 3 , 21 ] . See [ 2 ] for more details and a review on literature about the h index . For our purposes , we will define the h index in the following way : given a radial tree corresponding to a discussion thread and its comments organized in nesting levels , the hindex h of a post is then the maximum nesting level i which has at least h > i comments , or in other words , h + 1 is the
652WWW 2008 / Refereed Track : Social Networks & Web 2.0 Analysis of Social Networks & Online Interaction proposed measure uses as a first ranking criteria the h index and as second the inverse of the number of comments . For a post i we use the following formula to rank it : ri = h indexi +

The first 15 posts according to this ranking can be seen in Table 4 . We also show their ranks if only their number of comments or their maximal discussion depth would have been considered . In the latter case , we choose as well the number of comments to break the ties .

0 first nesting level i which has less than i comments . Turning back to Figure 12b , we can easily calculate the h index . There are 9 comments in both first and second levels , 6 comments in the third level and 3 comments in the fourth level , which gives an h index of 3 . This post has maximum nesting level of 17 , and it is ranked first if only the maximum depth is considered , but drops down to the position 9 , 239 using the h index . Similarly , the post of Figure 12a , which received 161 comments , has just an h index of 3 , because most of the comments are located in the upper levels . The post falls 4 , 412 positions from a ranking based only on the number of comments to its rank based on the h index .
Figure 10c shows a histogram with the number of posts with a given h index . This distribution is less skewed than those of the number of comments and the maximum depth ( compare with Figures 10a and 10b ) . In Figures 13 and 14 we plot a 3D chart to compare both , number of comments and maximum depth , against the h index .
Although we observe an evident correlation between both quantities ( more pronounced in the maximum depth ) there exist posts which receive a lot of comments but interestingly do not have a significant h index . This is even more evident when comparing h index and maximum depth .
Since many posts share the same h index , we need a way to break the ties . In this situation , we prioritize posts which reach a certain h index with less comments . Thus , our final
Our analysis represents a step toward the understanding of the structure of networks in which relations are hidden and more generic than explicit , well defined links such as friendships or affiliations . The Slashdot network exhibits some special features that deviate from traditional social networks : neutral mixing by degree , almost identical in and out degree distributions , only moderated reciprocity , and absence of a complex community structure . We conjecture that most of the reactions in Slashdot arise when high diversity in opinions occur . Users are therefore more inclined to be linked to people who express different points of view [ 17 ] . The nature of this interaction seems to be a key aspect to understand the obtained results .
Unlike the BBS network [ 24 , 8 ] where discussions are unrestricted , the scoring system of Slashdot guarantees a high quality and representativity of the social interaction . This particular feature allowed us to find a correlation between scores and number of received replies and to distinguish clearly between two classes of users : good writers who , on average achieve high scores for their comments , and regular writers . The number of replies of a comment depends mostly on its quality ( the score it achieved ) but we find some weak evidence for user reputation influencing the connectivity in the network . Good writers are more likely than regular ones to receive replies to occasional comments with low scores . However , this effect is not strong enough to cause assortative mixing by score since the opposite is not true . Regular writers can expect a similar number of replies as good writers to their comments with high scores , so there is no negative effect of a user ’s reputation .
When analyzing the tree structure generated by the nesting of comments , we find interesting properties such as selfsimilarity within the different nesting levels of a discussion . This suggests that , despite the strong heterogeneity in the shapes of the discussions visible in their radial tree representation , a simple depth invariant mechanism exists which is responsible for their evolution . A detailed study of the dynamics governing the growth of nested discussions is a topic of ongoing research .
To measure the degree of controversy of a discussion , a recent approach [ 15 ] trains a classifier using features that combine semantic and structural information . Our proposed measure , based on the h index , appears to be a more convenient indicator because of its simplicity , objectivity and robustness . It can be calculated efficiently and is monotonic ( it never decreases ) , which makes it also a stable quantity to monitor and rank a discussion thread while it is still alive and receiving contributions . However , human based visual validation is necessary to check how it correlates with subjective sensation of controversy .
