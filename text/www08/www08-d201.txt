1 . INTRODUCTION The WWW now is widely used as an information exchange platform . However semantic interoperability in the WWW is still limited due to information heterogeneity problem . Ontology as a shared understanding of a domain has been suggested as a solution . With the popularity of ontologies , ontology mapping , finding semantic correspondences between similar elements of different ontologies , has attracted many researchers' attention . A comprehensive survey of ontology mapping can be found in [ 3 ] . The characteristics of an ontology and its representation result in many kinds of constraints . For example , the hierarchical relations in RDFS [ 7 ] do not allow crisscross mappings , the axioms such as owl:sameAs and owl:equvalentClass in OWL [ 8 ] indicate an equivalent relation between different elements , and the rules in SWRL [ 9 ] would imply or assert some properties that are not directly available , etc . Therefore , how to find a global optimal configuration that best satisfies ontology constraints is intriguing . Currently most ontology mapping approaches simply validate constraints using isolate heuristic rules . Others include the similarity flooding ( SF ) [ 6 ] utilizes graph theory to verify different constraints and the GLUE [ 1 ] adopts relaxation labeling technique to optimize its mapping configuration . However SF can not deal with competitive constraints and GLUE needs the probability of distribution as their prior knowledge . In this paper we propose using the interactive activation and

Experimental result of our approach on OAEI benchmark tests is promising . It significantly boosts the performance of our preliminary results .
2 . THE APPROACH Before the discussion of the IAC neural network based constraint satisfaction approach , we briefly introduce how we generate the preliminary mapping results : First we measure three similarities of ontologies ( ie edit distance based similarity , profile similarity and structure similarity ) . Then , we adaptively aggregate different similarities according to their harmonies , ie , a measure that correlates to the reliability of the similarity . Finally based on the aggregated harmony of a mapping task , we selectively activate the IAC neural network to search for an optimal configuration that best satisfy ontology constraints . This paper focuses on the integration of the IAC neural network only . Detailed information about similarity generation and adaptive aggregation is in [ 4 ] . 2.1 The IAC Neural Network Usually an IAC neural network consists of a number of competitive nodes connected to each other . Each node represents a hypothesis . The connection between two nodes represents constraint between their hypotheses . If two hypotheses support each other , the connection between them is positive ( ie , activation ) ; whereas if two hypotheses are against each other , the connection between them is negative ( ie , competition ) . Each connection is associated with a weight , which is proportional to the strength of the constraint . The activation of a node is determined by four sources : its initial activation , the input from its adjacent nodes , its bias and external input . The comprehensive introduction of the IAC neural network can be found in [ 5 ] . The common properties between the characteristic of ontology mapping and the mechanism of the IAC network motivate the work addressed in the paper . First , the constraints in ontology mapping are either interactive or competitive between mapping hypotheses . For example , for two mapping hypotheses , ie , e1i maps to e2j and e'1i maps to e'2j , where exy is an element in ontology Ox , the constraint "if e1i maps to e2j is true , then e'1i maps to e'2j is true , where e'1i and e'2j are children of e1i , and e2j respectively" is interactive ; whereas the constraint " if e1i maps to e2j is true , then e'1i maps to e'2j is false , where e'1i is the parent of e1i , and e'2j is the children of e2j" is competitive . Second , our preliminary mapping results estimate both linguistic and structure information of ontologies . Those information bring prior knowledge , ie , the confidence of some mapping hypotheses , which is suitable to integrate into the IAC network as external inputs or bias of a node . 2.2 Its Implementation in Ontology Mapping Figure 1 illustrates the implementation of IAC neural network in the context of ontology mapping . In the picture , a node ( e1i , e2j )

Figure 1 . The IAC neural network in the context of ontology mapping represents a hypothesis that indicates a mapping between e1i and e2j . The connections between nodes represent constraints between hypotheses . For example , the constraint that "only 1 to 1 mapping is allowed" results in a negative connection between nodes ( e1i , e2j ) and ( e1i , e2k ) , where k ≠ j . Moreover , "two elements match if their children match" , results in a positive connection between nodes ( e1i , e2j ) and ( e1k , e2t ) , where e1k and e2t are the children of e1i and e2j respectively . Currently we implemented 12 constraints . The detail of each constraint is emitted due to the space limit . The weights in weight matrix correspond to the prior probability or confidence of the constraint , which are currently set as 1 for positive constraints and 1 for negative constraints . The initial activation of each node is set to the aggregated similarity of ( e1i , e2j ) from previous processes . The bias of each node is set as 0 . The external input is set to the reliability of each hypothesis . Currently the external input of unambiguous hypotheses is set as 10 , otherwise as 0 . The activation of a node can be updated with the rule illustrated in the picture , where ai denotes the activation of node i , written as ni , neti denotes the net input of the node . Finally the network is stopped when its global goodness [ 5 ] is reached to some satisfaction .
3 . EVALUATION To evaluate our approach , we adopt OAEI benchmark tests [ 2 ] , which include 1 reference ontology , dedicated to the very narrow domain of bibliography , and 50 test ontologies , 4 of them are real cases and others are handmade by discarding various information from the reference ontology . We follow OAEI evaluation criteria , calculating the precision , recall and f measure of classes and properties over each test . The experiment methodology is : Given the preliminary mapping results , we first estimate the harmony of the aggregated similarity on each benchmark test . Then we selectively activate the IAC neural network when the harmony is less than a tentatively set number , eg 06 Currently the network is activated on 20 tests , ie , 202 , 209 210 , 248 266 , 302 and 303 . Finally we extract mapping results using naïve descendant extraction algorithm [ 2 ] . Experiment results in Figure 2 and Table 1 show the NN based approach improves the f measure of 16 tests among 20 tests , especially as large as .37 on #254 . The overall improvement of the approach on all 20 tests is 13 % , 24 % , and 19 % for precision , recall , and f measure respectively . 4 . Conclusions and Future Work In this paper we proposed an IAC neural network based approach to find a global optimal solution that best satisfies ontology constraints . The experimental results show the approach dramatically improves the performance of preliminary mapping results on some tests . Future work may include exploring more complex constraints , optimizing weight matrix , implementing NN in parallel computing platforms to improve its efficiency etc .
