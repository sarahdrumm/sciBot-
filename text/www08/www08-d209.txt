ABSTRACT The shape of the Web in terms of its graphical structure has been a widely interested topic . Two graphs , Bow Tie and Daisy , have stood out from previous research . In this work , we take a different approach , by viewing the Web as a hierarchy of three levels , namely page level , host level , and domain level . Such structures are analyzed and compared with a snapshot of Chinese Web in early 2006 , involving 830 million pages , 17 million hosts , and 0.8 million domains . Some interesting results have emerged . For example , the Chinese Web appears more like a teapot ( with a large size of SCC , a medium size of IN and a small size of OUT ) at page level than the classic bow tie or daisy shape . Some challenging phenomena are also observed . For example , the INs become much smaller than OUTs at host and domain levels . Future work will tackle these puzzles .

1 . INTRODUCTION How does the World Wide Web look like as a graph ? The question is not only important for information scientists in networking traffic , search engine optimization , and other areas of information technology but also interesting for social scientists who are concerned about the diffusion , use , and impact of the technology . The pioneering work by Broder et al . [ 1 ] suggests that the Web looks like a Bow Tie of four distinct components , each in a roughly equal size , including a strongly connected component ( SCC , which accounts for 29 % of the total web pages ) , an IN component ( 24% ) , an OUT component ( 24% ) , and a disconnected component ( DISC and tendrils , 24% ) . While highly heuristic , the Bow Tie model has been considered an oversimplified representation of the complex Web structure . A major revision is the Daisy Graph proposed by Donato et al . [ 2 ] , in which the IN and OUT components are described as a large number of “ small and shallow petals ” hanging from a

Donato et al . analyzed separately a global Web ( based on data from Alta Vista and WebBase ) and three national Webs ( including Italy , UK and five Indochina countries1 ) . Sharp differences between the two types of Web were found . The global Web largely resembles Bow Tie . However , the three national Webs all show only two components : a dominant SCC ( 51 72 % ) and a visible OUT ( 2846 % ) ( columns 1 3 of Table 1 ) . In short , national Webs appear to be more connected ( with a larger SCC ) and polarized ( with two competing components ) at the same time . Liu et al . found a more dominant SCC ( 80 % ) in 140M web pages from China in 2003 [ 3 ] . However , the OUT ( 7 % ) was nearly negligible in the graph . In this paper , we report an empirical test of the Daisy Graph , against the backdrop of Bow Tie , based on a larger scale set of more recent web pages from China . Our aim is twofold : to replicate the Daisy Graph with a much larger national Web and to explore the hierarchical structure of the national Web . Donato et al . found no evidence for self similarity between global and national Webs [ 2 ] . We move one step further by examining whether there is a self similarity across different layers within a national Web .
2 . THE EXPERIMENT METHOD 2.1 Crawl of Web Pages We crawled over 830M web pages from all web sites within China , as identified by the IP addresses assigned to the country , between January and February 2006 . This number is close to the official estimate ( 947M ) of Chinese web pages at that time . 2.2 Hierarchical Structure We consider the Web a hierarchical system in which web pages are the bottom layer , which is operationally defined by a complete URL , such as http://netpkueducn/~xzm/indexhtml Host is considered the second layer , which is defined as the collection of web pages hosted on a web server . More precisely , a host corresponds to all the pages under the address of http:/// ( ie , the part between "http://" and the first "/" from the left ) . We then regard institutional web sites or domains to be the third layer . Intuitively , a domain corresponds to a registered URL from a national authority ( eg , CNNIC ) , for instance , http://pkueducn , http://sina.com , and http://infomall.cn , etc . In practice , we maintain two sets of higher level "familiar domain names" . To form a domain URL from a host URL , the program scans the

If we wish to go further , we may say national Webs as the fourth layer , 2 and the global WWW as the top layer . In an analogue , individual pages are bricks , hosts buildings , domains street blocks , and national Webs cities of the global kingdom of WWW . It is both necessary and informative to examine the structure of each layer of the Web . In the current study , we confine to the three layers ranging from pages to domains .
3 . RESULTS 3.1 Teapot Graph Of the 837M pages crawled , 43 billion links are found , which amounts to 52 links per page , or almost twice as much as found in Italy ( 28 links/page ) and Indochina ( 27 links/page ) or 3 times as much as in UK ( 16 links/page ) . However , as shown below , the larger number of links per page in the Chinese Web does not necessarily result in a denser graph , though . the host level and 63 % at the domain level ) . The finding differs again from Liu et al . [ 3 ] , in which the SCC became , surprisingly , smaller ( from 80 % to 67 % ) when aggregated from pages to hosts . What cannot be predicted in advance is how the three other components realign after the aggregation . Interestingly , it turns out that the OUT component becomes a “ winner ” as it takes almost all the remaining share ( 47 % at the host level and 35 % at the domain level ) , which is similar to Liu et al . ( from 7 % to 30 % ) [ 3 ] . Nevertheless , it is necessary to note that what has changed here is the relative proportion , not the absolute size , of OUT . In fact , the absolute size of OUT has reduced as well in the aggregation ( from 213M pages to 8M hosts and 277K domains ) .

As shown in Table 1 ( column 4 ) , the overall graph of Chinese Web departs significantly from the Bow Tie shape because the SCC accounts for a much larger share ( 44 % ) and the OUT a smaller share ( 15 % ) than the counterparts in Bow Tie . On the other hand , the Chinese Web has not become a Daisy yet because its SCC is still smaller than half of the graph and both OUT and Disc/Tendrils are still sizable . It appears that the Chinese Web looks more like a Teapot ( Figure 1 ) . The Teapot graph also differs from an earlier Chinese web graph [ 3 ] , most noticeable in the size of SCC ( 44 % vs . 80% ) , which might be attributed to differences in time , crawling strategy , and other factors . 3.2 Hierarchical Structure Also shown in Table 1 ( columns 5 and 6 ) , the Chinese Web becomes increasingly closer to the Daisy shape when it is progressively aggregated from pages to hosts and domains . When links into hosts/domains , the latter expectedly become more connected , resulting in a larger SCC ( from 44 % at the page level to 51 % at

4 . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper , we present a large scale experiment on the graph properties of Chinese Web . A Teapot Graph is constructed as alternative to the classic Bow Tie or Daisy Graphs . A three layer structure is further considered for the national Web . The most unexpected finding is the absence of self similarity between pagelevel and host/domain levels . In addition , the existence of a large number of hosts with only single page in the current data set may have introduced extraneous influences to the resulting graphs across all three levels . In future work , we will examine the reasons behind the dramatic change in the relative proportions of IN and OUT and identify content , technical , and geographic features of the web pages and sites appearing in different components of the structures .
