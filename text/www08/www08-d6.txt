ABSTRACT As the number of telephony voice applications grow , there will be a need for a browser to surf the Web of interconnected voice applications ( called as VoiceSites ) . These VoiceSites are accessed through a telephone over an audio channel . We present the concept and architecture of T Web Browser , a World Wide Telecom Web browser that enables browsing the Web of voice applications through an ordinary phone . This browser will support rich browsing features such as history and bookmarking .

INTRODUCTION
Currently , voice applications are accessed using a telephone device as shown in Figure 1 . A Voice Browser is used to access multiple applications A1 , A2 , , An that are hosted on the same Application Server ( App Server in the figure ) . Since all the voice applications are on the same server , and are accessed by the same Voice Browser , it is possible for the Application Server to maintain a browsing history of the applications being browsed . The applications A1 to An can provide a link to each other [ 1 ] .

However , in this architecture , the Voice Browser at the first site will not be able to surf a link from an application in set A to any application in B . How to enable surfing such cross browser links is the problem we address in this paper . By allowing a voice application on one Voice Browser to link to another voice application deployed on another Voice

Browser , the reachability of these applications can be significantly increased . This is analogous to the web applications in the World Wide Web , where any website can connect to any other website , regardless of where they are deployed .
Continuing the Web analogy further , we have shown that creating and deploying voice applications ( called VoiceSites ) is as easy as creating a webpage [ 3 ] . This is especially important for people in developing countries where Internet/PC availability is low , since creating VoiceSites can be done by speaking through an ordinary telephone . We also described the process of enabling hyperspeech link to another voice application . and presented a Hyperspeech Transfer Protocol to support hyperspeech links [ 2 ] . Such an interconnection of VoiceSites open several possibilities for telephony voice applications and can create a web parallel to the WWW , known as WWTW [ 4 ] .
As an example , a fisherman can create his VoiceSite that has information and pricing of the fishes available with him . He can link his VoiceSite to a payment gateway VoiceSite to enable transactions . Villagers can call his VoiceSite and order a fish and make payment while the fisherman is busy at his lake farm . In a practical scenario , it is likely that these two VoiceSites are hosted at different Voice Browsers .
In this paper , we present the concept and architecture of a T Web Browser . This browser will enable navigation of interlinked voice applications that are deployed across different Voice Browsers . The architecture illustrates that the Browser can be implemented as a special VoiceSite ( Section 2 ) and can support standard browsing features such as go back and bookmark . The T Web browser can also be implemented on the device itself , but that would require speech recognition support on the device .
2 . WWTW BROWSER ARCHITECTURE
We implement the T Web Browser as a special VoiceSite . In addition to a dialog flow ( authored as VoiceXML jsp ) , the T Web Browser VoiceSite uses a database to maintain a history of the current user session . It uses an additional database to store the caller bookmarks . The history consists of the title and the phone numbers of the VoiceSites called by the user . The bookmarks contain the phone number and a name tag for each bookmarked VoiceSite . The operational model of the T Web Browser is shown in Figure 2 .
We describe the working of T Web Browser using the cir cled steps shown in the figure .
1 . User calls the T Web Browser to access a VoiceSite . 2 . The T Web Browser transfers the call to the phone number of the VoiceSite through HSTP .

Figure 2 : The T Web Browser interaction with VoiceSites .
3 . When a user selects a hyperspeech link to browse to the other VoiceSite , the session is transferred to the target VoiceSite and HSTP passes the call transfer information to the T Web Browser .
4 . This information is stored in the Browser history . 5 . The user issues a Browser command , eg go back . 6 . The T Web Browser instructs the HSTP layer on the current VoiceSite to initiate a transfer to the earlier VoiceSite phone number .
7 . At anytime , the user can say bookmark to bookmark the currently browsed VoiceSite .
The HSTP layer implements the protocol for transfer of user session from one VoiceSite to another . We will have to modify the HSTP protocol and the message format for it to support browsing features . An additional field will have to be added to the HSTP message . This is the phone number of the next VoiceSite to which the user will surf . The current VoiceSite application context will be transmitted to the TWeb Browser in the application context field of the HSTP message .
The above architecture requires that a user can access the VoiceSite and the T Web Browser simultaneously . This requires the availability of two simultaneous voice channels from the user phone . This can be realised in two ways : ( a ) through a three party conference call between the user , the T Web Browser and the VoiceSite , ( b ) by having both the voice channels active , and the user can put one channel on hold while talking through the other . The first approach requires that the VoiceSite and the T Web Browser should be able to disambiguate the user utterance and identify whether it is a command to the browser or an interaction with the VoiceSite . The latter approach needs a phone ( and the service provider ) that has the ability to provide two simultaneously active calls . Since neither of the two requirements are unsurmountable , any of these methods can be used in the implementation of the T Web Browser .
This architecture can support rich browsing features similar to multi tabbed browsing on the WWW by enabling simultaneous active calls to different VoiceSites . A user can put other VoiceSites on hold while interacting with one .
2.1 Implementation
We have implemented the HSTP protocol layer that will enable the call and context transfer required by the T Web Browser . The HSTP protocol has been implemented as a Java class library and the API can be accessed from any VoiceXML application through a Java Bean . We are in the process of developing the prototype of the T Web Browser VoiceSite . The VoiceSite will be authored in VoiceXML jsp . We will deploy this VoiceSite in Apache TomCat . This will be accessed through phone calls that are intercepted by the Dialogic telephony card . We use the Genesys Voice Browser to interpret VoiceXML .
3 . CONCLUSION
In this paper , we briefly presented the requirement for a Browser that can browse VoiceSites that are deployed across domains . We described the concept and a high level architecture of a T Web Browser that is implemented as a VoiceSite . We are in the process of implementing this browser , and keenly await user feedback through field studies .
