ABSTRACT In this paper , targeting delicious tag data , we propose a method , FolksoViz , for deriving subsumption relationships between tags by using Wikipedia texts , and visualizing a folksonomy . To fulfill this method , we propose a statistical model for deriving subsumption relationships based on the frequency of each tag on the Wikipedia texts , as well as the TSD ( Tag Sense Disambiguation ) method for mapping each tag to a corresponding Wikipedia text . The derived subsumption pairs are visualized effectively on the screen . The experiment shows that the FolksoViz manages to find the correct subsumption pairs with high accuracy .

1 . INTRODUCTION Folksonomy is one of the most noticeable features in the current Web 2.0 , which originated from combining the words ‘folk’ and ‘taxonomy’ . Folksonomy is also widely known as ‘collaborative tagging’ . If we refer to tags as web metadata that describe a web document , collaborative tagging is achieved collaboratively by many taggers who assign a list of keywords , or tags , as metadata . Delicious[1 ] is said to be the true implementation of collaborative tagging . It provides an online social bookmarking service that enables users to register their own bookmarks and share them with others . Each user can assign several tags to a URL , and the whole set of tags created for that URL will be open to the public in a form of posting history . Unfortunately , there have been no adequate ways to visualize this folksonomy other than using tag clouds . However , a tag cloud is just a representation of the top k tags according to their frequency , and this may not be useful to provide an intuitive summary of the whole folksonomy . Furthermore , it does not provide any information about the relationships between the tags . Under this situation , if we are able to find se

In this paper , we propose a method , named FolksoViz , for deriving subsumption relationships between tags and visualizing the derived subsumption pairs on the screen .
2 . DERIVING SUBSUMPTION PAIRS 2.1 Basic Idea and Assumptions In this section , we propose a statistical model for deriving subsumption relationships based on the co occurrence and the frequency of each tag on Wikipedia[2 ] texts ( Figure 1 ) . Each tag is mapped to one corresponding Wikipedia text that describes the sense of the tag . Then , our metric for retrieving subsumption relationships is applied to every tag pair . The pair that has the calculated value over a predefined threshold is chosen as the subsumption pair . The reason why we chose the Wikipedia texts was that Wikipedia can act as the best reference to the senses of each tag in delicious ( In fact , Wikipedia is known as the best reflection of ‘the wisdom of crowds’ or ‘the collective intelligence’ ) . For this purpose , we needed to make three assumptions . First , all the tags in delicious are treated as nouns . Second , each tag in delicious is mapped to at least one Wikipedia text . And lastly , the information from that Wikipedia text is good enough to fully describe the sense of the tag .

2.2 Modeling for Deriving Subsumption Pairs Our model adopted the basic idea from [ 3 ] . However , to reflect the characteristics of delicious tags and Wikipedia , we made a slight modification to the original model . It is defined as follows , for two tags , x and y , x subsumes y if
TF(y|Wiki(x ) ) < TF(x|Wiki(y) ) , μ < TF(x|Wiki(y ) ) where Wiki(a ) is the Wikipedia text that tag a is mapped to , TF(b|Wiki(a ) ) is the term frequency of tag b on the Wiki(a ) , and μ is the threshold value that is determined empirically . In other words , tag x subsumes tag y if 1 ) x is more frequent on the Wikipedia text of y than y is on the Wikipedia text of x , and 2 ) x occurs on the Wikipedia text of y to some degree . And , empirically , the quality was best when μ was 001

Considering that a word can have a number of distinct senses , it is essential to find the right Wikipedia text that best describes the sense of a tag . For example , a tag ‘apple’ may refer to either a sort of fruit or the Apple Incorporation . Therefore , we should determine which Wikipedia text will best refer and correspond to a tag . This kind of work is called word sense disambiguation ( WSD ) . However , we renamed it as tag sense disambiguation ( TSD ) . The basic idea of TSD is that a sense of a tag can be determined by the help of its neighboring tags ( Figure 2 ) . This is plausible because those tags that are attached to the same target are very likely to be related to each other in their meanings . We choose among the several senses the sense whose Wikipedia text records the largest sum of term frequencies of its neighboring tags . The detailed algorithm will not be introduced here due to the space limitation .

3 . FOLKSONOMY VISUALIZATION 3.1 Principles for Folksonomy Visualization The retrieved subsumption pairs should be visualized so that the readers may understand it intuitively . Thus , we set five principles for effective folksonomy visualization . 1 ) All subsumption pairs should be displayed on one screen , and the displayed tags are the top 50 tags which users are most interested in . 2 ) The whole structure is a directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) since a tag can have more than one parent . 3 ) We assign a larger font size to a node whose tag has higher tag count ( as in the case of tag clouds ) . 4 ) In handling transitivity , we maintain every edge of pairs regardless of when they are transitive or not since the subsumption relationships are not always transitive . 5 ) Each node has a hyperlink for a tag search ( as in the case of tag clouds ) .
3.2 Analysis
Figure 3 . An example screenshot from the outputs .
According to the five principles , the subsumption pairs were visualized using JGraph[4 ] . Figure 3 shows an example of a screenshot that visualizes the delicious tags attached to a URL regarding the web design . The figure shows that FolksoViz generally exhibits fairly good performance , eg , ‘web’ subsumes ‘web2.0’ ,
‘design’ subsumes ‘webdesign’ , and ‘html’ subsumes ‘css’ . However , some pairs may look a little awkward , eg , ‘code’ subsumes ‘tools’ and ‘free’ subsumes ‘webdev’ . This may occur when the two tags are so closely interrelated that they often appear with each other . Moreover , FolksoViz is unable to handle singularplural tags , eg , ‘resource’ subsumes ‘resources’ , ‘color’ subsumes ‘colors’ , and ‘blog’ subsumes ‘blogs’ .
4 . EVALUATION The goal of our experiment is to figure out how correct the automatically derived subsumption pairs are . To achieve this goal , a group of 15 PhD students were chosen as subjects , who were majoring in computer science and well aware of a wide variety of technical terminologies ( They were assumed to be the domain experts ) . The target 10 URLs were chosen from the top 10 popular topics of delicious From each of the URLs , 30 subsumption pairs were chosen by random ( Total of 300 pairs were chosen ) . For each pair , the subject was asked to judge that the subsumption relationship of two tags looked a ) Correct , b ) Inverted , c ) Synonymous , d ) Not correct , but related , e ) Neither correct nor related , or f ) I don’t know . Table 1 shows the results . The high proportion of “ Correct ” ( 58.4 % ) and the low proportion of “ Inverted ” ( 1.3 % ) and “ Neither correct nor related ” ( 7.8 % ) are promising . The proportions of “ Synonymous ” ( 4.1 % ) and “ Not correct , but related ” ( 14.8 % ) show the limitations in our method . And , many subjects answered with “ I don’t know ” ( 13.8% ) , mainly because we could not handle the singular plural tags , and partly because some relationships were unobvious in judging from the tags alone .
