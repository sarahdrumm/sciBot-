1 . INTRODUCTION With the rapid growth of wireless technologies and mobile devices , there is a great demand for personalized services in mcommerce . Providing personalized services is about a process of matching users and merchants based on their profiles and preferences in conjunction with a changing environment constituting several context factors such as time , location and weather . In our previous work [ 1 ] , we have demonstrated that effective representations of information relationships among user , content and context can enhance the personalized services of the system . However , we only adopted a single criterion to rate the extent to which a user is interested in an item in a standard 2D space . But multicriteria ratings have an important impact on many applications . For example , in a food industry for m commerce , service , cuisine , and distance are three significant criteria for restaurant ratings . In fact , multicriteria ratings for an item can provide us more precise approximations to the similarity between two users than the overall rating since they give a good insight into why users like the item whereas the latter can only tell us how much users like it [ 5 ] .

Inspired by the technique of multi dimensional collaborative filtering in e commerce [ 4 ] , we propose a novel MSVD based CF approach in m commerce , which incorporates contextual information and multicriteria ratings into the recommendation process and enriches our previous work [ 1 ] . The basic idea of this paper is to first identify similar contextual information to that of the active mobile user , and then recognize the nearest neighbors of the user based on the MSVD technique under some relevant context information , and at last perform personalized services based on those found similar neighbors . Within this framework , a 3 order tensor is used to represent the 3D data , and the truncated MSVD technique is utilized to explore the underlying relations among user , item and criterion . The framework can take full advantages of the multi dimensional representation capability of a higherorder tensor , the approximation capability of the MSVD , and the function of collaborative filtering .

2.1 The Tensor based Recommendation Space Inspired by the ideas of the papers [ 2][3][4 ] , we define the new recommendation space of m commerce by a 4 order tensor as follows , where the contextual information of a user and the multicriteria ratings of an item are added to the traditional space : Definition1 Recommendation Space : The matrix representation , of recommendation space is a 4 order tensor where U , I , are sets of users , content items , contexts and criteria . In our system , contextual information includes mobile user's location , time , weather and user activity . Both context and content informaiton is obtained by the similar process of our previous

Multicriteria of an item are presented in terms of practical tensor of recommendation space to the 3 order tensor by utilizing the context pertinent to that of active user . The data are much sparser since fewer data points having similar contexts to active user are used for rating . The truncated MSVD technique is proposed in the following part to analyze the underlying relations among user , item and criterion . 2.2 The MSVD based Collaborative Filtering Each element of the above reduced 3 order tensor represents the rating of pair on a criterion under a specific context . The multilinear SVD of an N order tensor is defined as follows :

Based on the works in [ 1][2][4 ] , we perform the inference by the truncated MSVD technique for m commerce as follows : Step1 : For an active mobile user , identify his/her context information ; Step2 : Based on the context information , and the 3order tensor representation of recommendation space , we perform the tensor approximation based on the truncated MSVD technique , which reveals both explicit relations and implicit relations among user , item and criterion ; Step3 : Find active user's nearest neighborhoods according to the approximated tensor and then perform top N recommendations based on the rating information of the found neighbors . 3 . EXPERIMENTAL RESULT We implement the proposed method in an existing m commerce platform of food industry to provide Top N recommendation , and compare its recommendation quality against that of our previous method [ 1 ] . The previous method provides recommendation by a multi dimensional collaborative filtering , and does not consider multicriteria ratings . The cosine based similarity metric and the maximum recommendation number of items are used in our experiment . We explore the survey to gather the user preference information , namely , each user is asked to give multicriteria ratings ( 10 criteria considered : cuisine , ambience , service , etc . ) for a restaurant item under a specific context . All the above data are stored in Data Service Layer of the m commerce platform . The resulting data set includes 200 users and 30 restaurants items . The data set is divided into 80 % training set and 20 % test set . The quality of recommendation is measured by precision , which is widely used in information retrieval area . We compute the average precisions on test set . The comparison result of our method and previous one ( without considering multicriteria ratings ) is shown in Figure 3 .
Figure ３ : Average precision comparisons of two methods
From the results , we can find that the precision of the newly proposed method is higher than that of previous one . The results show that the new method can identify the similarity relations among user efficiently , and therefore improves the quality of recommender system .

CONCLUSIONS and FUTURE WORK In this paper , we presented a novel multicriteria rating approach to improve personalized services in m commerce , which utilized the MSVD technique to explore the underlying relations among user , item and criterion . Experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method . Choosing the rank of truncated MSVD to get the optimal approximation in m commerce application is still difficult and remains the subject of ongoing research . 5 .
