ABSTRACT Seed selection is of significant importance for the biased PageRank algorithms such as TrustRank to combat link spamming . Previous work usually uses a small seed set , which has a big problem that the top ranking results have a strong bias towards seeds . In this paper , we analyze the relationship between the result bias and the number of seeds . Furthermore , we experimentally show that an automatically selected large seed set can work better than a carefully selected small seed set .

INTRODUCTION
Web spam is one of the most intractable mischievousness to the search engines . They exploit many illegal means to benefit from high ranking positions . Many link based antispamming techniques have been proposed so far[1 , 3 , 2 , 4 ] for combating them . In general these approaches are all biased PageRank algorithms . As mentioned in previous work [ 1 , 4 ] , the seed selection plays an important role in differing good pages from bad ones . Traditional approaches such as TrustRank[1 ] and ParentPenalty[3 ] usually use a manual process to carefully select a small seed set . However , this process is always time consuming . It is lumbersome and awkward for periodical refreshing of the seed sets , especially ∗ Corresponding author

Besides , when the number of seeds is small , the top ranking results are almost all occupied by seeds or their neighbors due to the refilled value of each seed per iteration in these algorithms . As far as we know , until recently no previous work has taken these issues into consideration . In this paper , we demonstrate our preliminary results on these research points .
2 . RESULT BIAS ANALYSIS
Among all of the biased PageRank algorithms , propagating rank values via links from a small seed set is a general option . However , using a small seed set has a big problem : the ranking results have a strong bias towards seeds . That is , the top ranking results are always occupied by the seeds . The bias is mainly due to the damping factor . During the computation , each seed will be refilled with ( 1 − αd ) · 1/Ns after each iteration , where αd is damping factor and Ns is the number of seeds . Therefore , the side effect is large when the seed set is small . So seeds can occupy most of the top positions in the final result . To reduce this result bias , a feasible way is increasing the number of seeds for reducing the refilled value . Since the number of seeds cannot be guaranteed always enough , we should decide the minimal number . The point is how many top results are users concerned . If a user only concerns top 100 results and wishes they are less affected by result bias , the number of seeds can be small . Whereas a user concerns a large range of top ranking results , the number of seeds should be large .
In actual fact we can estimate the number of seeds using the assumption as follows : when we concern top N results , we assume that if ( 1−αd)·1/Ns is less than the ( γN )th page ’s score ( γ is an expansion coefficient ) , it is less effected by result bias . So we can first get the ( γN )th page ’s score then calculate the number of seeds . For example , when N = 100 , γ = 10 and αd = 0.85 , if the 1000th page has a score of 4 × 10
−5 , we can get Ns = 3750 .
3 . EXPERIMENT
We perform experiments on a partial set of pages crawled by Tianwang search engine ( developed by network lab , Peking University ) in Nov . 2005 . It contains 13.3 M pages with about 232 M links on 358,245 sites , most of which belong to .cn domain . 3.1 Result Bias and Number of Seeds
With TrustRank[1 ] , we start from 50 seeds and double the number each time . At each point , we randomly select
1065WWW 2008 / Poster PaperApril 21 25 , 2008 · Beijing , China different seed set 4 times and calculate the average number of seeds that top 100 and top 1000 results contain . The result is shown in Table 1 . It indicates that the top results are nearly all occupied by seeds when the seed set is small . The number of seeds in top 100 results reaches the nadir at the case of 3200 .

To explore this trend more preciously , we start from 1600 seeds and enlarge the number by 100 each time . We perform this experiment four times at each point and get the average . The result is shown in Figure 1 . The x axis shows the number of seeds while the y axis represents the corresponding ratio . We see this ratio runs to stable when the number of seeds is about 4000 . By checking the scores , we find the 1000th site ’s TrustRank value is about 3.98 × 10 −5 , which is perfectly matched with our estimation in Section 2 . s t l u s e R 0 0 1 p o T n i s d e e S f o o i t a R

Figure 2 : The bucket level demotion of TrustRank scores with different seed sets
To compare the anti spamming abilities of different seed sets , we select a small seed set X using a method similar to TrustRank [ 1 ] . At the same time , we select all the sites in the .gov domain and .edu domain as a large seed set L . Figure 2 shows the bucket level demotion of TrustRank scores when using X and L . Good sites ( reputable and directory ) with high rankings have little demotion , ie retain high ranking values . There is no obvious difference when using these two seed sets . The average demotion of the good sites is almost less than 4 . However , spam sites have more demotion and using L is much better than using X . The demotions are always larger than 5.8 with L .
4 . CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
In this paper , we reveal that a large seed set can achieve a better performance than a small seed set on detecting web spam for biased PageRank algorithms . What is more , instead of carefully selecting a small seed set , we can select a large number of seeds automatically . For example , we can just select sites in the .gov and .edu domains as seeds . No doubt that this process is time saving . So when using a large seed set , we can obtain good result as well as simplification of selecting process .
Our future work will explore some unanswered question about seeds selection . For example , how to exploit large seed sets more effectively and can we get “ useful ” bad seeds from good ones ? We will focus on these problems in the future .

3.2 Combating Link Spamming
In order to find out the impact of the number of seeds on the ability of combating link spamming , we use a method similar to that in TrustRank[1 ] . We generate a list of sites in descending order of their PageRank scores and segment these sites into 20 buckets . Each of the buckets contains a different number of sites with scores summing up to 5 % of the total PageRank scores . We construct a sample set of 1000 sites by selecting 50 sites at random from each bucket . Then we perform a manual evaluation to determine their categories . Each site is classified into one of the following categories : reputable , spam , pure directory , and personal blog . Any site uses any spamming techniques will be put
