ABSTRACT Wikipedia , “ the free encyclopedia ” , now contains over two million English articles , and is widely regarded as a highquality , authoritative encyclopedia . Some Wikipedia articles , however , are of questionable quality , and it is not always apparent to the visitor which articles are good and which are bad . We propose a simple metric – word count – for measuring article quality . In spite of its striking simplicity , we show that this metric significantly outperforms the more complex methods described in related work .

INTRODUCTION
As user generated content grows in prominence , many web sites have employed complex mechanisms to help visitors identify high quality content . Wikipedia maintains a list of “ featured ” articles that serve as exemplars of good usergenerated content . For an article to be featured , it must survive a rigorous nomination and peer review process ; only one article in every thousand makes the cut . Unfortunately , this is a laborious process , and many worthy articles never get the official stamp of approval . Thus , it might be useful to have an automatic means for detecting articles of unusually high quality .
A substantial amount of work has been done to automatically evaluate the quality of Wikipedia articles . At a qualitative level , Lih [ 3 ] proposed using the total number of edits and unique editors to measure article quality , and Cross [ 2 ] suggested coloring text according to age so that visitors could immediately discern its quality . Both studies , however , were primarily qualitative , and did not measure the discriminative value of such heuristics .
The quantitative approaches found in related work tend [ 6 ] , for instance , used a to be quite complex . Zeng et al . dynamic bayesian network to develop a measure of trust and quality based on the edit history of an article . Adler and de Alfaro [ 1 ] devised similar metrics to quantify the reputation of authors and editors . In the work closest to our own ,

Stvilia et al . [ 5 ] , computed 19 quantitative metrics , then used factor analysis and k means clustering to differentiate featured from random articles .
2 . METHODS
In contrast to the complex quantitative methods found in related work , we propose a much simpler measure of quality for Wikipedia articles : the length of the article , measured in words . While there are many limitations to such a metric , there is good reason to believe that this metric will be correlated to quality ( see Figure 1 ) . The simplicity of this metric presents several advantages :
( cid:129 ) article length is easy to measure ; ( cid:129 ) many of the approaches mentioned in section 1 require information that is not easily obtained ( such as the revision and history used in [ 6 ] , [ 4 ] , and [ 1] ) ; ( cid:129 ) other approaches typically operate in a black box fashion , with arcane parameters and results that are not easily interpreted by the average visitor to Wikipedia ; ( cid:129 ) article length performs significantly better than other , more complex methods .

To test the performance of article length as a discriminant between high and low quality articles , we followed the approach taken by Zeng et al . [ 6 ] and Stvilia et al . [ 5 ] That is , instead of comparing our metric against a scalar measure of article quality , we assume that featured articles are of much higher quality than random articles , and recast the problem as a classification task . The goal is thus to maximize precision and recall of featured and non featured articles .
To build a corpus , we extracted the full 5,654,236 articles from the 7/28/2007 dump of the English Wikipedia .

Table 1 : Performance of word count in classifying featured vs . random articles .
After stripping all Wikipedia related markup , we removed specialized files ( such as images and templates ) and articles containing fewer than fifty words . This cleaned dataset contained 1,554 articles classified as “ featured ” ; we randomly selected an additional 9,513 cleaned articles to serve as a non featured “ random ” corpus . Our corpus thus contained a total of 11,067 articles . In the experiments described below , we used 2/3 of the articles for training ( 7,378 articles ) and 1/3 for testing ( 3,689 articles ) , with a similar ratio of featured/random articles in each set .
3 . RESULTS
By classifying articles with greater than 2,000 words as “ featured ” and those with fewer than 2,000 words as “ random , ” we achieved 96.31 % accuracy in the binary classification task.1 The threshold was found by minimizing the error rate on the training set ( see Figure 2 ) . The reported accuracy results from testing on the held out test set .
Modest improvements could be produced by more sophisticated classification techniques . A multi layer perceptron , for instance , achieved an overall accuracy of 97.15 % , with an f measure of .902 for featured articles and .983 for random articles ( see Table 1 ) . Similar results were replicated with a k nearest neighbor classifier ( 96.94 % accuracy ) , a logit model ( 96.74 % accuracy ) , and a random forest classifier ( 95.80 % accuracy ) . All techniques represent a significant improvement over the more complex methods in Stvilia et [ 4 ] and Zeng et al . al . [ 6 ] , which produced 84 % and 86 % accuracy , respectively .

Word count threshold
Figure 2 : Accuracy of different thresholds
Given the high accuracy of the word count metric , we naturally wondered whether other simple metrics might increase classification accuracy . In other contexts , features such as part of speech tags , readability metrics , and n gram bag ofwords have been moderately successful . In the context of Wikipedia quality , however , we found that word count was hard to beat . N gram bag of words classification , for instance , produced a maximum of 81 % accuracy ( tested with n=1,2,3 on both svm and bayesian classifiers ) . Even using a 1A slightly higher accuracy of 96.46 % was achieved with a threshold of 1,830 words .
“ kitchen sink ” of thirty features such as those listed in Table 2 , no classifier achieved greater than 97.99 % accuracy – a modest improvement given the considerable effort required to produce these metrics and build the classifiers .

4 . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
We have shown that article length is a very good predictor of whether an article will be featured on Wikipedia . Word count is a simple metric that is considerably more accurate than the complex methods proposed in related work , and performs well independent of classification algorithm and parameters .
We do not , however , mean to exaggerate the importance of this metric . By assuming that “ featured ” status is an accurate proxy for quality , we have implied that quality can be measured via article length . However , if our assumption does not hold , then we can only conclude that long articles are featured , and featured articles are long . Future work will explore alternative standards for quality on Wikipedia .
