ABSTRACT Semantic web ontology languages , such as OWL , have been widely used for knowledge representation . Through empirical analysis of real world ontologies we discover that , like many natural and social phenomenon , the semantic web ontology is also “ scale free ” .

1 . INTRODUCTION It is widely believed that Semantic Web ontologies provide a solution to the knowledge management and integration challenges . The ontology languages such as RDF , DAML+OIL and OWL can serve for knowledge representation . A great deal of efforts is being invested in using Semantic Web ontologies to create mutually agreeable and consistent vocabularies to describe terminology and data from disparate sources [ 1 ] . For example , the NCI Thesaurus Ontology developed and actively maintained by the National Cancer Institute is an OWL ontology . It defines 60,000+ named classes , a roughly equal number of anonymous classes and 100,000+ connections these classes . The OpenGALEN project also created biomedical ontologies with more than 35,000 concepts involved .
( properties )
It is natural to consider a semantic web ontology as a large network , where nodes are entities ( classes and individuals ) and links are relationships among entities . Formally , an ontology can be viewed as a graph G=<N , E> , where N is a set of nodes representing entities , and E is a set of edges representing properties that link nodes . These properties include both OWL properties ( such as owl:subclassOf , owl:equivalentClasses , etc . ) and userdefined properties . As an example , Figure 1 shows the network view of the ProPreO ontology , which describes Proteomics data and process and is developed by the National Center for Research Resources ( NCRR ) . In this paper , we show that a large ontology network such as the one shown in Figure 1 is “ scale free ” .

2 . DISCOVERING THE SCALE FREE
NATURE OF ONTOLOGY
It is discovered that many complex networks , such as the Internet , WWW , scientific citations , protein interactions or language networks , are scale free [ 2 , 3 ] . The term “ scale free ” comes from the fact that the structure and dynamics of such networks are independent of the scale of the networks . The distinguish characteristics of scale free networks is that nodes in such networks are not randomly or evenly connected . On the contrary , some nodes are highly connected , acting as “ hubs" that connects the rest of the nodes . For example , a study of S . cerevisiae proteinprotein interaction network shows that about 93 % of the proteins have five or fewer connections , while only 0.7 % of the proteins have more than 15 connections [ 4 ] . More specifically , the degree distribution of nodes in scale free networks follows the power law , such that the probability that a node is connected to k other nodes is proportional to : p(k ) = C k a where C is a constant and a is the exponent of the power law . Taking the logarithm on both sides of the above equation , we get ln(p(k ) ) = ln(C ) aln(k ) . So a power law distribution is seen as a straight line on a log log plot . The slope of the line is a and the intercept is log(C ) .
Figure 1 . The ontology network of the ProPreO ontology . To check if ontology network such as the one shown in Figure 1 is scale free , we have collected a set of real world biological and biomedical ontologies ( as shown in Table 1 ) . To facilitate automated data collection , we have also developed a tool , which traverses an ontology network , collects & stores relevant

Figure 2 shows the degree distributions of the ontology FullGalen and NCI Ontology . The distributions form straight lines in log log diagrams , revealing the power law behavior . Table 1 shows the best fit power law parameters for all studied ontologies . The exponent a ranges from 2.12 to 247 The corresponding R2 ranges from 0.91 to 0.99 , indicating good fitness of the data ( at the significant level 000 )

3 . CONCLUSIONS In this short note we show that , like many natural and social phenomenon , the semantic web ontology is “ scale free ” . We derive the findings through empirical analysis of the degree distribution of ontology networks . that implies
The power law distribution of degrees the knowledge represented by semantic web ontology can be very inhomogeneous : while the majority of concepts use ( refer to ) a few other concepts , a small number of concepts use ( refer to ) a large number of other concepts . The concepts that have large degrees could be treated as more “ essential ” knowledge points , as they attract more connections . More efforts are probably needed to understand and learn them . During maintenance , special cares need to be taken when changes to these concepts are made , as the changes may be propagated to a large proportion of the ontology.1 REFERENCES [ 1 ] Ashburner , M . et al . , Gene ontology : tool for the unification of biology . the gene ontology consortium .
