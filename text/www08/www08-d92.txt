ABSTRACT Name ambiguity problem has been a challenging issue for a long history . In this paper , we intend to make a thorough investigation of the whole problem . Specifically , we formalize the name disambiguation problem in a unified framework . The framework can incorporate both attribute and relationship into a probabilistic model . We explore a dynamic approach for automatically estimating the person number K and employ an adaptive distance measure to estimate the distance between objects . Experimental results show that our proposed framework can significantly outperform the baseline method .

1 . INTRODUCTION Name disambiguation is a very critical problem in many knowledge management applications , such as Digital Libraries and Semantic Web applications . We have examined one hundred person names and found that the problem is very serious . For example , there are 54 papers authored by 25 “ Jing Zhang ” . Even , there are three “ Yi Li ” graduated from the author ’s lab . In this paper , we propose a unified probabilistic framework to offer solutions to the above challenges . We explore a dynamic approach for estimating the person number K . We propose a unified probabilistic model . The model can achieve better performance in name disambiguation than the existing methods .
2 . NAME DISAMBIGUATION 2.1 Notations The problem can be described as : Given a person name a , let all publications containing the author named a as P={p1 , p2 , … , pn} . Suppose there existing k actual researchers {y1 , y2 , … , yk} having the name a , our task is to assign these n publications to their real researcher yi .

We define five types of undirected relationships between papers . Table 1 shows the relationships . Relationship r1 represents that two papers are published at the same conference/journal . Relationship r2 means two papers have a secondary author with the same name , and relationship r3 means one paper cites the other paper .

We use an example to explain relationship r5 . Suppose pi has authors “ David Mitchell ” and “ Andrew Mark ” , and pj has authors “ David Mitchell ” and “ Fernando Mulford ” . ( We are going to disambiguate “ David Mitchell ” . ) If “ Andrew Mark ” and “ Fernando Mulford ” also coauthor one paper , then we say pi and pj have a 2CoAuthor relationship . 2.2 Our Approach The proposed framework is based on Hidden Markov Random Fields [ 1 ] , which can be used to model dependencies between observations ( here each paper can be viewed as an observation ) . Then for each disambiguation task , we propose using the Bayesian Information Criterion ( BIC ) [ 2 ] as the criterion to estimate the person number K . We define an objective function for the disambiguation task . Our goal is to optimize a parameter setting that maximizes the objective function with some given K . Figure 1 shows the graphical structure of the HMRF model to the name disambiguation problem . The edge between the hidden variables corresponds to the relationships between papers . The value of each hidden variable indicates the assignment results . By the fundamental theorem of random fields [ 3 ] , the probability distribution of the label configuration Y has the form :
P Y ( )
=
1 Z 1 exp(
−∑ ∑ i
( y y , i j
) ∈ f y y ( , i j
) )
E i
( 1 ) where potential function f(yi , yj ) is a non negative function defined based on the edge ( yi , yj ) and Ei represents all neighborhoods related to yi . Z1 is a normalization factor . Our goal ( MAP ) the maximum a posteriori configuration of the HMRF , ie maximize P(Y|X ) . Suppose P(X ) ) is a constant , then we get by the Bayes rule . Therefore , our objective function is defined as :
P Y P X Y (

Then the problem is how to define the potential function f and how to estimate the generative probability P(xi|yi ) . We define the potential function f(yi , yj ) by the distance D(xi , xj ) between paper pi and pj . As for the probability P(xi|yi ) , we assume that publications is generated under the spherical Gaussian distribution and thus we have :
P x ( i

2.3 EM Algorithm Three tasks are executed by Expectation Maximization ( EM ) : learning parameters of the distance measure , re assignment of each paper to a cluster , and update of cluster centroid u(i ) . We define the distance function D(xi , xj ) as follows [ 1 ] : x T i || x A j x ||
||
|| x i
D x x ,
( i
) 1 = − j
, where || x i

A here A is a parameter matrix . The EM process can be summarized as follows : in the E step , given the current cluster centroid , every paper xi is re assigned to the cluster by maximizing p(yi|xi ) . In the M step , the cluster centers are re estimated based on the assignments to minimize the objective function L ; and the parameter matrix is updated to increase the objective function . 2.4 Estimation of K Our proposed strategy ( see Algorithm 1 ) is to start by setting K as 1 and use the BIC score to measure whether to split the current cluster . The algorithm runs iteratively . In each iteration , we try to split every cluster C into two sub clusters . We calculate a local BIC score of the new sub model M2 . Given BIC(M2 ) > BIC(M1 ) , we split the cluster . We calculate a global BIC score for the obtained new model . The process continues if there exists split . Finally , we use the global BIC score as the criterion to choose as output the model with the highest score . BIC score is defined as

For the parameter |λ| , we simply define it as the sum of the K cluster probabilities , weight of the relations , and cluster centroids . 2.5 Experimental Results To evaluate our method , we created two datasets , namely Abbreviated Name and Real Name . The first dataset contains 10 abbreviated names ( eg ‘C . Chang’ ) and the second data set has two real person names ( eg ‘Jing Zhang’ ) . We evaluated the performances of our method and the baseline methods ( K means ) on the two data sets . Results show that our method can significantly outperform the baseline method for name disambiguation ( +46.54 % on Abbreviate Name data set and +41.35 % on Real Name data set in terms of the average F1 score ) . We evaluated the effectiveness of estimation of the person number K . We have found that the estimated numbers by our approach are close to the results by human labeled . We applied Xmeans to find the person number K . We found that X means fails to find the actual number . It always outputs only one cluster except “ Yi Li ” with 2 . See [ 4][5 ] for more evaluation results . To further evaluate the effectiveness of our method , we applied it to expert finding and people association finding . For expert finding , in terms of mean average precision ( MAP ) , 2 % improvements can be obtained . For people association finding , we selected five pairs of person names and searched in ArnetMiner system , averagely 20 % improvements can be obtained .
3 . CONCLUSION In this paper , we have investigated the problem of name disambiguation . We have proposed a generalized probabilistic model to the problem . We have explored a dynamic approach for estimating the person number K . Experiments show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline methods .
