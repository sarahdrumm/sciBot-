Abstract—We present a novel visualization methodology for graphs and high dimensional data which combines the neighborhood preservation characteristics of the minimum spanning trees , with the grouping properties of dendrograms . We call the method ‘minimum spanning dendrogram’ . We highlight the ability of the mapping to accurately capture both neighborhood and cluster structures . The technique accommodates the interactive cluster formation at progressively more granular levels , allowing the user to explore data relationships at different resolutions . We also compare our work with other visualization methodologies , such as ISOMAP , and highlight the distinct merits of our approach .
I . INTRODUCTION
Data visualization is an inherent task in data analysis and data mining , because it “ forces us to see ” ( in the words of John Tukey ) hidden or obvious properties and relationships of the data examined . The abundance of highly dimensional and complex data intensifies the need for advanced visualization techniques that are able to translate the original object relationships into a form easily comprehensible by the human brain , ie , translated into two ( 2 ) or three ( 3 ) dimensions .
We present a mapping technique that provides a way of capturing both object relationships and cluster information . The methodology retains a subset of important distances very accurately : it preserves the distances to a selected pivot object and also the minimum spanning tree distances . This helps preserve the local structure of the underlying distance graph and partially also the global structure . In addition , our approach fuses 2D mapping techniques with dendrograms for resolving the cluster structure at different granularities . The dendrogram is overlayed ( either literally or metaphorically ) onto the third dimension ( ie , extruding from the 2D page plane ) to convey the cluster information . The user can visualize clusters at various granularities , starting from small , low level clusters and gradually advancing to higherlevel cluster structures .
Besides its usefulness for general data visualization , the proposed technique can offer meaningful ways of data exploration in the following application areas : tasks , such as revealing meaningful customer clusters , with the help of the interactive multi resolution feature it offers .
• Expanding on the above notion , the proposed data viewing paradigm can also be fruitfully realized in the context of Recommender Systems . Consider , for example , the case of major corporations that offer a range of products and services to their customers . It is of great interest not only to identify groups of customers interested in certain products but also the ‘order’ of approach to those customers ( eg , from most likely to least likely to buy ) . By providing the neighborhood graph , tasks like the aforementioned can be addressed in a more informative way .
• Advancing the understanding of Genetic Evolution . The technique that we put forward is perfectly tailored for identifying hierarchical cluster evolutions , which can be coupled with DNA analyses .
Based on the above discussion and applications , we succinctly summarize the advantages of the proposed technique which include : i ) Preservation of both local and global structures . ii ) Concurrent visualization of neighborhood and cluster structures . iii ) Multi granular data visualization . The user can select the desirable detail of visualization ( zoom in/zoom out capability ) . iv ) Ease of interpretation . Our technique adapts on widely utilized visualization primitives with which users have interacted before . From a usability perspective , this is very beneficial because many studies clearly suggest that “ exposure to similar conditions lays the groundwork for quicker and deeper comprehension ” [ 3 ] . v ) Our technique is agnostic on the distance function . The input to our technique can be any distance matrix between objects and the distance function can be either metric or non metric ( ie obey or not the triangle inequality ) .
II . DESCRIPTION OF OUR APPROACH
• Business Intelligence . An important task of marketing teams of every large company is market segmentation , that identifying groups of customers with similar buying characteristics . Our technique can simplify is ,
The proposed method combines the visual simplicity and comprehensibility of a spanning tree ( ST ) with a hierarchical clustering approach ( dendrogram ) . It enhances and augments such approaches in the following ways :
Firstly , the spanning tree layout in the 2D plane is constructed in such a way that all distances to a pivot point and neighbor distances within the ST are exactly preserved . This construction also considers how to best portray the object relationship for either metric or non metric distance functions . Secondly , the dendrogram cluster hierarchy is constructed so that it can be positioned exactly on top of the ST mapping of objects . The cluster hierarchy can be frozen at any resolution level ( tomographic view ) to convey the multi granular clusters that have formed . This concept is elucidated in Fig 1 ; objects are properly mapped on the 2D plane , whereas on the third dimension the hierarchy of the clustering structure is captured . Naturally , this is solely a conceptual illustration of our approach . In practice , cluster information is also projected onto two dimensions , eg , by properly coloring the nodes belonging to the same cluster . Therefore , by ‘cutting’ the derived dendrogram on a userdefined level , clusters on 2D can be formed expanded and contracted appropriately , as the user drills up or down on the cluster hierarchy .

The spanning tree structure is preserved and projected onto a 2D plane , while cluster structure is overlayed in the third dimension . By ‘cutting’ the dendrogram at a certain level the cluster structure can be conveyed to the nodes on 2D .
A . Neighborhood Preservation
We will explain first how to capture on two dimensions the relationship between a set of high dimensional objects . As not all pairwise distances can be retained on two dimensions we choose to maintain , as well as possible , the spanning tree distances which partially retain local structure and also record information about the general global structure [ 2 ] .
The approach begins by constructing the spanning tree ( ST ) on the original high dimensional objects . The tree can be mapped in many possible ways onto two dimensions . One object is selected as the pivot and mapped in the center of the 2D plane coordinate system . By traversing the spanning tree , objects are positioned on the 2D by triangulating the distances to two objects : the pivot object and the previously neighboring mapped point on the spanning tree . We illustrate how the mapping proceeds with a running example .

Figure 2 . Two dimensional mapping of objects/points using a minimum spanning tree order
Suppose the first two points ( A and B ) of the ST have already been mapped , as shown in Fig 2(a ) . Let ’s assume that the second distance preserved per object is the distance with respect to a reference point , which in our case is the first point . The third point is mapped at the intersection of circles centered at the reference points . The circles are centered at A and B with radii of D(A,C ) the distance between points A and C and D(B,C ) , respectively . Because of the triangle inequality , the circles either intersect at 2 positions or are tangent . Any position on the circles’ intersection will retain the original distances to the two reference points . The position of point C is shown in Fig 2(a ) . The fourth point is mapped at the intersection of the circles centered at A and C ( Fig 2(b ) ) and the fifth point is mapped similarly ( Fig 2(c) ) . The process continues until all points of the ST are positioned on the 2D plane , and the final result is shown in Fig 2(d ) .
This mapping technique will retain the original distances on 2D between all points and the pivot sequence , and also between the nodes that lie on the edges of the spanning tree . This creates a powerful visualization technique that not only allows nearest neighbor distances to be preserved(local structure ) , but in addition retains distances with respect to a single reference point , providing the option of a global data view using that object as pivot . As we will show in the experimental section , even though we do not directly retain the remaining pairwise distances , because we preserve the spanning tree ‘backbone’ of distances , they will also be well preserved ( even though on them no guarantees can be made ) .
B . Layout optimization using simulated annealing
Even though the focus of our mapping approach is on preservation of distance and structure , when dealing with data visualization , we also need to address issues such as clarity of display . Towards that goal , is generally advantageous to minimize the number of intersecting graph edges , so that connections between nodes are portrayed lucidly . We use a simulated annealing strategy for optimizing the placement of nodes . Recall that when triangulating the position of a third point toward the pivot and its neighbor , we identify the intersection between two circles . it
One can readily observe this in Figure 3 : there are two positions where a newly mapped point can be placed . The map here ?
X pivot
MST neighbor
X or here ?
Figure 3 . Selecting on which of the two positions to map a new point position of a point can affect the number of subsequent intersections with other edges . For this purpose , we employ a probabilistic global optimization technique based on simulated annealing ( SA ) principles [ 1 ] . SA is an effective optimization method when the search space is discrete , which is exactly the situation we face .
Simulated annealing algorithms use ‘heating’ and ‘cooling’ primitives to reduce the possibility of the optimization process to get becoming at local minima . Heat causes random moves to states of higher energies , whereas a slower cooling provides opportunities for finding configurations with lower energy . Each step of the SA algorithm moves to a random nearby solution , with a probability that depends on the difference of the objective function and the global temperature T , which gradually reduces .
Algorithm 1 Layout optimization with simulated annealing Require : G = ( V , E ) , p ∈ V Ensure : ∀v ∈ V : Pos(v ) ∈ R2
∀e ∈ E : CS(e ) ← TRUE T ← 1 // initial temperature while T > do CSnew ← CS for all e ∈ E do if Random[0 , 1 ] < T then
CSnew(e ) ← ¬ CS(e ) end if end for if EdgeCrossings(CSnew ) < EdgeCrossings(CS ) then
CS ← CSnew T ← T ∗ α else
T ← T /β end if end while
In our problem , we need to decide which of the two positions of the intersecting circles we will choose . Therefore , the decision state space is a binary vector of length N indicating which of the two intersection points to choose for all N edges of the spanning tree . The current state in the decision space is stored as a vector CS . The simulated annealing technique is performed on the vector CS , directing the bit state position towards values that minimize the intersection of the spanning tree edges . A pseudocode of this process is captured in Algorithm 1 . In each iteration , the modified state vector CSnew is evaluated by the layout algorithm and directed towards the state that will minimize the number of intersected edges . The function EdgeCrossings in the pseudocode evaluates the number of intersected edges . If the current solution results in a lower number of interested edges , the temperature is increased ( T ← T ∗ α ) , so that additional opportunities can be explored and local minima potentially avoided . Conversely , if the current state does not lead to a better solution , the global temperature is reduced ( T ← T /β ) , with the cooling off indicating that we may be drawing close to the global minimum .
In the experimental section , we show that the simulated annealing process results in a significantly smaller number of intersected edges on the 2D projected space .
C . Triangulation on Non metric Distances
The previous section presumed that the underlying distance measure obeys the triangle inequality , and therefore the circles around the reference points are guaranteed to intersect . However many widely utilized distance functions ( eg , dynamic time warping , longest common subsequence , earth mover ’s distance ) violate the triangle inequality and thus the corresponding reference circles may not necessarily intersect . We highlight necessary extensions that allow its proper usage under non metric distances . We can identify two cases for non intersecting circles : i ) The two circles are disjoint and not enclosed within one another , and ii ) one circle encloses the other .

Figure 4 . Circles that are disjoint
For each of these cases , we need to identify the position in which an object has to be placed with respect to the two circles so that the object is mapped as close as possible to the circumference of both circles . One can show the following :
Lemma 1 . Thepointthatminimizesthesumofdistancesto the perimeters of two circles lies on the line L connecting the two circle centers and is located midway on the line segmentwithverticesattheintersectionofL withthecircles’ perimeters .
Case 1 is shown in Figure 3 . The midpoint C is given by the equation :

MST mapped points , because the clustering order is the same as the order crystallized in the spanning tree mapping . This fact can be also seen in Figure 1 where the single linkage dendrogram is positioned exactly on top of the spanning tree mapping . cutting here will result in the left clusters

For case 2 , where a circle is enclosed within another , we can identify two sub cases :
When the two circles have disjoint centers as shown in Fig 5(a ) , then the coordinates of the sought point C that minimizes the distance to the two circles is also given by Equation 1 , where in this case c = 1 .
In the case when the two circles have common centers , then there exist two points per line that satisfy the distance minimization property as shown in Fig 5(b ) . There is an infinite number of such lines , all passing through the common center of the two circles . r1 + r2

The above modifications allow the positioning of the objects on the two dimensional plane , so that our mapping approach also accommodates the cases with non metric distance functions .
D . Cluster Preservation
In addition to neighborhood preservation , we also seek to accurately portray clustering information . Recall that the input for the algorithm is a matrix of pairwise distances . Based on the given pairwise distances , one can build a hierarchical dendrogram . The dendrogram construction is based on a single linkage approach that merges closest singleton objects and clusters . As the hierarchical cluster construction that we adopt updates the distances in such a way that minimum distances between objects are favored in the merging process , this allows us to effectively combine the two techniques .
Lemma 2 . Themergingorderofthemininumspanningtree ( MST ) algorithm is the same as the merging order of the singlelinkagehierarchicalclusteringapproach .
The above essentially tells us that we can achieve a perfect overlay of the constructed hierarchy on top of the cutting at a higher position of the dendrogram will result at merged clusters on the right
Figure 6 . Cluster information is conveyed by variable thresholds on a hierarchical cluster dendrogram information ( middle ) . By ‘cutting’ at different parts of the dendrogram we can ‘zoom in’ and ‘zoom out’ from the cluster structure .
The above observation combined with the hierarchical cluster information provides the user with the ability to have a multi granular cluster view on 2D by means of variable threshold positioning on the resulting dendrogram ; this allows a ‘tomographic view’ of the clusters and the interactive formation of incrementally larger or smaller cluster structures . The concept is illustrated in Figure 6 . By cutting the dendrogram at a lower threshold , 6 clusters are created on the left . By imposing a higher threshold , clusters are progressively merged as shown on the right side . Clusters can be conveyed on 2D either enclosed in a convex hull of the contained objects or through color . In our prototype implementation , we convey cluster information by properly coloring the node perimeter as well as the connected edges .
III . EXPERIMENTS
We evaluate how the simulated annealing layout algorithm reduces the number of edge intersections . We also highlight the ability of our algorithm to preserve the original object distances and provide a thorough comparison with the mapping provided by the popular ISOMAP algorithm [ 4 ] .
A . Simulated Annealing Layout Algorithm
We assess the quality of the node layout placement with and without the proposed simulated annealing ( SA ) layout algorithm . Recall that the SA algorithm uses an optimization function to properly place the mapped nodes , so as to minimize the number of edges crossed .

However , for small neighborhoods ( k = 20 ) , our approach results in an embedding that is only 3 % worse than ISOMAP .

We use a dataset consisting of 247 two dimensional contours of fish . A sample of this dataset is shown in Fig 8 . A Euclidean metric distance function is employed .
Figure 8 . Snapshot of two dimensional fish contours .
We consider each one of the objects as pivots and use the proposed method to visualize the relationship of the 20 nearest neighbors : with and without the simulated annealing layout placement . The SA algorithm significantly reduces the number of intersected edges , which lends a higher readability to the mapped objects and their edges . Naturally , the SA algorithm also entails additional computational expense , because of the increased number of iterations that it introduces . In Table I we report the average number of edge intersections and the number of iterations for the layout algorithm : with and without the annealing component . We note that both variations provide the same distance preservation with respect to the pivot and the MST distances . However , the SA implementation clearly enhances the visualization capacity of the mapping , by providing a more intelligent node placement .
B . Metric Distance Preservation
Using the same contour dataset of fish and the previous metric distance function , we compare the distance distortion introduced by the proposed technique and by ISOMAP . ISOMAP represents a method for performing a non linear mapping of N dimensional points , on a lower dimensionality d . It has attracted significant interest from the data mining and machine learning community due to its effectiveness and simplicity of implementation . The mapping performed by ISOMAP attempts to ‘unfold’ the data , when they lie on a high dimensional manifold . ISOMAP shares some commonalities with the approach presented in this work , because it achieves a geodesic distance preservation by computing spanning tree distances in the original space , and preserving them on the d dimensional space through a PCA like projection operation . However , the process of preserving , on average , all spanning tree distances eventually is also one of weak points for ISOMAP . The final projection , even though it reveals the overall data structure , eventually results in significant distortions of the original distances . Experiment : For each of the 247 fish contours , we extract the k = 20 , 50 , 100 nearest neighbors , as suggested by the distance function . For each object , we evaluate how close the projected distances are on 2D , compared with the original high dimensional ones . We identify three subsets of distances : a ) Distances of all objects to the pivot , b ) distances of neighboring spanning tree distances , and c ) all pairwise distances . We make the above distinction because our approach carefully preserves the first two distance types . ISOMAP requires one parameter as input : the neighborhood of each object . Selecting this parameter is not an easy task , because it is data dependent . Typically , low values that lead to a fully connected graph are preferable . For each experiment we set the neighborhood value to k/3 , since lower values led to disconnected graphs .
Our findings are reported in Figure 7 . Distance preser

Figure 9 . Left : Two dimensional mapping produced by our approach . Distances to the central object are perfectly preserved . Right : ISOMAP mapping of the original objects , which shows many distortions of the original distances . vation is calculated as the mean ratio of distances in the projected space over distances in the original space . Hence , numbers closer to one ( 1 ) indicate that the projected distance on two dimensions is closer to the original distance . The ratios r for the corresponding 247 graphs are sorted from lowest to highest values . The experiments indicate that both distances to the pivot object and the MST distances are exactly preserved using the proposed method ( Fig 7 , left and middle graph ) . ISOMAP does not perform as well , since it focuses on preserving all pairs of distances .
Finally , we evaluate the accuracy of our technique for preserving all pairwise object distances . In preserving the spanning tree distances , our approach essentially preserves the ‘backbone’ of the dataset structure . Therefore , the remaining distances do not generally deviate significantly from the original distances . This result is captured in the rightmost graph of Figure 7 . For a neighborhood of k = 20 our approach overestimates on average the distances by 10 % while ISOMAP overestimates them by 7 % . The biggest difference in pairwise distance preservation accuracy is observed for k = 100 where ISOMAP introduces an average distance underestimation of 10 % , whereas for our approach overestimates distances by approximately 24 % .
C . Non metric Distance Preservation
Now , we use an anthropological dataset comprising skull images from various extinct species . We extract the perimeter of each skull and use a non metric distance function that accommodates for rotation invariance and elastic variations [ 5 ] . We execute ISOMAP and our mapping on the resulting pairwise distance matrix . The distance preservation ratio for both techniques is given in Table II . The results are calculated by using as pivot successively all objects . The results attest to the ability of our method to accurately map non metric distance relationships . ISOMAP provides a projection of lower quality with respect to the original distances . Our approach provides a better mapping even in the case of all pairwise distances , in which the average distance preservation ratio is 1.039 ( a 3.9 % error is introduced ) with a standard deviation of 0156 The actual mapping for both techniques is provided in Figure 9 when using as pivot object the skull of the ‘Common Chimpanzee’ .
