Abstract‚ÄîMicrodata protection in statistical databases has recently become a major societal concern and has been intensively studied in recent years . Statistical Disclosure Control ( SDC ) is often applied to statistical databases before they are released for public use . Microaggregation for SDC is a family of methods to protect microdata from individual identification . SDC seeks to protect microdata in such a way that can be published and mined without providing any private information that can be linked to specific individuals . Microaggregation works by partitioning the microdata into groups of at least ùëò records and then replacing the records in each group with the centroid of the group . An optimal microaggregation method must minimize the information loss resulting from this replacement process . The challenge is how to minimize the information loss during the microaggregation process . This paper presents a pairwise systematic ( P S ) microaggregation method to minimize the information loss . The proposed technique simultaneously forms two distant groups at a time with the corresponding similar records together in a systematic way and then anonymized with the centroid of each group individually . The structure of P S problem is defined and investigated and an algorithm of the proposed problem is developed . The performance of the P S algorithm is compared against the most recent microaggregation methods . Experimental results show that P S algorithm incurs less than half information loss than the latest microaggregation methods for all of the test situations .

I . INTRODUCTION
In recent years , the phenomenal advance of technological developments in information technology enable government agencies and corporations to accumulate an enormous amount of personal data for analytical purposes . These agencies and organizations often need to release individual records ( microdata ) for research and other public benefit purposes . This propagation has to be in accordance with laws and regulations to avoid the propagation of confidential information . In other words , microdata should be published in such a way that preserve the privacy of the individuals . To protect personal data from individual identification , SDC is often applied before the data are released for analysis [ 2 ] , [ 25 ] . The purpose of microdata SDC is to alter the original microdata in such a way that the statistical analysis from the original data and the modified data are similar and the disclosure risk of identification is low . As SDC requires suppressing or altering the original data , the quality of data and the analysis results can be damaged . Hence , SDC methods must find a balance between data utility and personal confidentiality .
Microaggregation is a family of SDC methods for protecting microdata sets that have been extensively studied recently [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 11 ] , [ 19 ] , [ 21 ] . The basic idea of microaggregation is to partition a dataset into mutually exclusive groups of at least ùëò records prior to publication , and then publish the centroid over each group instead of individual records . The resulting anonymized dataset satisfies ùëòanonymity [ 17 ] , requiring each record in a dataset to be identical to at least ( ùëò‚àí 1 ) other records in the same dataset . As releasing microdata about individuals poses privacy threat due to the privacy related attributes , called quasi identifiers , both ùëò anonymity and microaggregation only consider the quasi identifiers . Microaggregation is traditionally restricted to numeric attributes in order to calculate the centroid of records , but also has been extended to handle categorical and ordinal attributes [ 4 ] , [ 7 ] , [ 18 ] . In this paper we propose a microaggregated method that is also applicable to numeric attributes . the anonymized dataset
The effectiveness of a microaggregation method is measured by calculating its information loss . A lower information loss implies that is less distorted from the original dataset , and thus provides better data quality for analysis . ùëò anonymity [ 16 ] , [ 17 ] , [ 20 ] , [ 24 ] provides sufficient protection of personal confidentiality of microdata , while ensuring the quality of the anonymized dataset , an effective microaggregation method should incur as little information loss as possible . In order to be useful in practice , the dataset should keep as much informative as possible . Hence , it is necessary to seriously consider the tradeoff between privacy and information loss . To minimize the information loss due to microaggregation , all records are partitioned into several groups such that each group contains at least ùëò similar records , and then the records in each group are replaced by their corresponding mean such that the values of each variable are the same . Such similar groups are known as clusters . In the context of data mining , clustering is a useful technique that partitions records into

266 groups such that records within a group are similar to each other , while records in different groups are most distinct from one another . Thus , microaggregation can be seen as a clustering problem with constraints on the size of the clusters .
Many microaggregation methods derive from traditional clustering algorithms . For example , Domingo Ferrer and Mateo Sanz [ 3 ] proposed univariate and multivariate ùëòWard algorithms that extend the agglomerative hierarchical clustering method of Ward et al . [ 22 ] . Domingo Ferrer and Torra [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] proposed a microaggregation method based on the fuzzy ùëê means algorithm [ 1 ] , and Laszlo and Mukherjee [ 12 ] extended the standard minimum spanning tree partitioning algorithm for microaggregation [ 26 ] . All of these microaggregation methods build all clusters gradually but simultaneously . There are some other methods for microaggregation that have been proposed in the literature that build one/two cluster(s ) at a time . Notable examples include Maximum Distance [ 14 ] , Diameter based Fixed Size microaggregation and centroid based Fixed size microaggregation [ 12 ] , Maximum Distance to Average Vector ( MDAV ) [ 7 ] , MHM [ 8 ] and the Two Fixed Reference Points method [ 27 ] . Most recently , Lin et al . [ 28 ] proposed a densitybased microaggregation method that forms records by the descending order of their densities , and then fine tunes these clusters in reverse order .
The reminder of this paper is organized as follows . We introduce a problem of microaggregation in Section II . Section III introduces the basic concept of microaggregation . Section IV reviews previous microaggregation methods . We present a brief description of our proposed microaggregation method in Section V . Section VI shows experimental results of the proposed method . Finally , concluding remarks are included in Section VII .
II . PROBLEM STATEMENT
The algorithms for microaggregation works by partitioning the microdata into groups , where within groups the records are homogeneous but between groups the records are heterogeneous so that information loss is low . The similar groups are also called clusters . The level of privacy required is controlled by a security parameter ùëò , the minimum number of records in a cluster . In essence , the parameter ùëò specifies the maximum acceptable disclosure risk . Once a value for ùëò has been selected by the data protector , the only job left is to maximize data utility . Maximizing utility can be achieved by microaggregating optimally , ie with minimum within groups variability loss . So the main challenge in microaggregation is how to minimize the information loss during the clustering process . Although plenty of work has been done , to maximize the data utility by forming the clusters , this is not yet sufficient in terms of information loss . So more research needs to be done to form the clusters such that the information loss is as low as possible . This paper analyses the problem with a new pairwise approach such that the information loss is minimal .
Observing this challenge , this work presents a new clustering based method for microaggregation , where two distant clusters are made simultaneously in a systematic way . According to this method , sort all records in ascending order by using a sorting function so that the first record and the last record are most distant to each other . Form a cluster with the first record and its ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records and another cluster with the last record and its ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records . Sort the remaining records ( (ùëõ ‚àí 2ùëò ) , if dataset contains ùëõ records ) by using the same sorting function and continue to build pair clusters at the same time by using the first and the last record as seeds until some specified records remain . Finally form one/two cluster(s ) depending on the remaining records . Thus all clusters produced in this way contain ùëò records except the last cluster that may contain at the most ( 2ùëò ‚àí 1 ) records . Performance of the proposed method is compared against the most recent widely used microaggregation methods . The experimental results show that the proposed microaggregation method outperforms the recent methods in the literature in all test situations .
III . BACKGROUND
Microdata protection through microaggregation has been intensively studied in recent years . Many techniques and methods have been proposed to deal with this problem . In this section we describe some fundamental concepts of microaggregation .
When we microaggregate data we should keep in mind two goals : data utility and preserving privacy of individuals . For preserving the data utility we should introduce as little noise as possible into the data and preserving privacy data should be sufficiently modified in such a way that it is difficult for an adversary to reidentify the corresponding individuals . Figure 1 shows an example of microaggregated data where the individuals in each cluster are replaced by the corresponding cluster mean . The figure shows that after aggregating the chosen elements , it is impossible to distinguish them , so that the probability of linking any respondent is inversely proportional to the number of aggregated elements . Consider a microdata set ùëá with ùëù numeric attributes and ùëõ records , where each record is represented as a vector in a ùëù dimensional space . For a given positive integer ùëò ‚â§ ùëõ , a microaggregation method partitions ùëá into ùëî clusters , where each cluster contains at least ùëò records ( to satisfy ùëòanonymity ) , and then replaces the records in each cluster with the centroid of the cluster . Let ùëõùëñ denote the number of records in the ùëñth cluster , and ùë•ùëñùëó , 1 ‚â§ ùëó ‚â§ ùëõùëñ , denote the ùëóth record in the ùëñth cluster . Then , ùëõùëñ ‚â• ùëò for ùëñ = 1 to ùëî , ùëñ=1 ùëõùëñ = ùëõ . The centroid of the ùëñth cluster , denoted and by ¬Øùë•ùëñ is calculated as the average vector of all the records in the ùëñth cluster .

Definition 1 ( Microaggregation problem ) Given a dataset ùëá of ùëõ elements and a positive integer ùëò , find a partitioning ùëÆ = {ùê∫1 , ùê∫2 , , ùê∫ùëî} of ùëá such that
ùëñ=1ùê∫ùëñ = ùëá ,

The microaggregation problem stated above can be solved in polynomial time for a univariate dataset [ 11 ] but has been shown to be NP hard for multivariate dataset [ 13 ] . It is a natural expectation that ùëÜùëÜùê∏ is low if the number of clusters is large . Thus the number of records in each cluster should be kept close to ùëò . Domingo Ferrer and Mateo Sanz [ 3 ] showed that no cluster should contain more than ( 2ùëò ‚àí 1 ) records since such clusters can always be partitioned to further reduce information loss .
IV . PREVIOUS MICROAGGREGATION METHODS
Previous microaggregation methods have been roughly divided into two categories , namely fixed size and dataoriented microaggregation [ 3 ] , [ 8 ] . For fixed size microaggregation , the partition is done by dividing a dataset into clusters that have size ùëò , except perhaps one cluster which has a size between ùëò and ( 2ùëò ‚àí 1 ) , depending on the total number of records ùëõ and the anonymity parameter ùëò . For the data oriented microaggregation , the partition is done by allowing all clusters with sizes between ùëò and ( 2ùëò ‚àí 1 ) . Intuitively , fixed size methods reduce the search space , and thus are more computationally efficient than data oriented methods [ 28 ] . However , data oriented methods can adapt to different values of ùëò and various data distributions and thus may achieve lower information loss than fixed size methods . Domingo Ferrer and Mateo Sanz [ 3 ] proposed a multivariate fixed size microaggregation method , later called the Maximum Distance ( MD ) method [ 14 ] . The MD method repeatedly locates the two records that are most distant to each other , and forms two clusters with their respective ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records until fewer than 2ùëò records remain . If at least ùëò records remain , it then forms a new cluster with all remaining records . Finally when there are fewer than ùëò records not assigned to any cluster yet , this algorithm then individually assigns these records to their closest clusters . This method has a time complexity of ùëÇ(ùëõ3 ) and works well for most datasets . Laszlo and Mukherjee [ 12 ] modified the last step of the MD method such that each remaining record is added to its own nearest cluster and proposed Diameterbased Fixed size microaggregation . This method is however not a fixed size method because it allows more than one cluster to have more than ùëò records .
The MDAV method is the most widely used microaggregation method [ 14 ] . MDAV is the same as MD except in
Figure 1 . Example of Microaggregation using mean
In the same way , the centroid of ùëá , denoted by ¬Øùë• , is the average vector of all the records in ùëá . Information loss is used to quantify the amount of information of a dataset that is lost after applying a microaggregation method . In this paper we use the most common definition of information loss by Domingo Ferrer and Mateo Sanz [ 3 ] as follows :
ùêºùêø =
ùëÜùëÜùê∏ ùëÜùëÜùëá
( 1 ) where ùëÜùëÜùê∏ is the within cluster squared error , calculated by summing the Euclidean distance of each record ùë•ùëñùëó to the average value ¬Øùë•ùëñ as follows :
ùëî‚àë
ùëõùëñ‚àë

ùëÜùëÜùê∏ =
( 2 )
ùëñ=1
ùëó=1 and ùëÜùëÜùëá is the sum of squared error within the entire dataset ùëá , calculated by summing the Euclidean distance of each record ùë•ùëñùëó to the average value ¬Øùë• as follows : ( ùë•ùëñùëó ‚àí ¬Øùë• )
( ùë•ùëñùëó ‚àí ¬Øùë• )

For a given dataset ùëá , ùëÜùëÜùëá is fixed regardless of how ùëá is partitioned . On the other hand , SSE varies of a dataset depending on the partition of the dataset . In essence , SSE measures the similarity of the records in a cluster . The lower the SSE , the higher the within cluster homogeneity and the higher the SSE , the lower the within cluster homogeneity . If all the records in a cluster are the same , then the SSE is zero indicating no information is lost . On the other hand , if all the records in a cluster are more diverse , SSE is large indicating more information is lost . In this paper , we used SSE as a measure of similarity indicating a record will be included in a particular cluster if it causes least SSE among all other records in the dataset . Therefore , the microaggregation problem can be enumerated as a
268 the first step . MDAV finds the record ùëü that is furthest from the current centroid of the dataset and the record ùë† that is furthest from ùëü instead of finding the two records that are most distant to each other , as is done in MD . Then form a cluster with ùëü and its ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records and form another cluster with ùë† and its ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records . For the remaining records , repeat this process until fewer than 2ùëò records remain . If between ùëò and ( 2ùëò‚àí1 ) records remain , MDAV simply forms a new group with all of the remaining records . On the other hand , if the number of the remaining records is below ùëò , it adds all of the remaining records to their nearest clusters . So MDAV is a fixed size method . Lin et al . [ 28 ] proposed a modified MDAV , called MDAV 1 . The MDAV 1 is similar to MDAV except when the number of the remaining records is between ùëò and ( 2ùëò ‚àí 1 ) , a new cluster is formed with the record that is the furthest from the centroid of the remaining records , and its ( ùëò‚àí 1 ) nearest records . Any remaining records are then added to their respective nearest clusters . Experimental results indicate that MDAV 1 incurs slightly less information loss than MDAV [ 28 ] . Another variant of the MDAV method , called MDAVgeneric , is proposed by Domingo Ferrer and Torra [ 7 ] , where by the threshold 2ùëò is altered to 3ùëò . If between 2ùëò and ( 3ùëò ‚àí 1 ) records remain , then find the record ùëü that is furthest from the centroid of the remaining records and form a cluster with ùëü and its ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records and another cluster with the remaining records . Finally when fewer than 2ùëò records remain , this algorithm then forms a new cluster with all the remaining records . Laszlo and Mukherjee [ 12 ] proposed another method , called Centroid based Fixed size microaggregation that is also based on a centroid but builds only one cluster during each iteration . This algorithm first find a record ùëü that is furthest from the current centroid of the dataset and then find a cluster with ùëü and its ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records . For the remaining records repeat the same process until fewer than ùëò records remain . Finally add each remaining record to its nearest clusters . This method is not a fixed size method as more than one cluster has more than ùëò records . Solanas et al . [ 15 ] proposed a variable size variant of MDAV , called V MDAV . V MDAV first builds a new cluster of ùëò records and then tries to extend this to up to ( 2ùëò ‚àí 1)records based on some criteria . V MDAV adopts a user defined parameter to control the threshold of adding more records to a cluster . Chang et al . [ 27 ] proposed the Two Fixed Reference Points ( TFRP ) method to accelerate the clustering process of ùëò anonymization . During the first phase , TFRP selects two extreme points calculated from the dataset . Let ùëÅùëöùëñùëõ and ùëÅùëöùëéùë• be the minimum and maximum values over all attributes in the datasets , respectively , then one reference point ùê∫1 has ùëÅùëöùëñùëõ as its value for all attributes , and another reference point ùê∫2 has ùëÅùëöùëéùë• as its value for all attributes . A cluster of ùëò records is then formed with the record ùëü that is the furthest from ùê∫1 and the ( ùëò‚àí1 ) nearest records to ùëü . Similarly another cluster of ùëò records is formed with the record ùë† that is the furthest from ùê∫2 and ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records to ùë† . These two steps are repeated until fewer than ùëò records remain . Finally , these remaining records are assigned to their respective nearest clusters . This method is quite efficient as ùê∫1 and ùê∫2 are fixed throughout the iterations . When all clusters are generated , TFRP applies a enhancement step to determine whether a cluster should be retained or decomposed and added to other clusters .
Lin et al . [ 28 ] proposed a density based algorithm ( DBA ) for microaggregation . The DBA has two different scenarios . The first state of DBA ( DBA 1 ) repeatedly builds a new cluster using the ùëò neighborhood of the record with the highest ùëò density among all records that are not yet assigned to any cluster until fewer than ùëò unassigned records remain . These remaining records are then assigned to their respective nearest clusters . The DBA 1 partitions the dataset into some clusters , where each cluster contains no fewer than ùëò records . The second state of DBA ( DBA 2 ) attempts to fine tune all clusters by checking whether to decompose a cluster and merge its content with other clusters . Notably , all clusters are checked during the DBA 2 by the reverse of the order that they were added to clusters in the DBA 1 . After several clusters are removed and their records are added to their nearest clusters in the DBA 2 , some clusters may contain more than ( 2ùëò ‚àí 1 ) records . At the end of the DBA 2 , the MDAV 1 algorithm is applied to each cluster with size above ( 2ùëò ‚àí 1 ) to reduce the information loss . This state is finally called MDAV 2 . Experimental results show that the DBA attains a reasonable dominance over the latest microaggregation methods .
All of the microaggregation methods described above repeatedly choose one/ two records according to various heuristics and form one/two cluster(s ) with the chosen records and their respective ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) other records . However there are other microaggregation methods that build all clusters simultaneously and work by initially forming multiple clusters of records in the form of trees , where each tree represent a cluster . The multivariate ùëò Ward algorithm [ 3 ] first finds the two records that are furthest from each other in the dataset and build two clusters from these two records and their respective ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records . Each of the remaining record then forms its own cluster . These clusters are repeatedly merged until all clusters have at least ùëò records . Finally the algorithm is recursively applied to each cluster containing 2ùëò or more records . Domingo Ferrer et al . [ 9 ] proposed a multivariate microaggregation method called ùúá Approx . This method first builds a forest and then decomposes the trees in the forest such that all trees have sizes between ùëò and max(2ùëò ‚àí 1 , 3ùëò ‚àí 5 ) . Finally , for any tree with size greater than ( 2ùëò‚àí 1 ) , find the node in the tree that is furthest from the centroid of the tree . Form a cluster with this node and its ( ùëò‚àí 1 ) nearest records in the tree and form another cluster with the remaining records in the tree . Hansen an Mukherjee [ 11 ] proposed a microaggrega
269 tion method for univariate datasets called HM . After that Domingo Ferrer et al . [ 8 ] proposed a multivariate version of the HM method , called MHM . This method first uses various heuristics , such as nearest point next ( NPN ) , maximum distance ( MD ) or MDAV to order the multivariate records . Steps similar to the HM method are then applied to generate clusters based on this ordering . Domingo Ferrer et al . [ 6 ] proposed a microaggregation method based on fuzzy ùëêmeans algorithm ( FCM ) [ 1 ] . This method repeatedly runs FCM to adjust the two parameters of FCM ( one is the number of clusters ùëê and another is the exponent for the partition matrix ùëö ) until each cluster contains at least ùëò records . The value of ùëê is initially large ( and ùëö is small ) and is gradually reduced ( increased ) during the repeated FCM runs to reduce the size of each cluster . The same process is then recursively applied to those clusters with 2ùëò or more records .
V . THE PROPOSED APPROACH
This section presents the proposed pairwise systematic algorithm for microaggregation that minimizes the information loss and satisfies the ùëò anonymity requirement . The proposed approach builds and refines simultaneously two distant clusters at a time with the corresponding similar records together in a systematic way .
A . Sorting Function
According to the proposed approach , first sort all records with respect to the attributes , so it is necessary to define a sorting function to sort all the records in the dataset . Consider a microdata set ùëá with ùëù numeric attributes , namely ùëå1 , ùëå2 , , ùëåùëù and ùëõ records . Thus each record is represented as a vector in a ùëù dimensional space . To sort all the records with respect to the numeric attributes , we define the ùëóth sorted record in the dataset ùëá as follows :
ùëÜùêπùëó =
ùëù‚àë
ùëñ=1
( ùë¶ùëñùëó ‚àí ¬Øùë¶ùëñ ) ,
ùëó = 1 , 2 , ùëõ .
( 4 ) where , ùë¶ùëñùëó is the ùëóth record of the ùëñth attribute and ¬Øùë¶ùëñ is the centroid of the ùëñth attribute . The SF stated above measures the distance between the records and their corresponding centroid . In this study , the SF is arranged in ascending order indicating records are arranged in order of magnitude . The lower the values of SF , the more the records are below their respective centroid and the higher the values of SF , the more the records are above their respective centroid . Thus the records in the dataset ùëá , sorted in ascending order based on the SF and the first and the last record , are most distant among all other records in the dataset ùëá .
B . Pairwise Systematic microaggregation algorithm
Based on the information loss measure in equation ( 1 ) and the definition of the microaggregation problem , we are now ready to discuss the Pairwise Systematic ( P S ) microaggregation algorithm .
According to this method , first sort all records of ùëõ in the dataset ùëá in ascending order by using the SF in equation ( 4 ) . Thus in the sorting dataset , the first record and the last record are the most distant to each other among all other pair records in the dataset ùëá . The algorithm ( see Fig 2 ) repeatedly builds pair clusters using the first record and the last record in the sorting dataset and their corresponding ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records until fewer than 3ùëò records remain ( see steps 2 6 of Fig 2 ) . The nearest records in a cluster are chosen in such a way that the inclusion of these records causes less SSE than the other records in the dataset . If between 2ùëò and ( 3ùëò‚àí1 ) records remain , then sort these records in ascending order by using the same sorting function in equation ( 4 ) and find the first record ùëì . Form a cluster with ùëì and its ( ùëò ‚àí 1 ) nearest records , and another cluster with the remaining records ( see step 7 of Fig 2 ) . Moreover , if fewer than 2ùëò records remain , then form a new cluster with all remaining records ( see step 9 of Fig 2 ) .
The P S microaggregation algorithm stated above endeavor to repeatedly build two clusters simmultaneously in a systematic way . As the records in the dataset ùëá are arranged in ascending order and the first record and the last record are most distant to each other , building clusters in this systematic way , the algorithm easily captures if there are any extreme values in the dataset .
Definition 2 ( Systematic clustering based microaggregation decision problem ) In a given dataset ùëá of ùëõ records , there is a clustering scheme ùëÆ = {ùê∫1 , ùê∫2 , , ùê∫ùëî} such that 1 ) ‚à£ ùê∫ùëñ ‚à£‚â• ùëò , 1 < ùëò ‚â§ ùëõ : the size of each cluster is
2 ) greater than or equal to a positive integer ùëò , and ‚àëùëî ùëñ=1 ùêºùêø(ùê∫ùëñ ) < ùëê , ùëê > 0 : the total information loss of the clustering scheme is less than a positive integer c . where each cluster ùê∫ùëñ(ùëñ = 1 , 2 , , ùëù ) contains the records that are more similar to each other such that the cluster means are close to the values of the clusters and thus cause the least information loss .
VI . EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
The objective of our experiment is to investigate the recital of our approach in terms of data quality . This section experimentally evaluates the P S microaggregation algorithm . The following three datasets [ 8 ] , which have been used as benchmarks in previous studies to evaluate various microaggregation methods , were adopted in our experiments . the effectiveness of

3 ) The ‚Äú EIA ‚Äù dataset contains 4,092 records with 11 numeric attributes ( plus two additional categorical attributes not used here ) .
To accurately evaluate our approach , the performance of the proposed P S microaggregation algorithm is compared in this section with various microaggregation methods . Tables I III show the information losses of these microaggregation methods . The lowest information loss for each dataset and each ùëò value is shown in bold face . The information losses of methods DBA 1 , DBA 2 , MDAV 1 and MDAV 2 are quoted from [ 28 ] ; the information losses of methods MDAVMHM , MD MHM , CBFS MHM , NPN MHM and M d ( for ùëò = 3 , 5 , 10 ) are quoted from [ 8 ] ; the information losses of methods ùúá Approx and M d ( for ùëò = 4 ) are quoted from [ 9 ] , and the information losses of methods TFRP 1 and TFRP 2 are quoted from [ 27 ] . TFRP is a two stage method and its two stages are denoted as TRFP 1 and TRFP 2 respectively . The TFRP 2 is similar to the DBA 2 but disallows merging a record to a group of size over ( 4ùëò ‚àí 1 ) .
Tables I III show the information loss for several values of ùëò and the Tarragona , Census and for the EIA datasets respectively . The information loss is compared with the P S microaggregation algorithm among the latest microaggregation methods listed above . Information loss is measured as √ó100 , where SST is the total sum of the squares of SSE SST the dataset . Note that the within groups sum of squares SSE is never greater than SST so that the reported information loss measure takes values in the range [ 0,100 ] . Tables I III illustrate that in all of the test situations , the P S microaggregation algorithm causes significantly less information loss than any of the microaggregation methods listed in the table . Essentially , the P S microaggregation algorithm causes less than 50 % information loss compared to any of the previous methods listed above and for any of the datasets . This shows the utility and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .
VII . CONCLUSION
Microaggregation is an effective method in SDC of protecting privacy in microdata and has been extensively used world wide . The level of privacy required is controlled by a parameter ùëò , often called anonymity parameter for ùëòanonymization that is basically the minimum number of records in a cluster . Once the value of ùëò has been chosen , the data protector and the data users are interested in minimizing the information loss . This work has presented a new Pairwise Systematic ( P S ) microaggregation method for numerical attributes . The new method consists of pairwise clustering individual records in microdata in a number of disjointed clusters in a systematic way , using a sorting function prior publication and then publishing the mean over each cluster instead of individual records . A comparison has been made of the proposed algorithm with the most widely used microaggregation methods through experimenting with the three benchmark datasets ( Tarragona , Census and the EIA ) . The experimental results show that the proposed
