Abstract—Clustering validation has long been recognized as one of the vital issues essential to the success of clustering applications . In general , clustering validation can be categorized into two classes , external clustering validation and internal clustering validation . In this paper , we focus on internal clustering validation and present a detailed study of 11 widely used internal clustering validation measures for crisp clustering . From five conventional aspects of clustering , we investigate their validation properties . Experiment results show that 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 is the only internal validation measure which performs well in all five aspects , while other measures have certain limitations in different application scenarios .
I . INTRODUCTION
Clustering , one of the most important unsupervised learning problems , is the task of dividing a set of objects into clusters such that objects within the same cluster are similar while objects in different clusters are distinct . Clustering is widely used in many fields , such as image analysis and bioinformatics . As an unsupervised learning task , it is necessary to find a way to validate the goodness of partitions after clustering . Otherwise , it would be difficult to make use of different clustering results .
Clustering validation , which evaluates the goodness of clustering results [ 1 ] , has long been recognized as one of the vital issues essential to the success of clustering applications [ 2 ] . External clustering validation and internal clustering validation are the two main categories of clustering validation . The main difference is whether or not external information is used for clustering validation . An example of external validation measure is entropy , which evaluates the “ purity ” of clusters based on the given class labels [ 3 ] .
Unlike external validation measures , which use external information not present in the data , internal validation measures only rely on information in the data . The internal measures evaluate the goodness of a clustering structure without respect to external information [ 4 ] . Since external validation measures know the “ true ” cluster number in advance , they are mainly used for choosing an optimal clustering algorithm on a specific data set . On the other hand , internal validation measures can be used to choose the best clustering algorithm as well as the optimal cluster number without any additional information . In practice , external information such as class labels is often not available in many application scenarios . Therefore , in the situation that there is no external information available , internal validation measures are the only option for cluster validation .
In literature , a number of internal clustering validation measures for crisp clustering have been proposed , such as 𝐶𝐻 , 𝐼 , 𝐷𝐵 , 𝑆𝐷 and 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 . However , current existing measures can be affected by various data characteristics . For example , noise in data can have a significant impact on the performance of an internal validation measure , if minimum or maximum pairwise distances are used in the measure . The performance of existing measures in different situations remains unknown . Therefore , we present a detailed study of 11 widely used internal validation measures , as shown in Table I . We investigate their validation properties in five different aspects : monotonicity , noise , density , subclusters and skewed distributions . For each aspect , we generate synthetic data for experiments . These synthetic data well represent the properties . Finally , the experiment results show that 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 is the only internal validation measure which performs well in all five aspects , while other measures have certain limitations in different application scenarios , mainly in aspects of noise and subclusters .
II . INTERNAL CLUSTERING VALIDATION MEASURES
In this section , we introduce some basic concepts of internal validation measures , as well as a suite of 11 widely used internal validation indices .
As the goal of clustering is to make objects within the same cluster similar and objects in different clusters distinct , internal validation measures are often based on the following two criteria [ 4 ] [ 5 ] .
I . Compactness . It measures how closely related the objects in a cluster are . A group of measures evaluate cluster compactness based on variance . Lower variance indicates better compactness . Also , there are numerous measures estimate the cluster compactness based on distance , such as maximum or average pairwise distance , and maximum or average center based distance .

II . Separation . It measures how distinct or well separated a cluster is from other clusters . For example , the pairwise distances between cluster centers or the pairwise minimum distances between objects in different clusters are widely used as measures of separation . Also , measures based on density are used in some indices .
The general procedure to determine the best partition and optimal cluster number of a set of objects by using internal validation measures is as follows .
Step 1 : Initialize a list of clustering algorithms which will be applied to the data set .
Step 2 : For each clustering algorithm , use different com binations of parameters to get different clustering results .
Step 3 : Compute the corresponding internal validation index of each partition obtained in step 2 .
Step 4 : Choose the best partition and the optimal cluster number according to the criteria .
Table I shows a suite of 11 widely used internal validation measures . To the best of our knowledge , these measures represent a good coverage of the validation measures available in different fields , such as data mining , information retrieval , and machine learning . The “ Definition ” column gives the computation forms of the measures . Next , we briefly introduce these measures .
Most indices consider both of the evaluation criteria ( compactness and separation ) in the way of ratio or summation , such as 𝐷𝐵 , 𝑋𝐵 , and 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 . On the other hand , some indices only consider one aspect , such as 𝑅𝑀 𝑆𝑆𝑇 𝐷 , 𝑅𝑆 , and Γ .
The Root mean square standard deviation ( 𝑅𝑀 𝑆𝑆𝑇 𝐷 ) is the square root of the pooled sample variance of all the attributes [ 6 ] . It measures the homogeneity of the formed clusters . R squared ( 𝑅𝑆 ) is the ratio of sum of squares between clusters to the total sum of squares of the whole data set . It measures the degree of difference between clusters [ 6 ]
[ 7 ] . The Modified Hubert Γ statistic ( Γ ) [ 8 ] evaluates the difference between clusters by counting the disagreements of pairs of data objects in two partitions .
The Calinski Harabasz index ( 𝐶𝐻 ) [ 9 ] evaluates the cluster validity based on the average between and withincluster sum of squares . Index 𝐼 ( 𝐼 ) [ 1 ] measures separation based on the maximum distance between cluster centers , and measures compactness based on the sum of distances between objects and their cluster center . Dunn ’s index ( 𝐷 ) [ 10 ] uses the minimum pairwise distance between objects in different clusters as the inter cluster separation and the maximum diameter among all clusters as the intracluster compactness . These three indices take a form of 𝐼𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 = ( 𝑎⋅ 𝑆𝑒𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛)/(𝑏⋅ 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑛𝑒𝑠𝑠 ) , where 𝑎 and 𝑏 are weights . The optimal cluster number is determined by maximizing the value of these indices .
The Silhouette index ( 𝑆 ) [ 11 ] validates the clustering performance based on the pairwise difference of betweenand within cluster distances . In addition , the optimal cluster number is determined by maximizing the value of this index . The Davies Bouldin index ( 𝐷𝐵 ) [ 12 ] is calculated as follows . For each cluster 𝐶 , the similarities between 𝐶 and all other clusters are computed , and the highest value is assigned to 𝐶 as its cluster similarity . Then the 𝐷𝐵 index can be obtained by averaging all the cluster similarities . The smaller the index is , the better the clustering result is . By minimizing this index , clusters are the most distinct from each other , and therefore achieves the best partition . index ( 𝑋𝐵 ) [ 13 ] defines the inter cluster The Xie Beni separation as the minimum square distance between cluster centers , and the intra cluster compactness as the mean square distance between each data object and its cluster center . The optimal cluster number is reached when the minimum of 𝑋𝐵 is found . Kim et al . [ 14 ] proposed indices 𝐷𝐵∗∗ and

𝑋𝐵∗∗ In this paper , we will use these two improved measures . in year 2005 as the improvements of 𝐷𝐵 and 𝑋𝐵 .
The idea of SD index ( 𝑆𝐷 ) [ 15 ] is based on the concepts of the average scattering and the total separation of clusters . The first term evaluates compactness based on variances of cluster objects , and the second term evaluates separation difference based on distances between cluster centers . The value of this index is the summation of these two terms , and the optimal number of clusters can be obtained by minimizing the value of 𝑆𝐷 .
The S Dbw index ( 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 ) [ 16 ] takes density into account to measure the inter cluster separation . The basic idea is that for each pair of cluster centers , at least one of their densities should be larger than the density of their midpoint . The intra cluster compactness is the same as it is in 𝑆𝐷 . Similarly , the index is the summation of these two terms and the minimum value of 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 indicates the optimal cluster number .
There are some other internal validation measures in literature [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] . However , some have poor performance while some are designed for data sets with specific structures . Take Composed Density between and within clusters index ( 𝐶𝐷𝑏𝑤 ) and Symmetry distance based index ( 𝑆𝑦𝑚–𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 ) for examples . It is hard for 𝐶𝐷𝑏𝑤 to find the representatives for each cluster , which makes the result of 𝐶𝐷𝑏𝑤 instable . Also 𝑆𝑦𝑚–𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑒𝑥 can only handle data sets which are internally symmetrical . As a result , we focus on the above mentioned 11 internal validation measures in the rest of the paper . And throughout this paper , we will use the acronyms of these measures .
III . UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CLUSTERING
VALIDATION MEASURES
In this section , we present a detailed study of the 11 internal validation measures mentioned in Section II and investigate the validation properties of different internal validation measures in different aspects , which may be helpful for index selection . If not mentioned , we use Kmeans [ 21 ] ( implemented by CLUTO ) [ 22 ] as the clustering algorithm for experiment .
A . The Impact of Monotonicity
The monotonicity of different internal validation indices can be evaluated by the following experiment . We apply the K means algorithm on the data set Wellseparated and get the clustering results for different number of clusters . As shown in Figure 1 , Wellseparated is a synthetic data set composed of five well separated clusters .
As the experiment results shown in Table II , the first three indices monotonically increases or decreases as the cluster number 𝑁 𝐶 increases . On the other hand , the rest eight indices reach their maximum or minimum value as 𝑁 𝐶 equals to the true cluster number . There are certain reasons for the monotonicity of the first three indices .
Figure 1 . The Data Set Wellseparated
√
𝑅𝑀 𝑆𝑆𝑇 𝐷 =
𝑆𝑆𝐸/𝑃 ( 𝑛 − 𝑁 𝐶 ) , and 𝑆𝑆𝐸 ( Sum of Square Error ) decreases as 𝑁 𝐶 increases . In practice 𝑁 𝐶 ≪ 𝑛 , thus 𝑛−𝑁 𝐶 can be viewed as a constant number . Therefore , 𝑅𝑀 𝑆𝑆𝑇 𝐷 decreases as 𝑁 𝐶 increases . And we also have 𝑅𝑆 = ( 𝑇 𝑆𝑆 − 𝑆𝑆𝐸)/𝑇 𝑆𝑆 ( 𝑇 𝑆𝑆 Total Sum of Squares ) , and 𝑇 𝑆𝑆 = 𝑆𝑆𝐸 + 𝑆𝑆𝐵 ( 𝑆𝑆𝐵 Between group Sum of Squares ) which is a constant number for a certain data set . Thus , 𝑅𝑆 increases as 𝑁 𝐶 increases .
From the definition of Γ , only data objects in different clusters will be counted in the equation . Therefore , if the data set is divided into two equal clusters , each cluster will have 𝑛/2 objects , and 𝑛2/4 pairs of distances will be counted actually . If the data set is divided into three equal clusters , each cluster will have 𝑛/3 objects , and 𝑛2/3 pairs of distances will be counted . Therefore , with the increasing of the cluster number 𝑁 𝐶 , more pairs of distances are counted , which makes Γ increase .
Looking further into these three indices , we can find out that they only take either separation or compactness into account . ( 𝑅𝑆 and Γ only consider separation , and 𝑅𝑀 𝑆𝑆𝑇 𝐷 only considers compactness ) . As the property of monotonicity , the curves of 𝑅𝑀 𝑆𝑆𝑇 𝐷 , 𝑅𝑆 and Γ will be either upward or downward . It is claimed that the optimal cluster number is reached at the shift point of the curves ,
913 which is also known as “ the elbow ” [ 7 ] . However , since the judgement of the shift point is very subjective and hard to determine , we will not discuss these three indices in the further sections .
B . The Impact of Noise
In order to evaluate the influence of noise on internal validation indices , we have the following experiment on the data set Wellseparatednoise As shown in Figure 2 , Wellseparated.noise is a synthetic data set formulated by adding 5 % noise to the data set Wellseparated . The cluster numbers select by indices are shown in Table III . The experiment results show that 𝐷 and 𝐶𝐻 choose the wrong cluster number . From our point of view , there are certain reasons that 𝐷 and 𝐶𝐻 are significantly affected by noise .
Moreover , influence of noise , which makes the value of 𝐶𝐻 instable . Finally , the optimal cluster number will be affected by noise . the other indices rather than 𝐶𝐻 and 𝐷 will also be influenced by noise in a less sensitive way . Comparing Table III with Table II , we can observe that the values of other indices more or less change . If we add 20 % noise to the data set Wellseparated , the optimal cluster number suggested by 𝐼 will also be incorrect . Thus , in order to minimize the adverse effect of noise , in practice it is always good to remove noise before clustering .
C . The Impact of Density
Data set with various density is challenging for many clustering algorithms . Therefore , we are very interested in whether it also affects the performance of the internal validation measures . An experiment is done on a synthetic data set with different density , which names Differentdensity . The results listed in Table IV show that only 𝑆 suggests the wrong optimal cluster number . The details of Differentdensity is shown in Figure 3 .

𝐷 uses the minimum pairwise distance between objects in different clusters ( 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑥∈𝐶𝑖,𝑦∈𝐶𝑗 𝑑(𝑥 , 𝑦 ) ) as the inter cluster separation , and the maximum diameter among all clusters ( max𝑘{max𝑥,𝑦∈𝐶𝑘 𝑑(𝑥 , 𝑦)} ) as the intra cluster compactness . And the optimal number of clusters can be obtained by maximizing the value of 𝐷 . When noise are introduced , the inter cluster separation can decrease sharply since it only uses the minimum pairwise distance , rather than the average pairwise distance , between objects in different clusters . Thus , the value of 𝐷 may change dramatically and the corresponding optimal cluster number will be influenced by the noise . Since 𝐶𝐻 = ( 𝑆𝑆𝐵/𝑆𝑆𝐸)⋅ ( (𝑛 − 𝑁 𝐶)/(𝑁 𝐶 − 1) ) , and ( (𝑛−𝑁 𝐶)/(𝑁 𝐶−1 ) ) is constant for the same 𝑁 𝐶 , we can just focus on the ( 𝑆𝑆𝐵/𝑆𝑆𝐸 ) part . By introducing noise , 𝑆𝑆𝐸 increases in a more significant way comparing with 𝑆𝑆𝐵 . Therefore , for the same 𝑁 𝐶 , 𝐶𝐻 will decrease by the

The reason why 𝐼 does not give the right cluster number is not easy to tell . We can observe that 𝐼 keeps decreasing as cluster number 𝑁 𝐶 increases . One possible reason by our guess is the uniform effect of K means algorithm , which tends to divide objects into relatively equal sizes [ 23 ] . 𝐼 measures compactness based on the sum of distances between objects and their cluster center . When 𝑁 𝐶 is small , objects with high density are likely in the same cluster , which makes the sum of distances almost remain the same . Since most of the objects are in one cluster , the total sum will not change too much . Therefore , as 𝑁 𝐶 increases , 𝐼 will decrease as 𝑁 𝐶 is in the denominator .

D . The Impact of Subclusters
Subclusters are clusters that are closed to each other . Figure 4 shows a synthetic data set Subcluster which contains five clusters , and four of them are subclusters since they can form two pairs of clusters respectively .
The experiment results presented in Table V evaluate whether the internal validation measures can handle data set with subclusters . For the data set Subcluster , 𝐷 , 𝑆 , 𝐷𝐵∗∗ , 𝑆𝐷 and 𝑋𝐵∗∗ get the wrong optimal cluster numbers , while 𝐼 , 𝐶𝐻 and 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 suggest the correct ones . Intercluster separation is supposed to have a sharp decrease when cluster number changes from 𝑁 𝐶𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 to 𝑁 𝐶𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙+1 [ 14 ] . However , for 𝐷 , 𝑆 , 𝐷𝐵∗∗ , sharper deceases can be observed at 𝑁 𝐶 < 𝑁 𝐶𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑎𝑙 . The reasons are as follows .
, 𝑆𝐷 and 𝑋𝐵∗∗ with skewed distributions . It consists of one large cluster and two small ones . Since K means has the uniform effect which tends to divide objects into relatively equal sizes , it does not have a good performance when dealing with skewed distributed data sets [ 23 ] . In order to demonstrate this statement , we employ four widely used algorithms from four different categories : K means ( prototype based ) , DBSCAN ( density based ) [ 24 ] , Agglo based on averagelink ( hierarchical ) [ 2 ] and Chameleon ( graph based ) [ 25 ] . We apply each of them on Skewdistribution and divide the data set into three clusters , since three is the true cluster number . As shown in Figure 6 , K means performs the worst while Chameleon is the best .

𝑆 uses the average minimum distance between clusters as the inter cluster separation . For data set with subclusters , the inter cluster separation will achieve its maximum value when subclusters close to each other are considered as one big cluster . Therefore , the wrong optimal cluster number will be chosen due to subclusters . 𝑋𝐵∗∗ uses the minimum pairwise distance between cluster centers as the evaluation of separation . For data set with subclusters , the measure of separation will achieve its maximum value when subclusters closed to each other are considered as a big cluster . As a result , the correct cluster number will not be found by using 𝑋𝐵∗∗ are very similar to the reason of 𝑋𝐵∗∗ , we will not elaborate them here due to the limit of space . E . The Impact of Skewed Distributions
. The reasons for 𝐷 , 𝑆𝐷 and 𝐷𝐵∗∗
It is common that clusters in a data set have unequal sizes . Figure 5 shows a synthetic data set Skewdistribution

An experiment is done on the data set Skewdistribution to evaluate the performance of different indices on data set with skewed distributions . We use Chameleon as the clustering algorithm . The experiment results listed in Table VI show that only 𝐶𝐻 cannot give the right optimal cluster number . Since 𝐶𝐻 = ( 𝑇 𝑆𝑆/𝑆𝑆𝐸 − 1)⋅ ( (𝑛− 𝑁 𝐶)/(𝑁 𝐶 − 1 ) ) and 𝑇 𝑆𝑆 is a constant number of a certain data set . Thus , 𝐶𝐻 is essentially based on 𝑆𝑆𝐸 , which shares the same basis with K means algorithm . As mentioned above , K means cannot handle skewed distributed data sets . Therefore , the similar conclusion can be applied to 𝐶𝐻 .
Table VII lists the validation properties of all 11 internal validation measures in all five aspects studied above , which may serve as a guidance for index selection in practice . In this table , ’–’ stands for property not tested , and ’×’ denotes situation cannot be handled . From Table VII we can see , 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 is the only internal validation measure which performs well in all five aspects , while the other measures have certain limitations in different scenarios , mainly in aspects of noise and subclusters .

IV . CONCLUDING REMARKS
In this paper , we investigated the validation properties of a suite of 11 existing internal clustering validation measures for crisp clustering in five different aspects : monotonicity , noise , density , subclusters and skewed distributions . Computational experiments on five synthetic data sets , which well represent the above five aspects respectively , were used to evaluate the 11 validation measures . As demonstrated by the experiment results , most of the existing measures have certain limitations in different application scenarios . 𝑆 𝐷𝑏𝑤 is the only measure that performs well in all five aspects . The summation of validation properties of these 11 internal validation measures shown in Table VII may serve as a guidance for index selection in practice .
