I . INTRODUCTION
Cascading processes are models of network diffusion used to study phenomenon concerning the spread of new trends and innovations in social networks . Each node can be in one of two states : infected ( ie , supports an idea or a product ) or uninfected . Every infected node can infect its neighbors and thus , the infection , formally called a cascade , propagates through the network . These processes have been studied in many applications such as viral marketing [ 10 ] , blog networks [ 24 ] and contagion models [ 8 ] .
Broadly two theoretical models of diffusion have been explored : the linear threshold model [ 14 ] , [ 29 ] and the independent cascade model [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . In the former , every infected neighbor for a node contributes certain weights and if their sum is greater than a threshold , the node is infected . The weights depend often on the edge strength between the node and its neighbors . In the latter , each infected node is allowed one chance to infect a neighbor with some probability generally depending on the edge strength between the nodes .
Existing literature has primarily focused on single cascade models but this assumption breaks down in many real world scenarios when there are many competing products , different political messages , ideas etc . It is also possible for nodes’ affinities towards certain cascades to evolve with those of their neighbors’ . This situation has different dynamics and requires more sophisticated models . Research in multiple cascades has looked at variations of the independent cascade model [ 5 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 22 ] . However , the models do not allow nodes to change their cascade states once infected . To the best of our knowledge , the research presented in this paper is the first to discusses multiple cascades while allowing nodes to switch between them .
The proposed model is a generalized version of the linear threshold model . It assumes that edges in the network are symmetric and carry non negative edge weights . For k cascades propagating in graph G(V , E ) , a node can be in k + 1 states ( any one of the casacades or uninfected ) and |V | possible states for G . The key challenge there are ( k + 1 ) is estimating the most likely state of the cascades’ spread in the network . A stochastic graph coloring process is presented and is shown to be a rapidly mixing Markov chain . This allows efficient simulation based algorithms for deducing the steady state distribution , and consequently the likely states of cascades’ spread in the network .
The rest of the paper is divided as follows Section 2 discusses related work . Section 3 presents the generalized linear threshold model along with an algorithm for estimating the most likely cascades’ spread in a given network . In Section 4 results using the proposed algorithm are investigated on real world networks from a variety of applications and Section 5 concludes the paper along with future directions .
II . RELATED WORK
Apart from the linear threshold and independent cascade models , Markov random field [ 9 ] , [ 28 ] and game theory based methods [ 26 ] for network diffusion have also been studied . One of the more interesting problems in cascading processes is that of influence maximization [ 9 ] , [ 20 ] . In [ 19 ] Kempe et al . prove that it is NP hard and show performance guarantees for greedy hill climbing strategies . A method for simulating propagation of a single cascade , while allowing nodes to switch between infected and uninfected states , for finite time segments is presented along with a general model that subsumes both the linear threshold and independent cascade models . In [ 11 ] the traditional independent cascade model is extended to allow nodes more than one chance to infect its neighbors . A comprehensive review on network diffusion processes and their applications can be found in [ 30 ] . Models for multiple cascades have been studied as extensions of the independent cascade model for the progressive case , where once a node is infected with a cascade , it never change its state [ 5 ] , [ 4 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 22 ] .
III . PROPOSED APPROACH
In the literature , graph coloring is the problem of labeling vertices , with k colors , so that no two adjacent vertices nature of the process , nodes are allowed to switch back and forth between the two states . For multiple cascades , jCj > 2 , weights from neighbors having different colors are summed up and one of the colors is sampled as the new state .
This trivial extension to the vanilla linear threshold model has three problems that make it unsuitable : ( i ) the trivial state of coloring all nodes with the same color is favored , ( ii ) if a state where some color cp is not assigned to any node is reached , then the chain can never transition to a state where any of the nodes have color cp . Thus , the chain is not ergodic and will not have a unique steady state distribution , and ( iii ) given the state space size jCj|V | , it is difficult to say how many iterations are required to reach steady state . The next sub section presents a small modification to ( 1 ) that addresses all of these problems .

Consider the graph G(V , E ) and set of colors C . In each step , node vi is sampled according to the fixed distribution J = wvi W , where wvi is weighted degree of vi and W is the total weighted degree in G . Then , given colors for all other nodes , color cp is sampled for vi with probability , pvi(cpjGC−vi ) = ( 2 ) In ( 2 ) β 2 ( 0 , 1 ) . This is also a Markov chain with state space S . In ( 2 ) , there is a chance β that node vi ignores its neighbors and picks a color from a uniform distribution . The number of colored states corresponding to 1 p jV j ′ number of partitions , is greater than the same for every p < p number of partitions . Consequently , the first term in the RHS of ( 2 ) acts as a regularizer against the second terms bias to color all nodes with the same color . For a stochastic process sampling colors for nodes in G according to ( 2 ) , ( i ) there are a finite number of states ( jSj = jCj|V | ) , ( ii ) every state is reachable from every other state , and ( iii ) aperiodic states exist . Thus the process is ergodic and will converge to a unique stationary state distribution . The nature of the steady state distribution depends on how the two terms in the RHS of ( 2 ) work together . The steady state distribution tends to favor states in which ( i ) nodes in close knit regions of the graph have the same color , ( ii ) no two such close knit regions with low connectivity between them have the same color . If a local region in G has high intra connectivity then a cascade should be endemic in this region and appear as a partition having the corresponding color . However , if two such adjoining colored partitions have sufficiently low connectivity between them then nodes within one partition have enough support for each others’ state such that there is significant resistance for the cascade from the adjoining partition to transition in and take over any of the nodes . Larger values of β favor states having more

( a ) G with 3 partitions , ( b ) Coloring the graph with cascades induces the same partitioning as ( a ) , note that endemic regions appear as smooth regions of colors , ( c ) Endemic regions with a coloring that merges p2 and p3 with the third cascade dying out , ( d ) Another coloring that splits p1 into two regions , allowing a fourth cascade in the network have the same color . In the context of this paper , a general definition of graph coloring is considered which includes problems of labeling vertices with k colors subject to a given set of constraints , not necessarily requiring adjacent vertices to have different colors .
A . Simulating cascades using graph coloring Consider an undirected graph G(V , E ) , with non negative edge weights wij > 0 for each edge ( i , j ) 2 E and no self loops wii = 0,8vi 2 V . Weight wij represents the similarity and/or affinity between nodes i and j . Nodes in G are colored using jCj number of colors from the set C = fc1 , c2 , . . . , c|C|g . The state space S of all possible colorings is of size jCj|V | and each colored state GC 2 S induces a corresponding partitioning on G . Nodes in each partition are a maximal subgraph in GC , such that they are all connected and have the same color . Semantically , the colors correspond to different states a node can be in , one of the cascades or uninfected . The partitions are the subgraphs , in G , where different cascades are endemic ( Figure 1 ) . Consider the following process : In each step , node vi 2 V is sampled uniformly and then a color cp is sampled for it . If 2 N ( vi ) GC is the current colored state of the graph and ni j is the jth neighbor of vi , then probability of assigning color cp to node vi , given colors for all other nodes is ,
∈N ( vi ) δni j
( cp)wini j
∈N ( vi ) wini j ni j
( 1 )
∑
∑ ni j pvi ( cpjGC−vi
) = j
( cp ) = 1 if node ni
In ( 1 ) , δni j is colored with cp and 0 otherwise . The process described in ( 1 ) is a Markov chain with state space being the set of all possible colorings of G using jCj colors . If jCj = 2 in ( 1 ) then the vanilla linear threshold model is obtained . Nodes can be in one of two states ( infected/uninfected ) and in each step weights from a node ’s infected neighbors are summed up and used as a Bernoulli probability to sample a new state for that node . This is equivalent to sampling a threshold between ( 0 , 1 ) . By number of tight knit endemic regions and lower values favor states with fewer number of coarser ( some of the tight knit regions are merged ) endemic regions .
The most important feature of this process is that it is a rapidly mixing Markov chain allowing us to place an upper bound on the number of steps required for the chain to reach steady state [ 16 ] . The following definitions will be used throughout the rest of the paper : wmin is the minimum weighted degree in the graph excluding isolated nodes . Statistical variation between two distributions D1 and D2 , on the same state space Ω , is denoted by jjD1 , D2jj jp1(i),p2(i)j , where p1(i ) and p2(i ) and given by 1 2 are probabilities for ith state in D1 and D2 respectively .

Lemma 1 : For a given undirected graph G(V , E ) with non negative edge weights and no self loops , if the Markov chain proposed in ( 2 ) takes t(ϵ ) number of steps to reach the steady state distribution then , t(ϵ ) W wminβ log jV j ϵ where ϵ is the statistical variation between the estimated distribution after t(ϵ ) steps and the true steady state distribution .
Proof : Consider two Markov chains MX and MY , both coloring the same graph G . In each step both chains pick the same node vi 2 V according to distribution J and each chain samples a new color for it . MX picks a new color cx vi for vi according to distribution DX,vi and MY uses distribution DY,vi to sample color cy vi for the same node . Let κs,v denote the distribution , according to ( 2 ) , for sampling a color for node v given the colored graph state s 2 S .
Define DXt,vi = κXt,vi . If c is picked by DXt,vi = c with probability then DYt,vi picks c minf1 , κYt,vi(c)/κXt,vi ( c)g , otherwise , sample c ′ according to the distribution , D(cs ) = max{0,κYt;vi ( cs)−κXt;vi ( cs)} || −κXt;vi

If MY is observed independent of MX , then it appears to be following ( 2 ) . Thus , a coupling is defined between them . Assume MY is following the true steady state distribution and their respective states Xt and Yt ( at some time t ) , differ only in the color of a single vertex vq 2 V . If ∆t is the number of nodes having different colors in Xt and Yt , then ∆t = 1 . According to the path coupling lemma [ 16 ] , in order to prove that ( 2 ) is rapidly mixing it is sufficient to show that the maximum possible value for E[∆t+1 ] is less than one ie , γ = maxXt,Yt∈S,vq∈V E[∆t+1 ] < 1 . Moreover , if the above condition holds then then the mixing −1)/(1 , γ ) . time will be t(ϵ ) log(jV jϵ We have , E[∆t+1 ] = 1 , P ( ∆t+1 = 0jXt , Yt ) + ∑ P ( ∆t+1 = 2jXt , Yt ) which gives us , f1,J(vq)+

Since , 0 < β < 1 we have γ < 1 and steady state is achieved in t(ϵ ) W steps .
Lemma 1 holds even when arbitrary multinomial distributions are used , instead of the uniform one , in the first term in the RHS of ( 2 ) . It also holds when one or more nodes are acting as sources for any of the cascades .
C . Computing multiple cascade simulation solutions
1 , GC 2
The steady state distribution corresponding to ( 2 ) is used to estimate the state most representative of the cascades’ spread in the network . The steady state distribution has a symmetry to it due to the colors being exchangable and any 2 S , where GC 1 can be obtained by two states GC 2 , are equivalent . Consequently , the permuting colors in GC steady state is a multi modal distribution and the expectation is not a good representation of how the different cascades will be endemic in the network . A preferred approach is to work with the most likely state instead of the expectation . estimated using simulated annealing [ 1 ] and the complete procedure , called StochColor , is presented in Algorithm 1 . Function getColoredPartitions(GC ) uses a breadth first search traversal method , that looks for connected regions having the same color , to compute partitions corresponding to the most likely state . Thus , the StochColor algorithm is used to estimate a solution state for simulating multiple cascades on G , with |V | +jCj) ) . |E| time complexity O(( W

StochColor takes as input : number of colors ( jCj ) , β , error ϵ and simulated annealing parameters final temperature ( Tf ) , cooling rate ( α ) . Empirically , results from StochColor were observed to be robust over large changes in them . Parameter ϵ measures error between estimated and true steady state distributions , in terms of statistical variation . It offers a runtime vs . accuracy trade off . Since we are interested in the most likely state and not the actual steady state distribution itself , larger errors in the estimated steady state distribution are tolerable and results are stable over orders of magnitude −20 was sufficient for many of change . Empirically ϵ = 10 applications . For the annealing process empirically it was observed that α = 0.99 and Tf = 0.1 worked well for networks from various domains . wminβ log

As β is increased , mixing properties of the chain improve , and states having more number of smaller tight knit endemic regions are favored . On lowering β , these tight knit endemic regions begin to merge into coarser ones . On most networks , β 0.2 and β 0.8 for obtaining coarse and finer regions , respectively , worked well . Results were robust even over orders of magnitude of changes in jCj and on increasing jCj a limiting behavior on the number of partitions in the most likely state , indicative of a “ cascade saturation number ” , was also observed . Consequently , overestimating the number of colors is always a good idea and jCj = 100 served well for most networks .
IV . EXPERIMENTS
In this section , results on real networks demostrate the quality of the estimated solution along with the impact of varying jCj and β . Figure 2 illustrates solutions estimated using StochColor on small social networks .

2 ) Observations : Table 2 compares StochColor with Graclus and Metis on datasets in Table 1 . StochColor is doing a little worse on add32 , comparable on brain and significantly better for all other graphs . The observations regarding NCut performances were consistent when varying jCj and β . Metis had memory issues with NDyeast and so the results are not reported . Table 3 presents similar results for Modularity . Figures 3 a and 3 b show the number of partitions returned by StochColor when varying jCj and β respectively . While results are generally stable over changes in C , on increasing it even to larger values , a limiting behavior on the number of partitions returned is observed as redundant colors die out . Semantically , this is indicative of a “ cascade saturation number ” ie , the maximum number of cascades that the network can support . For β the stability is relatively less and as expected , a general trend of larger β returning more partitions can be observed .

Figure 3 . Number of partitions vs changing parameters V . CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this work a generalized version of the liner threshold model , capable of handling multiple cascades while allowing nodes to switch back and forth between them , is presented . The corresponding stochastic process is shown to be a rapidly mixing Markov chain and the StochColor agorithm is provided for discovering the most likley states of the cascades’ spread in a given graph . Results on real data demonstrate the high quality of solutions estimated using StochColor , while revealing an interesting limiting behavior on the number of cascades’ surviving in the network . Future work will study the influence maximization problem as well as a more effective algorithm for computing the optimal state representative of the cascades’ behavior .
