In this paper , we present a data driven approach for ranking association rules ( ARs ) based on interestingness . The occurrence of unrelated or weakly related item pairs in an AR is interesting . In the retail market basket context , through various relationships arising due interaction , ‘substitutability’ and ‘complementarity.’ Item relatedness is a composite of these relationships . We introduce three relatedness measures for capturing relatedness between item pairs . These measures use the concept of function embedding the relatedness contributions due to complementarity and substitutability between items . We propose an interestingness coefficient by combining three relatedness measures . We compare two objective measures of interestingness and show the intuitiveness of the proposed interestingness coefficient .
1 . Introduction to appropriately weigh the this with
An important problem in association rule ( AR ) mining is the generation of a large number of mined rules . Usage of interestingness measures to rank ARs is a solution . Objective measures [ 1 , 12 , 13 ] quantify the interestingness of a rule in terms of rule structure and the underlying data used in rule generation . Subjective measures [ 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 18 ] , in addition incorporate views of the user while evaluating interestingness of patterns .
Here , we consider the retail market basket context . ARs reveal items that are likely to be purchased together . ARs that contain weakly related or unrelated items are interesting . This is because frequent co occurrence of such items is unexpected . We present a data driven approach to evaluating interestingness .
The paper is organized as follows . In the following section , we adopt a functional point of view to classify

We introduce and intuitively evolve three measures for capturing various aspects of item relatedness namely , MI ( a modification of confidence ) , CI and SI . We present an illustrative example . The three item relatedness measures are then combined to evolve a total relatedness coefficient ( TR ) . We then develop an interestingness coefficient ( IC ) using the basic relationship relatedness and interestingness are mutually inverse concepts . We compare IC with two commonly used objective measures of interestingness and bring out its intuitiveness .
2 . Item Relatedness
Any item possesses many attributes or properties . A subset of these properties implies a function – the purpose for which the item is manufactured . We consider only this primary function . In addition , an item may also possess many secondary functions . We define a simple function , as a function that cannot be sub divided ie it is atomic . A compound function is one that is realized by combining one or more simple or compound functions . A scenario or situation may consist of many such functions . A set of items possessing these functions to varying extents satisfies the scenario either partially or completely . A combination of many related scenarios constitutes a context , for example , a household context , an industrial context , etc .
Interacting functions give rise to relationships between the items . Any two items can be related through many such relationships . Item relatedness is a composite of these relationships . Relatedness is influenced by two attributes , strength of a relationship and cardinality of the set of relationships . Relatedness is directly proportional to the strength and also to the cardinality . Consider two items x and y . When they are brought together in a context , their primary functions may interact in one of the following ways .

21 Complementarity
Two items may be termed complementary if they together find application . The primary function of item x may need the primary function of item y when they are used together . This interaction between the two primary functions gives rise to a new compound function f . For example , a knife and a fork can be considered complementary to each other . The attribute of sharpness enables a knife to cut objects . A fork is needed to hold the object . Absence of any one of the items usually inhibits the effective execution of the compound function .
We identify two shades of complementarity ; intrinsic and flexible . The primary functions of two items , say x and y , may be inextricably bound together . Also , x and y may not serve any meaningful function independently . The compound function f , implied by the primary functions of items x and y can be realized if and only if the two items function together . We refer to this type of intrinsic complementarity . For complementarity as example , consider the case of a 0.5 mm clutch pencil and 0.5 mm leads . Though these items are sold separately in a retail store they are intrinsically complementary to each other . Neither of them can be used separately for writing on a piece of paper . Consider another situation in which the primary functions of two items not only interact with each other but also combine with primary functions of other items to imply different functions . For example , items x and y may interact with item z in one situation to imply function f1 . In another scenario , the same two items may interact with item w to imply function f2 . Flexible complementarity is the ability of the primary functions of two to serve multiple functions . In general , complementary items tend to be purchased together in purchase transactions .
22 Substitutability items
An item functionally substitutes another item if it serves the other ’s function to a significant extent . Thus , a pen can substitute a pencil as far as the function of writing on paper is concerned . Substitutes have similar or closely related primary functions . In general , substitutes belong to the same generic category . Generally , substitution is with respect to one single function in a particular context . Although substitutes are not used together , they are strongly related . Two items that substitute each other are likely to possess many similar or closely related attributes . If two items are substitutes to each other , then they are not to be purchased in the same transaction . However , two substitutable items are likely to be bought with identical or similar items that go with them , in separate transactions . likely
23 Non dependence
In case of non dependence , the primary functions of x and y do not interact with each other to serve any other compound function . Primary functions of x and y , however , may separately find application in different domains and different contexts . Since their functions do not interact , the likelihood of being used together in the same or similar contexts is quite low . Non dependent items are likely to be from different domains , for example , kitchen knife and 0.5 mm lead . A combination of non dependent items is unlikely to be purchased with a frequency higher than the product of the expected frequencies of the individual items . between two items take increases
Relatedness if complementarity and substitutability increases . A pair of items can shades of complementarity and substitutability depending on the context . Therefore , on some occasions , we do find substitutes being purchased together in the same transaction . Two items can exhibit different function demanded and the context . In this paper , we are concerned only with the primary functions of items .
3 . Measures for Item Relatedness relationships depending on the
We clarify some of the assumptions regarding customer purchasing behaviour that we make in our approach to item relatedness . First , we assume that items are purchased mainly for their primary function . Hence , we are concerned mainly with primary functions of items . Next , we assume that customers purchase items mainly for self or family consumption over a short period . Consequently , in customer purchasing behaviour . Hence , we draw conclusions about relatedness of items by examining customer transactions . item usage patterns get reflected
Consider a database of retail market basket transactions . Let I be the set of items available for sale in the retail market . I= {a , b , c , …} . Database D consists of a set of transactions , T . Each transaction t consists of a set of items purchased by a customer on a single buying instance at a retail store . Thus , x∈t⇒x∈I ; t⊆I .
Let x and y be two items occurring in an association rule whose relatedness is of interest to us . This means that t xy
≥ t minsup where |t| is the total number of transactions in the database . Let tx represent the set of transactions that contains item x but not y ; ty represent the set consisting of transactions containing item y but not x , and txy represent the set consisting of transactions containing both x and y . Each transaction in tx , ty and txy might contain items other than x and y accordingly . The remaining transactions
Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM’04 ) 0 7695 2142 8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE contain neither of the two items . In order to compute relatedness between items x and y , we need to examine txy and neighbourhood items in tx , ty and txy . Other items purchased with items x and y , can also contribute substantially to their relatedness if they are similar . This is because x and y might find applicability with other items in many more contexts than all by themselves . This increases their usefulness and relatedness .
Let Z be the set of items/item sets purchased together with x and y . In particular , an item set z∈ Z if t xyz minsup where minsup is user specified threshold .
≥ t xy
The item set z and the set Z are called co occurring neighbour of {x,y} and co occurring neighbourhood respectively . Co occurring neighbours are likely to be used together with items {x,y} . Therefore , a relationship exists between co occurring neighbours and item pair {x,y} . Similarly , let M and N be item sets that are purchased with items x and y in transaction sets tx and ty respectively . Then , M∩N is the set of item sets that are purchased with each of x and y separately . We call set M∩N the non co occurring neighbourhood of {x,y} and each item w∈M∩N the non co occurring neighbour . It should be noted that “ neighbourhood ” , as defined above , represents the item set frequently purchased along with a specific item pair . A context , on the other hand , is a combination of many related scenarios each of which may refer to a set of items . A context is not specific to any particular item pair . All neighbours of {x,y} need not occur in a context containing {x,y} . Here again we assume that items comprising sets M and N occur in respective transactions in significant numbers . In addition , transaction sets tx and ty are also assumed to be significant .
31 MI ( Mutual Interaction )
A customer is likely to purchase items that are used together in the same transaction . Thus , two items x and y , are related if they are purchased together in large numbers . The more the co occurrence , greater is the relatedness . Co occurrence of the two items implies that the function of item x and the function of items y interact with each other in a useful way . This gives rise to a compound function . However , the frequency of item x in transactions containing y need not equal the frequency of item y in transactions containing x . The presence of item x in transactions containing y can be stronger than the presence of item y in transactions containing x . This aspect is not captured if we consider only txy . We try to capture this aspect through mutual interaction measure , MI , given by :

( 1 ) where , f(xy ) is the total number of transactions containing items x and y together ie |txy| ; f(x ) is the total number of transactions in which item x occurs , either alone or along with other items which is |tx|+|txy| ; f(y ) is the total number of transactions in which item y occurs which is |ty|+|txy| . From ( 1 ) , it can be seen that MI equals the average confidence of ARs x→y and y→x . In other words , MI gives the predictive ability of the presence of one item given the other . Thus , MI gives us a numerical estimate of the mutual interaction of items x and y in the database . It does not consider the presence of other items that may occur with x , y , or both . MI can take a value in the range [ 0,1 ] . When items x and y are never purchased with each other , then MI takes a value of 0 . If the two items are intrinsically complementary to each other ( x always occurring with y and vice versa ) then the values of f(xy ) , f(x ) and f(y ) become equal and MI takes a value of 1 . Suppose x and y are perfectly substitutable with respect to their primary functions . This is reflected in their never being purchased together in transactions . Then , the value of f(xy ) approaches 0 and MI also approaches 0 . It should be noted that MI is computed by considering the value of f(xy ) only . On the other hand , the statistical measure correlation [ 11 ] considers both the presence and absence of items while computing linear dependency between items . A large positive correlation coefficient does not distinguish between presence ( of both the items ) and absence . Either of f(xy ) , f(¬x¬y ) might be large .
32 Function Embedding
The concept of function embedding helps us in deciding the relevant relationships to be included while calculating relatedness between items . Consider P={x , a , b , c} . We do not consider transactions containing P while evaluating its subsets as frequent/infrequent . While calculating its relatedness we need to assign a larger weight to it as compared to its frequently purchased subsets {x , a} , {x , b} and {x , a , b} . Transaction data decides the relevance of a particular function . Consider subset {x , a , c} of P . This subset does not imply a relevant function since it does not feature in the frequently purchased market baskets . Therefore , while assigning a weight to P we do not consider subset {x , a , c} .
The implied function of a set assigns a weight of 1 to it . In addition , each of its subsets purchased in separate transactions and in significant numbers assigns a weight of 1 . Thus , set P is assigned a weight of 4 . Sets {x , a} , {x , b} and {x , a , b} each contribute a weight of 1 to it . Similarly , {x , a , b} is assigned a weight of 3 . It should be noted that while calculating the weight of P , {x , a , b} ’s contribution is 1 ( and not 3 ) . This is because {x , a , b} implies one function different from its subsets . The functions of its subsets {x , a} and {x , b} have already been taken into account by their contributions to the weight of P . By assigning a weight of 1 to {x , a , b} we
Proceedings of the Fourth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining ( ICDM’04 ) 0 7695 2142 8/04 $ 20.00 IEEE avoid double counting the weights of {x , a} and {x , b} . Note that the number of non empty subsets of P is 15 .
33 CI ( Intensity of Complementarity ) indication of
Two items {x , y} are complementary if they are used together in significant numbers . Other items purchased with {x , y} give an the different relationships that may exist between x and y . Complementarity of {x,y} increases if this pair can be used together with other items in different situations . Note that an item set {a , b} and its subset {a} can both be considered as co occurring neighbours of {x , y} if and only if both are individually purchased with {x , y} in significant numbers . While considering the significance of the occurrence of set {a} along with {x , y} we do not consider its occurrence in set {a , b} . This is because we consider sets {a} and {a , b} as separate sets that serve different functions .
W , β w ≥Sig , where Sig is a user defined threshold . Wt(w ) α is the weightage of the item set w . Wt(w)=1+v ; where v is the number of subsets of w∈M∩N . w , β w β
The weight of an item set gives an indication of the number of useful functions implied by w . α W gives the proportion of transactions containing x ( and not y ) with item set w in it . Similarly , β w gives the proportion of transactions containing y ( and not x ) with w . α w ≥Sig ensures that item set w occurs in a significant portion of tx and ty . |α w| gives the deviation of this proportionate occurrence of item set w with items x and y in tx and ty respectively . Intuitively , we can expect substitutes to interact in a similar manner with respect to items they substitute . Therefore , if x and y substitute each other perfectly with respect to w , α w can be expected to be nearly equal and |α w| will take a value close to 0 . At this point the deviation is the lowest and we should get highest value for substitutability contribution ie weight w β of the item set w . Greater the deviation |α w| , lower the relatedness . Therefore , we subtract |α w β w| from 1 to give the contribution of w to relatedness due to substitutability . We have used two filters to ensure that substitutability contributions from non co occurring neighbours are significant . The first filter ensures that the size of tx is w and β w β
Let Z be the set of all co occurring neighbours of {x , y} . Note that each element of Z can be either a single item or a set of items . The intensity of complementarity is given by : CI = 0 if |Z|=0 ie Z=φ

34 SI ( Intensity of Substitutability ) in to the presence of this relatedness between
Item sets in the non co occurrence neighbourhood of {x,y} contribute them . Consider an item w present in the non co occurrence neighbourhood of {x,y} . Thus , items x and y can substitute each other item set w∈(M∩N ) . If there are many such cases of x and y substituting each other with respect to different item sets from the relatedness of {x , y} increases . This is because items x and y can substitute each other with respect to many functions . Common attributes between x and y in turn imply greater relatedness . We try to capture this aspect through measure SI . SI is given by : SI = 0 if ( M∩N)=φ

Then , SI can be directly assigned a value of 0 . The second filter considers the frequency of non cooccurring neighbours of x in tx . α w ≥Sig ensures that item set w occurs in a significant portion of tx and ty of the database .
35 Total Relatedness ( TR ) Coefficient w , β
Total relatedness coefficient TR is the sum of the values of the three relatedness measures . Thus , TR= MI + CI +SI ( 4 ) the summation
The rationale for is as follows . Relatedness between x and y is a composite of relationships existing between them . Stronger and larger number of relationships implies greater relatedness . Therefore , TR includes both the strength of relationships and the number of relationships between x and y . As can be observed from Equation 1 , MI reveals the strength of only one relationship ie mutual interaction between x and y . Its value varies in the range [ 0 , 1 ] . CI and SI bring out the intensity of complementarity and substitutability between the two items . Complementarity is due to the interaction between item sets present in {x,y} ’s cooccurring neighbourhood and {x,y} . On the other hand , substitutability the consequence of is a

4 . From Relatedness to Interestingness
TR reveals the total relatedness of an item pair based on information contained in transactions . Relatedness contributions due to substitutability and complementarity components for two unrelated items such as {beer , diaper} may not be high . Hence , TR will be assigned a low value . On the other hand , two related items may be expected to have similar or closely related properties . Many complementarity and substitutability relationships may arise due to these closely related properties . Hence two related items , such as {bread , butter} , can be expected to have a high TR value . From the relatedness perspective , a rule containing {beer , diaper} would be deemed more interesting than a rule containing {bread , butter} . However , in general , an AR contains more than one item pair . Therefore , we need one consolidated value that represents the AR rather than any one of its itempairs . It can be intuitively argued that the relatedness of a set of items is driven by the least related item pair in it [ 6 ] . Let {a1 , a2 , … , an}→{ b1 , b2 , … , bm} represent an AR . ( m+n)C2 item pairs can be formed from this AR . Let the least related item pair among these ( m+n)C2 item pairs be {x,y}and its total relatedness coefficient be TR(x,y ) .
Since relatedness and interestingness are opposing notions , the interestingness of an AR can be given by :

*TR value of the least related item pair in a rule is displayed when the rule has more than two items .
Consider two ARs : AR1 and AR2 . Let the least related item pair in both rules be the same . If AR1 has more items than AR2 , then AR1 can be more interesting than AR2 . This is because AR1 brings out more relationships with the most interesting pair . This intuition leads us to weighing the interestingness of an AR by the cardinality of item pairs in it . In Equation 5 , k is the constant of proportionality . The importance given to the cardinality of item pairs in a rule can be altered by assigning an appropriate value to ‘k’ . A value of k<1 decreases the contribution of the cardinality of item pairs to IC . Here , IC has been calculated using k=1 . Finally , we note that TR(x,y ) can never be zero . This is because each item pair of an AR has a relatedness component due to cooccurrence , namely MI . Since {x , y} is selected from an AR , MI will have a value not less than the minimum support .

Table 3 contains information about the 10 ARs mined from the transaction set given in Table 1 . The ARs have been ordered their interestingness using IC . IC assigns identical values ( 0.5388 ) to rules {c}→{e} and {e}→{c} . This is because the TR coefficient from which IC is derived , considers antecedent and consequent of a rule in a symmetric fashion . MI component of TR considers the average predictive ability of an item in the presence of the other . Rule {c,e}→{b} gets the highest IC value of 16164 This is due to two factors : the presence of the least related item pair {c,e} , and the weight accorded to the number of item pairs in the rule . Item pair {c,e} has a low TR value of 1856 In addition , the rule has three item pairs . We can

It is assigned an IC value of 05388 This is despite {c}→{e} having the same least related item pair as in rule {c,e}→{b} . Thus , we observe that IC is larger if : ( 1 ) The least related item pair of the rule has a low relatedness value . ( 2)The rule has many item pairs .
Rule {a}→{b} is assigned the lowest IC value of 02233 It has the highest TR value . This is because items a and b are effective substitutes of each other . They are not co occurrence or complementarity . This component of relatedness due to substitutability is ignored by support and confidence . strongly related due to respectively . This
From Table 3 , it can be seen that the most interesting rule does not have the highest support .

This observation corroborates our viewpoint that all relationships between item pairs need to be examined to bring out the item pair ’s interestingness . Support and confidence may be used as preliminary filters to select significant rules . The selected rules can then be ordered by IC . substitutability namely

5 . Comparative Analysis
We compare IC with two commonly used objective measures of interestingness present in the data mining literature . The chosen measures are Conviction ( V ) [ 12 , 15 ] and Interest ( Int ) [ 12 , 15 , 16 , 19 ] . Conviction is considered to have an edge over confidence with respect to measuring implication [ 15 ] . Int is essentially a measure of departure from independence . Int=1 if the two items are completely symmetric implication . independent . However , by being it measures only co occurrence and not
Consider the 2 item rules . V measures the strength of implication . Therefore , in general we can say that higher V values mean antecedent items and consequent items are strongly related . Rules having higher V values should be less interesting from relatedness viewpoint . Thus , higher values of conviction should be related to lower IC values . Consider rule {f}→{e} . This rule is assigned a high Vvalue of 13600 Its IC value is also low ( 02647 ) In this example , V and IC seem to be related as expected . We note that item pair {f,e} has a high TR value of 3.7785 due to the large contribution from SI .
However , from Table 3 we see that in general , rules having higher IC values have higher V values . For example , rule {e}→{c} has an IC and V value of 0.5388 and 1.144 respectively . On the other hand , rule {b}→{c} which has a lower IC value of 0.3840 also has a lower Vvalue ( 1.04 ) as compared to {e}→{c} . According to V , relatedness of {e,c} is more than that of {b,c} . The Vvalues imply that {b,c} is more interesting than {e,c} , while IC values seem to suggest the reverse . This apparent counter intuitive result can be explained if we examine the TR components for pairs {e,c} and {b,c} . The pair {e , c} has a lower TR value as compared to the pair {b , c} mainly due to {e , c} ’s SI value being assigned a value of 0 . This results in {e,c} being assigned a higher IC value than {b,c} . Since V ignores components of relatedness due to substitutability and complementarity , interesting rules brought out by V may not give the complete picture . Consider the Int values . Brijs , et al . [ 19 ] give an interpretation of Interest . For an AR ‘economical’ {a}→{b} , Interest > 1 indicates complementarity effects between a and b while indicates substitutability effects . Items a and b are conditionally independent when Interest = 1 . Consider rule {e}→{b} . It has an Int value of 0.9848 and an IC value of 03486 From the economic interpretation of Int , items e and b should be substitutes . However , from Table 2 we see that CI value of {e , b} ( 1.4615 ) is greater than its SI value ( 08954 ) Thus , items e and b are also complementary . This aspect is not brought out by Int .
Consider rule {a}→{b} . It has an Int value of 0.9420 while IC assigns a value of 0.2233 to it . The Int value indicates that a and b are substitutes for each other . This is confirmed by the SI component ( 2.6705 ) of the TR coefficient for {a , b} . There also exists some degree of complementarity between items a and b . This again is not brought out by Int . Another observation pertaining to rule {c,e}→{b} is as follows . IC assigns the highest value of 1.6164 to it , whereas the values assigned by V and Int are 1.200 and 1.11 respectively . We cannot infer from the V and Int values that the rule {c , e}→{b} is the most interesting one of the ten rules .
Interest < 1 in
V and Int do not explicitly account for the number of item pairs in a rule or give additional weightage to the most interesting pair in a rule . This might result in counter intuitive results as shown the following example . Consider the rule {c,e}→{b} and its sub rule {c}→{b} . We note that the item pair {c,e} in {c,e}→{b} is less related than {c,b} . Also , {c,e}→{b} has three item pairs while {c}→{b} has only one . Therefore , according to IC rule {c,e}→{b} ( 1.6164 ) is more interesting than {c}→{b} ( 03840 ) V values for {c,e}→{b} and {c}→{b} are 1.20 and 1.0667 respectively . This means that the items in the first rule are more dependent on each other and hence less interesting . Similarly , Int values for {c,e}→{b} and {c}→{b} are 1.110 and 1.04167 respectively . This seems to suggest that item c and item b are more independent and hence rule {c}→{b} is more interesting . This seems to be counter intuitive as {c}→{b} is contained in {c,e}→{b} . In addition , it conveys than {c,e}→{b} . less knowledge about the domain
All items in the antecedent and consequent are considered while computing V and Int . This can lead to the masking of the contribution of the least related itempair . V and Int do not consider substitutability and complementarity explicitly . Therefore , interestingness rankings based on IC values are more intuitive than those due to V and Int . relationships
6 . Discussions
Objective measures like support [ 1 , 12 ] , confidence [ 1 , 12 ] , conviction [ 12 , 15 ] and interest [ 12 , 15 , 16 ] have been extensively used in data mining studies . Hilderman and Hamilton [ 13 ] survey seventeen interestingness measures from the data mining literature . Tan , Kumar and Srivatsava [ 12 ] have described several key properties that can be used to select the right objective measure for a given application . Our approach is different from the traditional approaches [ 12 , 13 ] . Jaroszewicz and Simovici [ 17 ] have proposed a measure that is a generalization of many conditional and unconditional classical measures . Omiecinski alternative interestingness measures for associations : any confidence , all confidence and bond . Our work is quite different from these two studies on two counts . We consider classical association rules in a retail market basket context . Secondly , in the studies mentioned , relationships have not explicitly been taken into account . proposed three

Our approach considers the simultaneous existence of complementarity and substitutability unlike Brijs , et al . [ 19 ] . Substitution rules were introduced by Teng and others [ 20 ] . According to them , an item set X is a substitute for Y if X and Y are negatively correlated along with the existence of a negative AR ( X→¬Y ) in mined rule set . On the other hand , in our approach , the degree of substitutability ( a component of relatedness ) of an item pair {x , y} is computed by identifying item sets that occur in {x , y} ’s non co occurring neighbourhood . Other relationships like flexible complementarity and mutual interaction have also been considered in our approach . Dong and Li [ 9 ] have presented a method of evaluating interestingness of ARs in terms of neighbourhood based unexpectedness . The neighbourhood of a rule is defined in terms of a distance function on rules . In our work , we consider both co occurring and non co occurring neighbours of items . We also compare our interestingness coefficient two objective measures of interestingness Conviction ( V ) and Interest ( Int ) . It is seen that IC compares favourably with V and Int in ranking ARs . IC also takes into account aspects of relatedness not accounted for by V and Int , thus making it more intuitively appealing . IC the antecedent and consequent of an AR in a symmetric fashion . As a part of our future work , we propose to examine the feasibility of generalizing IC to account for directionality of ARs . In addition , we also propose the suggested framework on real life datasets .
