Abstract
Improving predictions of the skin permeability coefficient is a difficult problem . It is also an important issue with the increasing use of skin patches as a means of drug delivery . In this work , we apply K nearest neighbour regression , single layer networks , mixture of experts and Gaussian processes to predict the permeability coefficient . We obtain a considerable improvement over the quantitative structureactivity relationship ( QSARs ) predictors . We show that using five features , which are molecular weight , solubility parameter , lipophilicity , the number of hydrogen bonding acceptor and donor groups , can produce better predictions than the one using only lipophilicity and the molecular weight . The Gaussian process regression with five compound features gives the best performance in this work .
1 . Introduction
In this paper , we address the problem of predicting the rate at which various compounds penetrate human skin . This is an important issue with the increasing use of skin patches as a means of drug delivery . There are two main approaches used to predict and understand the skin penetration procedure . One is quantitative structure activity relationships ( QSARs ) , and the other is mathematical modelling [ 4 ] . Recently more new approaches , for example , artificial neural network and fuzzy modelling , have been applied to this domain [ 3 ] .
One problem addressed here is how to improve predictions of the skin permeability coefficient by applying advanced machine learning techniques , for example , Gaussian Processes . To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that Gaussian processes modelling has been applied to skin permeability data . One key feature of this problem domain is that the target , skin permeability coefficient , may have a strongly non linear relationship with the compound descriptors ( features ) . We demonstrate a feasibility of prediction improvement by using computational regression modelling methods .
Another issue discussed in this work is to investigate new compound descriptors to the problem . We show that involving three new descriptors , which are solubility parameter , the number of hydrogen bonding acceptor and donor groups , simply gives a more detailed description of the molecule in relation to the skin .
2 Problem Domain
Percutaneous absorption has been a significant challenge for pharmaceutical scientists for the last 50 years . As recently as the 1960 . s , it was assumed that drugs could not pass through the skin . However , as knowledge of the detailed structure of the skin barrier the stratum corneum , the skin ’s outermost layer increased , new technologies gradually became available for the treatment of medical conditions by transdermal therapy . The stratum corneum is the main barrier to percutaneous absorption , and this is due to its structure and properties . It is a very thin layer , commonly 15 − 30μm on the volar forearm , for example . This layer effectively governs the rate of passage of exogenous chemicals across the skin and into the viable tissues from the external environment . It is a densely packed layer consisting of dead , flattened keratin cells enmeshed in a lipid domain . While qualitative estimates of percutaneous absorption were common until the 1980 . s , it was not until 1990 , and the publication of the Flynn dataset [ 5 ] that a quantitative approach to skin absorption was proposed . Flynn determined ,

1049 1049 in a semi quantitative manner , that skin absorption was influenced predominately by two compound descriptors the lipophilicity of a molecule and its molecular weight ( M W ) . The former descriptor defines the ability of a molecule to partition between lipid and aqueous layers , represented by n octanol and water ( or buffer ) , respectively . This is then defined as log P , the logarithm of the ratio of concentrations in , respectively , the lipid and aqueous domains . Molecular weight is effectively a measure of the size of the molecule , and is related to the lipophilicity in a generalised sense that , when M W is increased it is most likely due to the addition of lipophilic groups onto the molecule .
Potts and Guy [ 14 ] used the Flynn dataset to derive a linear equation that quantified percutaneous absorption : log Kp = 0.71 log P − 0.0061MW − 6.3 , log Kp the is
( 1 ) where a concentration corrected measure of drug transport , or flux , across a membrane ( such as the skin ) , log P is the lipophilicity and M W the molecular weight . permeability coefficient ,
In essence , Flynn used the data that was available to him from the literature . This means that there is an uneven distribution of this data across the whole range of interest , and that the data is generally skewed by certain compound descriptors , such as log P and M W .
Moss and Cronin [ 8 ] developed the Potts and Guy model by evaluating the role of steroids in the dataset . Thus , the model is based on a slightly larger and more robust dataset . It is represented by the following equation : log Kp(cm/s ) = 0.74 log P − 0.0091M W − 2.39 , where log Kp , log P and MW are as defined earlier .
( 2 )
A number of similar equations have been derived since the publication of Potts and Guy ’s model . Moss et al [ 10 ] compared a series of published models . They showed that there were significant differences between log Kp values that were measured experimentally and those that were determined using the Potts and Guy ( and other ) equations . Interestingly , they showed that the greatest difference between experimental and predicted values was found at high log P values . In effect , the absorption is Gaussian in its distribution , if assessed by log P in particular . This contradicts the linear nature of the Potts and Guy ( and similar ) equations , although the concomitant increase in log P and M W is often offset by the negative sign in front of M W .
Therefore , there is compelling qualitative evidence that suggests the non linear response to skin absorption that is missing from the linear equations , such as Potts and Guy . Non linear modelling might provide a prediction for percutaneous absorption for molecules with a wide range of log P values .
In [ 2 ] , an artificial neural network was developed , where M W , log P and partial change of the penetrant molecule
1050 1050 were used as inputs , and was applied to skin permeability data for the first time . In [ 11 ] , an ensemble model using Knearest neighbour and ridge regression to predict skin permeability coefficients was proposed , where three computational descriptors , which are M W , log P and solvation free energy , were used as inputs . Note that both partial change of the penetrant molecule and solvation free energy are useful descriptors , but they are difficult to be calculated without specialist software .
In previous work [ 13 ] , Gaussian processes ( GP ) modelling has been used to predict log P . To the best of our knowledge , the GP methods have not been applied to skin permeability data . In this work , we investigate the nonlinear response to skin absorption by applying computational regression modelling methods : K nearest neighbour regression , single layer networks ( SLN ) , mixture of experts and Gaussian processes .
3 A Description of the Data
The dataset employed in this study has been collated with reference to a range of literature sources . It predominately consists of the Flynn dataset , used by Potts and Guy , and others . It contains several additions , whose origins are described in Moss et al . [ 9 ] . The whole dataset consists of 149 compounds . Usually , log P and M W appear to be the only significant features in QSAR forms . However , in some cases ( such as [ 12 ] ) other features achieve significance ; these features are often calculated using expensive specialised software . Since they often provide only marginal improvements in the prediction of log Kp compared to other QSAR models , there is little application of them in the field . In this work , 5 molecular features in total are involved . They are molecular weight ( M W ) , solubility parameter ( SP ) , log P ( often described , for example by Potts and Guy , as log Pknown ) , counts of the number of hydrogen bonding acceptor ( HA ) and donor groups ( HD ) , respectively , that can be found on a molecule .
SP relates the solubility of a penetrant to the solubility of the stratum corneum , the skin barrier . If a molecule is too soluble in the stratum corneum it might not be soluble in the rest of the skin , and it might therefore have poor skin penetration overall . So , the use of SP will provide an indication of the mostly lipophilic molecules likely to exhibit this behaviour . HA and HD are the hydrogen bonding terms . Hydrogen bonds ( H bonds ) are specific covalent bonds between a hydrogen on one molecule and a highly electronegative atom on a different molecule . HA is a H bond acceptor , such as oxygen , nitrogen or fluorine . HD is a Hbond donor , normally a hydrogen which is itself attached to a highly electronegative atom . HA and HD are associated with electronegativity and H bonding . This is a polar phenomenon and as such might be associated with retarding

It is interesting to note that in CV1 the least important features ( those with lowest coeffecients ) are M W and log P . Actually , the canonical correlation coefficient is approximately 0.415 , while the canonical correlation coefficient between log Kp and a group of two variables , M W and log P is about 0238
3.1 Visualisation of the skin data
4 Modelling Methods
The scatter plot matrix in Figure 1 shows data for all 149 compounds with 5 features against each other , and the diagonal shows the shape of the distribution of each feature . The subplot appearing in the first row and last column shows M W against log Kp . It suggests that very similar log Kp values can correspond to many different M W values . This is also true of log Pknown and log Kp . It can also be seen that there is no simple linear replationship between any pair of descriptors .
3.2 Canonical correlation analysis
Canonical correlation analysis ( CCA ) [ 6 ] can be used to find a projection that maximises the correlation between two sets of variables .
In this work , we group M W , SP , log P , HA and HD into one set , and log Kp into another set . Our aim is to investigate the correlating linear relationship between log Kp and the 5 compound descriptors . The canonical variable 1 ( CV1 ) in Figure 2 is a combination of 5 descriptors used in this work : CV 1 = 0.002M W − 0.116SP + 0.033 log P +
4.1 Single layer network
First of all , we consider a single layer network ( SLN ) on the regression problem , which is a simple linear regression . The output y is the weighted sum of the components of an input x , The weights are set so that the sum squared error function is minimised on a training set .
4.2 K nearest neighbour regression
Given a test input x , the algorithm finds K closest points to x among all the training inputs . The prediction of the model is therefore the average of those K target values . In our experiments , we apply Euclidean distance in the K nearest neighbour ( KNN ) regression to do the distance measurement .
4.3 Mixture of experts
The mixture of experts [ 7 ] divides the input space into a nested set of regions . In each region a simple surface is
1051 1051 fitted to the data . It consists of a gating network and experts . The function of the gating network is to partition the input space so that each expert only needs to model a small region . The gating network receives the input x , and outputs a scalar value pi with the property that pi ≥ 0 and . i pi = 1 . The final prediction of the model is a sum of the expert predictions weighted by pi . In this work , all local experts are linear regression models .
4.4 Gaussian process regression GPR
Gaussian process ( GP ) modelling is a non parametric method , which does not produce an explicit functional representation of the data . Here it is assumed that the underlying function , f(x ) , that produces the data will remain unknown , but that the data is produced from a ( infinite ) set of functions , with a Gaussian distribution in the function space .
A Gaussian process is completely characterised by its mean and covariance function . For simplicity , we usually consider the mean function to be the zero everywhere function . The covariance function , k(xi , xj ) , is crucial to GP modelling . It expresses the expected correlation between values f(x ) at the two points xi , xj . In other words , it defines nearness or similarity between data points .
In this work , we apply the squared exponential covariance function , which incorporates noise into the model , as follows : fi
− 1 2
' ( xi−xj)T M(xi−xj ) f exp k(xi , xj ) = σ2 nδij , ( 3 ) where M = l−2I , l is characteristic length scale , σf is signal variance , σn is noise variance , and δij is a Kronecker delta which is one iff i = j and zero otherwise .
+σ2
To make a prediction f(x∗ ) a new input x∗ , we need to compute the conditional distribution p(f(x∗)|y1 , . . . , yNtrn ) on the observed vector [ y1 , . . . , yNtrn ] . Since our model is a Gaussian process , this distribution is also a Gaussian and is completely defined by its mean and variance . The mean at x∗ is given by at

E[f(x∗ ) ] = kT∗ ( K + σ2
( 4 ) In eq(4 ) , k∗ denotes the vector of covariances between the test point and the Ntrn training data ; K denotes the covariance matrix of the training data ; σ2 n denotes the variance of an independent identically distributed Gaussian noise , which means observations are noisy ; and y denotes the vector of training targets .
The variance at x∗ is given by var[f(x∗ ) ] = k(x∗ , x∗ ) − kT∗ ( K + σ2 nI ) where k(x∗ , x∗ ) denotes the variance of y∗ .

We use the mean as our prediction and the variance as error bars on the prediction .

5 Performance Measures
We apply three common measurements for assessing regression performance , which are normalised mean squared error ( NMSE ) , percent improvement over a naive model ( ION ) , and negative log loss ( NLL ) .
The mean squared error ( MSE ) measures the average squared difference between model predictions and the corresponding targets . Here we report the NMSE which is to normalise MSE by the variance of target values .
In the naive model for any input the prediction is always the same value , namely the mean of log Kp in the training set . Denote mean squared error of a naive model as M SEnaive . The degree of improvement of the model over the Naive predictor can be quantified by the ION measure [ 13 ] , that is ION = M SEnaive−M SE
× 100 % .
M SEnaive
.
Finally , when we investigate GP ’s results , we also consider the average negative log estimated predictive denn − log p(yn|xn ) , where sity NLL , given by N LL = 1 N is the number of test cases , and − log p(y∗|x∗ ) = N 2 log(2πσ2∗ ) + ( y∗−E[f ( x∗)])2 , in which case σ2∗ is the predictive variance , and y∗ is the target value at x∗ . A small value shows good performance .

When we analyse the results , we want a model which on the test set provides low values of both NMSE and NLL and high values of both ION and the correlation coefficient ( CORR ) .
6 Experiments
6.1 Simulation setup
In this work , we randomly divided the whole dataset into a training set including 130 compounds , and an independent test set consisting of the remaining 19 compounds . We then applied those modelling methods described in Section 4 on the training set and do prediction on the independent test set using the trained models . We repeated this whole procedure 10 times , each time for a different randomly assigned training and test sets . To investigate whether predictions can be improved by involving all 5 features rather than the original 2 features used in the QSAR forms , ( M W and log P ) , we employed regression modelling methods with both 2 and 5 compound features .
In K nearest neighbour modelling , we varied the number of neighbours , K , between 1 and 10 ; in the mixture of experts , we set the number of experts between 2 and 5 . In Gaussian process modelling , we initialised the logarithm of characteristic length scale , the logarithm of signal variance , and noise variance from the set [ log(1.0 ) log(1.0 ) log(0.1 ) ; log(2.0 ) log(1.0 ) log(0.1 ) ; log(1.0 ) log(2.5 ) log(0.3 ) ; log(0.7 ) log(2.5 ) log(0.3 ) ; log(0.3 ) log(1.0 ) log(0.1 ) ; log(1.0 ) log(1.2 ) log(0.9 ) ; log(2.0 ) log(1.2 ) log(0.9 ) ; log(0.3 ) log(1.2 ) log(0.9 ) ; log(1.0 ) log(0.6 ) log(0.01 ) ; log(0.7 ) log(0.6 ) log(001 ) ] We used a 5 fold cross validation procedure to select optimal parameters for each of K nearest neighbour , the mixture of experts , and Gaussian process . In these cases , each training set is further divided into training and validation sets .
We applied Rasmussen and Williams ’s [ 15 ] GP toolbox to do Gaussian process modelling ; and employed the Bayes Net Toolbox , which is publicly available at http://wwwcsubcca/∼murphyk/Software/BNT/bnthtml#ack , to do the mixture of experts modelling .

6.2 Experimental results
Before we do experiments using the trainable regression models , we first apply the QSAR forms ( eqs . ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) ) introduced in section 2 to the whole dataset . Table 1 shows the results . The results are the averages on the 10 independent test sets . For comparison , Table 1 also shows results from the Naive model . In general , all QSAR predictions are worse than naive predictions , especially with Potts’ QSAR form .
Table 2 shows results obtained using computational modelling methods from the machine learning field with M W and log P as descriptors . One can see that all 4 methods have improved the naive predictions , with K nearestneighbour giving the best results . The average of the optimal number of neighbours , K , was equal to 84 Not surprisingly , the single layer network , which is a simple linear regression model , performed worst .
Results obtained with 5 compound descriptors are shown in Table 3 . Comparing with Table 2 , one can see that all 4 regression modelling methods have improved their performance when using 5 features rather than 2 . This big improvement in performance confirms that the 3 additional features are very important in predicting skin permeability . The Gaussian process regression gives the best performance , Figure 3 displays a box plot of normalised mean squared errors from 10 independent test sets on Naive model , the Moss QSAR form , and those 4 computational modelling methods with 5 features . It shows that the Gaussian process regression with 5 features ( GPRf5 ) gives the lowest upper quartile , median and lower quartile values on NMSE . Although the mixture of experts with 5 features ( MIXEXPf5 ) has comparable low median and lower quartile values , its upper quartile value and the largest NMSE value are much bigger than those obtained from GPRf5 . It suggests that GPRf5 has a relatively stable and robust performance . On the other hand , one can see the QSAR form ( Moss ) has the highest lower quartile , median and upper quartile values .

7 Conclusions
There are two main quantitative conclusions from this study . First , we get a considerable improvement over the linear QSAR predictor by using non linear regression methods . In fact , the QSAR prediction even gives worse prediction than the naive model . Secondly , the trainable regression methods with five features have much better results than those obtained using only two features . We conclude that the Gaussian processes model with five compound descriptors has the best performance on the NMSE , ION and CORR measures .
Involving the three new descriptors , SP , HA and HD , simply gives a more detailed description of the molecule in relation to the skin . Quantifying a key molecular descriptor might provide more information for the model , and it might allow a more detailed estimation of the key properties of a penetrant . There are lots of other descriptors we could have looked at , and which we should look at in future work . However , the descriptors used in this work are chosen not only for their applicability but for the ease with which they can be determined . This means that any method which uses these descriptors is not only significant but can be easily used by other researchers .
