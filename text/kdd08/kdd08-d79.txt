ABSTRACT We present a detailed study of network evolution by analyzing four large online social networks with full temporal information about node and edge arrivals . For the first time at such a large scale , we study individual node arrival and edge creation processes that collectively lead to macroscopic properties of networks . Using a methodology based on the maximum likelihood principle , we investigate a wide variety of network formation strategies , and show that edge locality plays a critical role in evolution of networks . Our findings supplement earlier network models based on the inherently non local preferential attachment .
Based on our observations , we develop a complete model of network evolution , where nodes arrive at a prespecified rate and select their lifetimes . Each node then independently initiates edges according to a “ gap ” process , selecting a destination for each edge according to a simple triangle closing model free of any parameters . We show analytically that the combination of the gap distribution with the node lifetime leads to a power law out degree distribution that accurately reflects the true network in all four cases . Finally , we give model parameter settings that allow automatic evolution and generation of realistic synthetic networks of arbitrary scale .

INTRODUCTION
In recent years a wide variety of models have been proposed for the growth of complex networks . These models are typically advanced in order to reproduce statistical network properties observed in real world data . They are evaluated on the fidelity with which they reproduce these global network statistics and patterns . In many cases , the goal is to define individual node behaviors that result in a global structure such as power law node degree distributions ; in other cases , the goal is to match some other network property such as small diameter .

For example , the observation of heavy tailed degree distributions [ 10 ] led to hypothesis about edge creation processes ( eg , preferential attachment [ 1 ] ) that could lead to this observation . In fact , there are several edge creation processes that all lead to heavytailed degree distributions and it is not clear which among them captures reality best .
Here we take a different approach . Instead of only focusing on the global network structure and then hypothesizing about what kind of microscopic node behavior would reproduce the observed macroscopic network structure , we focus directly on the microscopic node behavior per se . For the first time at such a large scale , we study a sequence of millions of individual edge arrivals , which allows us to directly evaluate and compare microscopic processes that give rise to global network structure .
Evaluation based on likelihood . Given that the microscopic behavior of nodes solely determines the macroscopic network properties , a good network model should match real world data on global statistics , while maximizing the likelihood of the low level processes generating the data . Towards this goal , we propose the use of model likelihood of individual edges as a way to evaluate and compare various network evolution models .
Likelihood has not been considered to date in the analysis of evolution of large social networks mainly due to lack of data and computational issues . Many early network datasets contained only a single or a small number of snapshots of the data , making likelihood computations for evolutionary models infeasible . We study four large social networks with exact temporal information about individual arrivals of millions of nodes and edges . Here we are therefore able to consider edge by edge evolution of networks , and hence efficiently compute the likelihood that a particular model would have produced a particular edge , given the current state of the network . In contrast to previous work on evolution of large networks that used a series of snapshots to consider patterns at global scale , we study the exact edge arrival sequence , which means we are able to directly observe and model the fine grained network evolutionary processes that are directly responsible for global network patterns and statistics .
A likelihood based approach has several advantages over ap proaches based purely on global statistics :
( 1 ) Models may be compared directly in a unified way , rather than arguing whether faithful reproduction of , eg , diameter is more important than clustering coefficient and so forth .
( 2 ) As our understanding of real world networks improves , the evaluation criterion , ie , likelihood , remains unchanged while the generative models improve to incorporate the new understanding . Success in modeling can therefore be effectively tracked .
( 3 ) Models may be meaningfully distinguished based on as yet undiscovered properties of real world data .
Data and model structure . We consider four large online social network datasets — FLICKR ( flickr.com , a photo sharing website ) , DELICIOUS ( delicious , a collaborative bookmark tagging website ) , YAHOO! ANSWERS ( answersyahoocom , a knowledge sharing website ) , and LINKEDIN ( linkedin.com , a professional contacts website ) — where nodes represent people and edges represent social relationships . These networks are large with up to millions of nodes and edges , and the time span of the data ranges from four months to almost four years . All the networks are in early stages of their evolution with the connected component being small and the clustering coefficient increasing over time .
We consider models that can be decomposed into three core processes , namely , the node arrival process ( governs the arrival of new nodes into the network ) , the edge initiation process ( determines for each node when it will initiate a new edge ) , and the edge destination selection process ( determines the destination of a newly initiated edge ) . Our networks do not include removal of nodes or edges , so we do not model deletion ( although we do model the “ death ” of a node in the sense that it ceases producing new edges ) .
Our results . We begin with a series of analyses of our four networks , capturing the evolution of key network parameters , and evaluation of the extent to which the edge destination selection process subscribes to preferential attachment . We show that the inherently non local nature of preferential attachment is fundamentally unable to capture important characteristics in these networks . To the best of our knowledge , this is the first direct large scale validation of the preferential attachment model in real networks .
Next , we provide a detailed analysis of the data in order to consider parsimonious models for edge destination selection that incorporate locality . We evaluate a wide variety of such models using the maximum likelihood principle and choose a simple triangleclosing model that is free of parameters . Based on the findings , we then propose a complete network evolution model that accurately captures a variety of network properties . We summarize our model based on the three processes listed earlier .
Node arrival process . We find large variation in node arrival rates over the four networks , ranging from exponential to sub linear growth . Thus we treat node arrival rate as input to our model .
Edge initiation process . Upon arrival , a node draws its lifetime and then keeps adding edges until reaching its lifetime , with edges inter arrival rate following a power law with exponential cut off distribution . We find that edge initiations are accelerating with node degree ( age ) , and prove that this leads to power law out degree distributions . The model produces accurate fits and high likelihood .
Edgedestinationselectionprocess . We find that most edges ( 30%– 60 % ) are local as they close triangles , ie , the destination is only two hops from the source . We consider a variety of triangle closing mechanisms and show that a simple scheme , where a source node chooses an intermediate node uniformly from among its neighbors , and then the intermediate node does the same , has high likelihood .
Our model is simple and easy to implement .
It precisely defines the network evolution process , and we also give parameter settings that allow others to generate networks at arbitrary scale or to take a current existing network and further evolve it . We show that our model produces realistic social network evolution following the true evolution of network properties such as clustering coefficient and diameter ; our purely local model gives rise to accurate global properties .
2 . RELATED WORK
Many studies on online social networks , world wide web , and biological networks focused on macroscopic properties of static networks such as degree distributions , diameter , clustering coefficient , communities , etc ; work in this area includes [ 10 , 21 , 2 , 18 , 8 , 7 ] . Similarly , macroscopic properties of network evolution , like densification and shrinking diameters , were examined [ 16 , 11 , 19 , 13 ] .
Given that the classical Erdös–Rényi model cannot capture the above network characteristics , a number of alternate network models have been proposed . The copying [ 14 ] and the preferential attachment [ 1 ] models belong to this category . The Forest Fire model [ 16 ] attempts to explain the densification and decreasing diameter phenomena observed in real networks . See [ 6 ] for a topic survey .
Recently , researchers examined the finer aspects of edge creation by focusing on a small set of network snapshots . The role of common friends in community formation was analyzed by Backstrom et al . [ 3 ] . Kleinberg and Liben Nowell [ 17 ] studied the predictability of edges in social networks . The role of triangle closure in social networks was long known to sociologists . Simmel theorized that people with common friends are more likely to create friendships and Krackhardt and Handcock [ 12 ] applied this theory to explain the evolution of triangle closures . A network model based on closed triangles was proposed by Shi et al . [ 20 ] .
The maximum likelihood principle has been typically used to estimate network model parameters [ 15 , 22 , 23 ] or for model selection [ 4 ] , which often requires expensive computations of high dimensional integrals over all possible node arrival sequences . In contrast , we use the likelihood in a much more direct way to evaluate and compare different modeling choices at a microscopic level .
3 . PRELIMINARIES
Datasets . For each of our four large network datasets , we know the exact time of all the node/edge arrivals . Table 1 gives the basic statistics of the four networks . All the networks slowly densify with a densification exponent [ 16 ] ρ ≈ 12 All the networks , except DELICIOUS , have shrinking diameter . In FLICKR , ANSWERS , and LINKEDIN , the effective diameter reaches the maximum value of 10 when the network has around 50,000 nodes , and then slowly decreases to the around 7.5 ; in DELICIOUS , the diameter is practically constant . Also , in all the networks , a majority of edges are bidirectional ( column Eb ) . The reciprocity is 73 % in FLICKR , 81 % in DELICIOUS , and 58 % in ANSWERS ; LINKEDIN is undirected , but we know the edge initiator . The fraction of nodes that belongs to the largest weakly connected component is 69 % in FLICKR , 72 % in DELICIOUS , 81 % in ANSWERS , and 91 % in LINKEDIN .
Notation . Let N , E , and T denote the total number of nodes , edges , and the span of the data in days . Let Gt be a network composed from the earliest t edges , e1 , . . . , et for t ∈ {1 , . . . , E} . Let t(e ) be the time when the edge e is created , let t(u ) be the time when the node u joined the network , and let tk(u ) be the time when the kth edge of the node u is created . Then at(u ) = t− t(u ) denotes the age of the node u at time t . Let dt(u ) denote the degree of the node u at time t and d(u ) = dT ( u ) . We use [ · ] to denote a predicate ( takes value of 1 if expression is true , else 0 ) .
Maximum likelihood principle . The maximum likelihood estimation ( MLE ) principle can be applied to compare a family of parameterized models in terms of their likelihood of generating the observed data , and as a result , pick the “ best ” model ( and parameters ) to explain the data . To apply the likelihood principle , we consider the following setting : we evolve the network edge by edge ,

Figure 1 : Probability pe(d ) of a new edge e choosing a destination at a node of degree d . and for every edge that arrives into the network , we measure the likelihood that the particular edge endpoints would be chosen under some model . The product of these likelihoods over all edges will give the likelihood of the model . A higher likelihood means a “ better ” model in the sense that it offers a more likely explanation of the observed data . For numerical purposes , we use log likelihoods .
4 . PREFERENTIAL ATTACHMENT
In this section we study the bias in selection of an edge ’s source and destination based on the degree and age of the node . 4.1 Edge attachment by degree
The preferential attachment ( PA ) model [ 1 ] postulates that when a new node joins the network , it creates a constant number of edges , where the destination node of each edge is chosen proportional to the destination ’s degree . Using our data , we compute the probability pe(d ) that a new edge chooses a destination node of degree d ; pe(d ) is normalized by the number of nodes of degree d that exist just before this step . We compute :
[ et = ( u , v ) ∧ dt−1(v ) = d ] .
|{u : dt−1(u ) = d}|
. t
. pe(d ) = t
First , Figure 1(a ) shows pe(d ) for the Erd˝os–Rényi [ 9 ] random network , Gnp , with p = 12/n . In Gnp , since the destination node is chosen independently of its degree , the line is flat . Similarly , in the PA model , where nodes are chosen proportionally to their degree , we get a linear relationship pe(d ) ∝ d ; see Figure 1(b ) .

Figure 2 : Average number of edges created by a node of age a . Next we turn to our four networks and fit the function pe(d ) ∝ dτ . In FLICKR , Figure 1(c ) , degree 1 nodes have lower probability of being linked as in the PA model ; the rest of the edges could be explained well by PA . In DELICIOUS , Figure 1(d ) , the fit nicely follows PA . In ANSWERS , Figure 1(e ) , the presence of PA is slightly weaker , with pe(d ) ∝ d09 LINKEDIN has a very different pattern : edges to the low degree nodes do not attach preferentially ( the fit is d0.6 ) , whereas edges to higher degree nodes are more “ sticky ” ( the fit is d12 ) This suggests that high degree nodes in LINKEDIN get super preferential treatment . To summarize , even though there are minor differences in the exponents τ for each of the four networks , we can treat τ ≈ 1 , meaning , the attachment is essentially linear . 4.2 Edges by the age of the node
Next , we examine the effect of a node ’s age on the number of edges it creates . The hypothesis is that older , more experienced users of a social networking website are also more engaged and thus create more edges .
Figure 2 plots the fraction of edges initiated by nodes of a certain age . Then e(a ) , the average number of edges created by nodes of age a , is the number of edges created by nodes of age a normalized by the number of nodes that achieved age a : e(a ) =
|{e = ( u , v ) : t(e ) − t(u ) = a}|
|{t(u ) : t' − t(u ) ≥ a}|
, where t' is the time when the last node in the network joined .
Notice a spike at nodes of age 0 . These correspond to the people who receive an invite to join the network , create a first edge , and then never come back . For all other ages , the level of activity seems to be uniform over time , except for LINKEDIN , in which activity of older nodes slowly increases over time . 4.3 Bias towards node age and degree
Using the MLE principle , we study the combined effect of node age and degree by considering the following four parameterized models for choosing the edge endpoints at time t .

Figure 3 : Log likelihood of an edge selecting its source and destination node . Arrows denote τ at highest likelihood .
• D : The probability of selecting a node v is proportional to its current degree raised to power τ : dt(v)τ . • DR : With probability τ , the node v is selected preferentially ( proportionally to its degree ) , and with probability ( 1 − τ ) , uniformly at random : τ · dt(v ) + ( 1 − τ ) · 1/N ( t ) . • A : The probability of selecting a node is proportional to its age • DA : The probability of selecting a node v is proportional the product of its current degree and its age raised to the power τ : dt(v)· at(v)τ . raised to power τ : at(v)τ
Figure 3 plots the log likelihoods under different models , as a function of τ . The red curve plots the log likelihood of selecting a source node and the green curve for selecting the destination node of an edge .
In FLICKR the selection of destination is purely preferential : model D achieves the maximum likelihood at τ = 1 , and model DA is very biased to model D , ie , τ ≈ 1 . Model A has worse likelihood but model DA improves the overall log likelihood by around 10 % . Edge attachment in DELICIOUS seems to be the most “ random ” : model D has worse likelihood than model DR . Moreover the likelihood of model DR achieves maximum at τ = 0.5 suggesting that about 50 % of the DELICIOUS edges attach randomly . Model A has better likelihood than the degree based models , showing edges are highly biased towards young nodes . For ANSWERS , models D , A , and DR have roughly equal likelihoods ( at the optimal choice of τ ) , while model DA further improves the log likelihood by 20 % , showing some age bias . In LINKEDIN , age biased models are worse than degree biased models . We also note strong degree preferential bias of the edges . As in FLICKR , model DA improves the log likelihood by 10 % .
We notice that selecting an edge ’s destination node is harder than selecting its source ( the green curve is usually below the red ) . Also , selecting a destination appears more random than selecting a source — the maximum likelihood τ of the destination node ( green curve ) for models D and DR is shifted to the left when compared to the source node ( red ) , which means the degree bias is weaker . Similarly , there is a stronger bias towards young nodes in selecting an edge ’s source than in selecting its destination . Based on the observations , we conclude that PA ( model D ) performs reasonably well compared to more sophisticated variants based on degree and age .

Even though our analysis suggests that PA is a reasonable model for edge destination selection , it is inherently “ non local ” in that edges are no more likely to form between nodes which already have friends in common . In this section we perform a detailed study of the locality properties of edge destination selection .
We first consider the following notion of edge locality : for each new edge ( u , w ) , we measure the number of hops it spans , ie , the length of the shortest path between nodes u and w immediately before the edge was created . In Figure 4 we study the distribution of these shortest path values induced by each new edge for Gnp ( with p = 12/n ) , PA , and the four social networks . ( The isolated dot on the left counts the number of edges that connected previously disconnected components of the network . )
For Gnp most new edges span nodes that were originally six hops away , and then the number decays polynomially in the hops . In the PA model , we see a lot of long range edges ; most of them span four hops but none spans more than seven . The hop distributions corresponding to the four real world networks look similar to one another , and strikingly different from both Gnp and PA . The s e g d e f o r e b m u N

Figure 4 : Number of edges Eh created to nodes h hops away . h = 0 counts the number of edges that connected previously disconnected components .
Figure 5 : Probability of linking to a random node at h hops from source node . Value at h = 0 hops is for edges that connect previously disconnected components . number of edges decays exponentially with the hop distance between the nodes ( see Table 1 for fitted decay exponents κ ) . This means that most edges are created locally between nodes that are close . The exponential decay suggests that the creation of a large fraction of edges can be attributed to locality in the network structure , namely most of the times people who are close in the network ( eg , have a common friend ) become friends themselves .
These results involve counting the number of edges that link nodes certain distance away . In a sense , this overcounts edges ( u , w ) for which u and w are far away , as there are many more distant candidates to choose from — it appears that the number of long range edges decays exponentially while the number of longrange candidates grows exponentially . To explore this phenomenon , we count the number of hops each new edge spans but then normalize the count by the total number of nodes at h hops . More precisely , we compute
. ( # nodes at distance h from the source node of et )
[ et connects nodes at distance h in Gt−1 ]
. pe(h ) = t
. t
First , Figures 5(a ) and ( b ) show the results for Gnp and PA models . ( Again , the isolated dot at h = 0 plots the probability of a In Gnp , edges new edge connecting disconnected components . ) are created uniformly at random , and so the probability of linking is independent of the number of hops between the nodes . In PA , due to degree correlations short ( local ) edges prevail . However , a non trivial amount of probability goes to edges that span more than two hops . ( Notice the logarithmic y axis . )
Figures 5(c)–(f ) show the plots for the four networks . Notice the probability of linking to a node h hops away decays doubleexponentially , ie , pe(h ) ∝ exp(exp(−h) ) , since the number of edges at h hops increases exponentially with h . This behavior is drastically different from both the PA and Gnp models . Also note that almost all of the probability mass is on edges that close lengthtwo paths . This means that edges are most likely to close triangles , ie , connect people with common friends .
Figure 6 : Triangle closing model : node u creates an edge by selecting intermediate node v , which then selects target node w to which the edge ( u , w ) is created .
Column EΔ in Table 1 further illustrates this point by presenting the number of triangle closing edges . FLICKR and LINKEDIN have the highest fraction of triangle closing edges , whereas ANSWERS and DELICIOUS have substantially less such edges . Note that here we are not measuring the fraction of nodes participating in triangles . Rather , we unroll the evolution of the network , and for every new edge check to see if it closes a new triangle or not . 5.1 Triangle closing models
Given that such a high fraction of edges close triangles , we aim to model how a length two path should be selected . We consider a scenario in which a source node u has decided to add an edge to some node w two hops away , and we are faced with various alternatives for the choice of node w . Figure 6 illustrates the setting . Edges arrive one by one and the simplest model to close a triangle ( edge ( u , w ) in the figure ) is to have u select a destination w randomly from all nodes at two hops from u .
To improve upon this baseline model we consider various models of choosing node w . We consider processes in which u first selects a neighbor v according to some mechanism , and v then selects a neighbor w according to some ( possibly different ) mechanism . The edge ( u , w ) is then created and the triangle ( u , v , w ) is closed . The selection of both v and w involves picking a neighbor of a node . We consider five different models to pick a neighbor v of u , namely , node v is chosen

Table 2 : Triangle closing models . First pick intermediate node v ( fix column ) , then target node w ( fix row ) . The cell gives percent improvement over the log likelihood of picking a random node two hops away ( baseline ) .
• random : uniformly at random , • degτ : proportional to degree raised to power τ , d(v)τ , • com : prop . to the number of common friends c(u , v ) with u , • lastτ : proportional to the time passed since v last created an • comlastτ : proportional to the product of the number of com edge raised to power τ , mon friends with u and the last activity time , raised to power τ .
As stated before , we can compose any two of these basic models to choose a two hop neighbor , ie , a way to close the triangle . For instance , the last0.1 com model will work as follows : u will employ the last0.1 model to select node v , v will employ the com model to select node w , and then u will add an edge to w , closing the triangle ( u , v , w ) . We consider all 25 five possible composite models for selecting a two hop neighbor and evaluate them by the likelihood that the model generated all the edges that closed lengthtwo paths in the real network .
Table 2 shows the percent improvement of various triangle closing models over the log likelihood of choosing a two hop neighbor uniformly at random as a destination of the edge ( the baseline ) . The simplest model , random random , works remarkably well and has many desirable properties . It gives higher probability to nodes with more length two paths , discounting each path by roughly 1/d(v ) . Moreover , it is also biased towards high degree nodes , as they have multiple paths leading towards them .
The deg1.0 random model weighs each node w by roughly the number of length two paths between u and w . However , we find that it performs worse than random random . For the more general degτ random , the optimal value of τ varies from 0.1 to 0.3 over all the four networks , and this model provides meaningful improvements only for the ANSWERS network .
The com model considers the strength of a tie between u and v , which we approximate by the number of common friends c(u , v ) of nodes u and v ; the larger the value , the stronger the tie . By selecting v with probability proportional to c(u , v ) , we get a substantial gain in model likelihood . A factor that further improves the model is the

Figure 7 : Exponentially distributed node lifetimes . recency of activity by v , captured by lastτ . By selecting nodes that have recently participated in a new edge with higher probability , we get another sizable improvement in the model likelihood . These two capture the finer details of network evolution .
In summary , while degree helps marginally , for all the networks , the random random model gives a sizable chunk of the performance gain over the baseline ( 10% ) . Due its simplicity , we choose this as the triangle closing model for the rest of the paper .
Note that the above methodology could be extended to edge creations other than triangle closing . We chose to focus on the triangle closing edges for two reasons . First , a high fraction of all edges created fall into this category , and hence an understanding of triangle closing edges is an important first step towards understanding the overall network evolution . Second , with the exception of quite simplistic models , it is computationally infeasible to compute the likelihood at a distance greater than two hops as the number of nodes and possible paths increases dramatically .
6 . NODE AND EDGE ARRIVAL PROCESS In this section we turn our focus to the edge initiation process that determines which node is responsible for creating a new edge ( Section 6.1 ) , and then to the process by which new nodes arrive into the network ( Section 62 ) 6.1 Edge initiation
In the following we assume that the sequence and timing of node arrivals is given , and we model the process by which nodes initiate edges . We begin by studying how long a node remains active in the social network , and then during this active lifetime , we study the specific times at which the node initiates new edges .
611 Node lifetime
To avoid truncation effects , we only consider those nodes whose last created edge is in the first half of all edges in the data . Recall that the lifetime of a node u is a(u ) = td(u)(u ) − t1(u ) . We evaluate the likelihood of various distributions and observe that node lifetimes are best modeled by an exponential distribution , p'(a ) = λ exp(−λa ) . Figure 7 gives the plot of the data and the exponential fits , where time is measured in days . In Table 5 , the row corresponding to λ gives the values of fitted exponents . We note that the exponential distribution does not fit well the nodes with very short lifetimes , ie , nodes that are invited into the network , create an edge and never return . But the distribution provides a very clean fit for nodes whose lifetime is more than a week . degree d

Figure 8 : Edge gap distribution for a node to obtain the second edge , δ(1 ) , and MLE power law with exponential cutoff fits .
612 Time gap between the edges
Now that we have a model for the lifetime of a node u , we must model that amount of elapsed time between edge initiations from u . Let δu(d ) = td+1(u ) − td(u ) be the time it takes for the node u with current degree d to create its ( d+1) st out edge ; we call δu(d ) the edge gap . Again , we examine several candidate distributions to model edge gaps . Table 3 shows the percent improvement of the log likelihood at the MLE over the exponential distribution . The best likelihood is provided by a power law with exponential cutoff : pg(δ(d ) ; α , β ) ∝ δ(d)−α exp(−βδ(d) ) , where d is the current degree of the node . ( Note that the distribution is neither exponential nor Poisson , as one might be tempted to assume . ) We confirm these results in Figure 8 , in which we plot the MLE estimates to gap distribution δ(1 ) , ie , distribution of times that it took a node of degree 1 to add the second edge . In fact , we find that all gaps distributions δ(d ) are best modeled by a power law with exponential cut off ( Table 3 gives improvements in log likelihoods for d = 1 , . . . , 5 and the average for d = 1 , . . . , 20 . )
For each δ(d ) we fit a separate distribution and Figure 9 shows the evolution of the parameters α and β of the gap distribution , as a function of the degree d of the node . Interestingly , the power law exponent α(d ) remains constant as a function of d , at almost the same value for all four networks . On the other hand , the exponential cutoff parameter β(d ) increases linearly with d , and varies by an order of magnitude across networks ; this variation models the extent to which the “ rich get richer ” phenomenon manifests in each network . This means that the slope α of power law part remains constant , only the exponential cutoff part ( parameter β ) starts to kick in sooner and sooner . So , nodes add their ( d + 1)st edge faster than their dth edge , ie , nodes start to create more and more edges ( sleeping times get shorter ) as they get older ( and have higher degree ) . So , based on Figure 9 , the overall gap distribution can be modeled by pg(δ|d ; α , β ) ∝ δ−α exp(−βdδ ) . s e d o N

Figure 10 : Number of nodes over time .
Given the above observation , a natural hypothesis would be that nodes that will attain high degree in the network are in some way a priori special , ie , they correspond to “ more social ” people who would inherently tend to have shorter gap times and enthusiastically invite friends at a higher rate than others , attaining high degree quickly due to their increased activity level . However , this phenomenon does not occur in any of the networks . We computed the correlation coefficient between δ(1 ) and the final degree d(u ) . The correlation values are −0.069 for DELICIOUS , −0.043 for FLICKR , −0.036 for ANSWERS , and −0.027 for LINKEDIN . Thus , there is almost no correlation , which shows that the gap distribution is independent of a node ’s final degree . It only depends on node lifetime , ie , high degree nodes are not a priori special , they just live longer , and accumulate many edges . 6.2 Node arrivals
Finally , we turn to the question of modeling node arrivals into the system . Figure 10 shows the number of users in each of our networks over time , and Table 4 captures the best fits . FLICKR grows exponentially over much of our network , while the growth of other networks is much slower . DELICIOUS grows slightly superlinearly , LINKEDIN quadratically , and ANSWERS sublinearly . Given these wild variations we conclude the node arrival process needs to be specified in advance as it varies greatly across networks due to external factors .
7 . A NETWORK EVOLUTION MODEL
We first take stock of what we have measured and observed so far . In Section 6.2 , we analyzed the node arrival rates and showed that they are network dependent and can be succinctly represented by a node arrival function N ( t ) that is either a polynomial or an In Section 6.1 , we analyzed the node lifetimes and exponential . showed they are exponentially distributed with parameter λ . In Section 4.1 , we argued that the destination of the first edge of a

Table 4 : Node arrival functions . node is chosen proportional to its degree ( ie , preferentially attached ) . In Section 6.1 , we analyzed the time gaps between edge creation at a node and showed they can be captured by a power law with exponential cutoff , with parameters α , β . In Section 5 , we showed that most of the edges span two hops , and the simple random random triangle closing model works well . Motivated by these observations , we now present a complete network evolution model . Our model is parameterized by N ( · ) , λ , α , β , and operates as follows .
1 . Nodes arrive using the node arrival function N ( · ) . 2 . Node u arrives and samples its lifetime a from the exponen tial distribution p'(a ) = λ exp(−λa ) .
3 . Node u adds the first edge to node v with probability propor tional to its degree . 4 . A node u with degree d samples a time gap δ from the distribution pg(δ|d ; α , β ) = ( 1/Z)δ−α exp(−βdδ ) and goes to sleep for δ time steps .
5 . When a node wakes up , if its lifetime has not expired yet , it creates a two hop edge using the random random triangleclosing model .
6 . If a node ’s lifetime has expired , then it stops adding edges ; otherwise it repeats from step 4 .
The values of N ( · ) for the four networks are given in Table 4 and the values of α , β , λ are given in Table 5 .
Note that one could also use more sophisticated edge placement techniques , like random surfer model [ 5 ] or other triangle closing techniques as discussed in Section 51 For example , in step 5 , a node u can pick a sequence of nodes ( u = w0 , w1 , . . . , wk = w ) , where each wi is picked uniformly from the neighbors of wi−1 , and the sequence length k is chosen from the distribution in Figure 4 . Node u then links to w . 7.1 Gaps and power law degree distribution
We now show that our model , node lifetime combined with gaps , produces power law out degree distribution . This is interesting as a model of temporal behavior ( lifetime plus gaps ) gives rise to a network property .
THEOREM 1 . The out degrees are distributed according to a power law with exponent 1 + λΓ(2−α ) βΓ(1−α ) . of the gap distribution pg(δ|d ; α , β ) :

Let a be the lifetime sampled from the exponential distribution p'(a ) = λ exp(−λa ) . Recall the edge creation process : a node adds its first edge and samples the next gap δ(1 ) according to pg(· ) , sleeps for δ(1 ) time units , creates the second edge , samples a new gap δ(2 ) according to pg(· ) , sleeps for δ(2 ) units , and so on until it uses up all of its lifetime a . This means that for a node u with lifetime a = a(u ) and final degree D = d(u ) , we have

Thus , the degree distribution in our gap model follows a power law with exponent 1 + λ/μ , completing the proof .
Validation of the model . We validate the accuracy of our modeling assumptions by empirically estimating the lifetime λ , and gap distribution α , β parameter values for each network . We then apply Theorem 1 , which yields the power law degree exponents produced by our model . Then we empirically measure the true power law degree exponents of the four networks and compare them to predictions of Theorem 1 . Table 5 shows the results . Note the predicted degree exponents remarkably agree with the true exponents , validating our model . This is interesting as we specified the model of temporal node behavior ( lifetime+gaps ) that results in a accurate structural network property ( power law degree distribution ) . 7.2 Unfolding network evolution
To further our understanding of the network evolution , especially the edge creation process , we perform the following semisimulation . We consider the real network GT /2 and evolve it from t = T /2 , . . . , T using the random random model to obtain a network Gfi T . At the end of the evolution , we compare the macroscopic properties of Gfi T and GT . For completeness , we also compare the results to the vanilla PA model .
More precisely , we evolve GT /2 by considering all the edges that were created after time T /2 between the nodes in GT /2 . ( We do not allow new nodes to join GT /2 . ) We consider two different processes to place these new edges . In the first process ( PA ) , we select two nodes preferentially , with probabilities proportional to their degrees , and add an edge . In the second process ( RR ) , we use the random random triangle closing model , ie , we first select a node preferentially and then pick a node two hops away using the random random model . i

Figure 11 : We take FLICKR network at first half of its evolution . Then we simulate the evolution using our model and PA for the second half , and compare the obtained networks with the real FLICKR network . Notice our model matches the macroscopic statistical properties of the true FLICKR network very well , and in fact much better than PA .
Figure 11 shows results for FLICKR : clustering coefficient , degree distribution , and pairwise distance histogram for the true data , and the two simulations . The random random model matches the true network well and outperforms than the PA process . Similar results also hold for other networks ; we omit these plots for brevity .
8 . CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we present a microscopic analysis of the edge byedge evolution of four large online social networks . The use of the maximum likelihood principle allows us to quantify the bias of new edges towards the degree and age of nodes , and to objectively compare various models such as preferential attachment . In fact , our work is the first to quantify the amount of preferential attachment that occurs in networks .
Our study shows that most new edges span very short distances , typically closing triangles . Motivated by these observations , we develop a complete model of network evolution , incorporating node arrivals , edge initiation , and edge destination selection processes . While node arrivals are mostly network specific , the edge initiation process can be captured by exponential node lifetimes and a “ gap ” model based on a power law with exponential cutoff . We arrive at an extremely simple yet surprisingly accurate description of the edge destination selection in real networks . Our model of network evolution can be used to generate arbitrary sized synthetic networks that closely mimic the macroscopic characteristics of real social networks .
